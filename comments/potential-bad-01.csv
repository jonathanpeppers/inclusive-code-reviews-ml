"> I guess if it was OK for BindableLayout, it should be OK for Map too?

Either that, or we made a terrible mistake merging 5582. That implementation of Replace in `Apply` is very suspect.

It looks like Map.Pins is an `ObservableCollection<Pin>`, so while I don't like this implementation of `Apply`, it should be fine for this purpose. It looks like the implementation of `ObservableCollection` only uses `NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Replace` for a single item being set. So at least for this specific application, it shouldn't cause any immediate problems.

"Possibly this is an example of me trying to outsmart the compiler and in the end doing something stupid 😄 Was trying to achieve inlining this method in its usages, given that it's just a simple expression, to avoid unnecessary calls to this method. The compiler will be smart enough to inline it without the attributes?"
"As a side note, the reason fixing this is important even given the obvious uselessness of the construct `const {} = anything` is that we ought to be able to deliver accurate completions inside the `{}`. Prior to this fix, you got both `a` and `b` since that’s what `T` had in its domain, but as soon as you accept the `a` completion, the contextual type changes and therefore the inference changes and it becomes an error, which is a terrible experience."
"It's sad to see that the work on this seems to have come to a halt.
Implementing would-be-convenient functionality now requires insane workarounds.

Bumping this again, in hope to see this released ♥️"
"This is where we call into the action constraints. 

The reasons that I went this way instead of using something new to solve the problem:
- This is the simplest thing to do for now
- I'm not sure how common this requirement is outside of MVC.

The thing that this solves is selecting between a GET endpoint and a POST endpoint, etc. It seems obvious someone layering a CMS on top of MVC needs this functionality. Maybe I am just being stupid and this needs to be *built-in*."
"> Shouldn't this be done in the other ctor?

Yes, absolutely right! I knew to do that earlier then for some reason started working on something else and forgot about it. Thanks for catching that.

> Also how do you feel about passing in an ILogger \ ILoggerFactory instead to the ctor? This feels a little gross. This feels a little gross.

I did this because we already take a `serviceProvider`, so why complicate things for the consumer? Under what circumstances would someone have reason to supply a different `ILogger` than the one the service provider would offer? I'm not absolutely set against it, but would like to make a choice based on practical reasoning.

In the long term, we may need to consume other services too. If we keep adding them as extra constructor overloads one-by-one, it will not be a nice experience for consumers."
I flipped this because _calling the destructor manually is terrible._
"holy shit this whole function is magic

"
Gross. OK.
"@github could this be something as stupid as not giving mlaunch enough time to finish?

Here's a good run:

```

That took 22 seconds to return any results

Here's a bad one:

Timeout is 30 seconds

How close to the wire is it getting?"
python3 wtf. Is there an easy way to run on the same hardware? Also do I need to manually patch bits and run before and after?
