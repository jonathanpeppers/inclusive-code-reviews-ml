"Oh interesting. So you've got this implemented as ""in _structural_ order"" navigation. I suppose I imagined this as in ""in _id order_ navigation"".

So for example:


**EXAMPLE A:**
```
 +-------------+        
 | +---+ +---+ |        
 | |   | |   | |        
 | | 1 | | 3 | |        
 | |   | |   | |        
 | +---+ +---+ |        
 +-------------+        
 | +---+ +---+ |        
 | |   | |   | |        
 | | 2 | | 4 | |        
 | |   | |   | |        
 | +---+ +---+ |        
 +-------------+
```

structural order: `[<- 1 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 4 ->]`

**EXAMPLE B:**

```
 +-------+-------+
 | +---+ | +---+ |
 | |   | | |   | |
 | | 1 | | | 3 | |
 | |   | | |   | |
 | +---+ | +---+ |
 | +---+ | +---+ |
 | |   | | |   | |
 | | 2 | | | 4 | |
 | |   | | |   | |
 | +---+ | +---+ |
 +-------+-------+
```

structural order: `[<- 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 ->]`



Hmm. Maybe structural makes more sense. Cause in the case where we've got some panes that are opened and closed and opened, the ID order might be insane. Consider example B, close 3&4, then make a new vertical split (5), then close 2, then open a new split off 5 (6), then make a new split off 1 (7)
```
 +-------+-------+
 | +---+ | +---+ |
 | |   | | |   | |
 | | 1 | | | 5 | |
 | |   | | |   | |
 | +---+ | +---+ |
 | +---+ | +---+ |
 | |   | | |   | |
 | | 7 | | | 6 | |
 | |   | | |   | |
 | +---+ | +---+ |
 +-------+-------+
```
Now the structural order is: `[<- 1 <-> 7 <-> 5 <-> 6 ->]` which makes way more sense than `[<- 1 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 7 ->]`

"Since the return type is MonoWasmEventPipeSessionID maybe it should be a cast to that. Also, if EventPipeSessionID becomes 64-bit later and the return value is somehow 32-bit, I think this would be a wrapping conversion which could cause a non-zero EventPipeSessionID to become 0? I guess that's what the assert is for but it feels gross to do the assert on something other than the actual return value, I would prefer to assert on the (post-cast) return value instead."

Done - #34420

>> HashCodeCombiner

>What do you suggest? Removing is breaking, we could obsolete it and/or implement on top of System.HashCode?

My suggestion is to make the breaking change in `5.0` (which I've done in this PR). It was just added in `3.0` (mistakenly since it was a shared source file, and the type is public), and if anyone is using it, they shouldn't be. Also, if they were using it - it would collide with the same type in PlatformAbstractions. So I think we can make this small break, so we don't have to worry about it going forward."
"For me the bug fix in 6.0 was to late, I went life with 5.0 rc1,publishsinglefile  and a simple workaround:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Convert App.config to myAppname.Settings.json
```
using System.Text.json;
public static class xxx ...
static Dictionary<String, String> settings=null;      
        // centralized access to ConfigurationManager
        public static String AppSetting(String setting)
        {
           if (settings ==null)
            {
                var jsontext = File.ReadAllText(""<myAppname>Settings.json"");
                settings = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Dictionary<String, String>>(jsontext);               
            }
            if (settings.ContainsKey(setting))
            return settings[setting];
            else
                return setting;
            //return ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[setting];
        }
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ConfigurationManager (in my opinion) has 2 disadvantages:

1. The rename step of App.config with assembyname.dll.config (lack of transparency)
2. The rename step of ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration didn't help me with this issue.

Keep it simple keep it stupid (KISS) would be to give the (relative or Full) Path of the config file not the path of the exe-file 
The main reason for the usage of PublishSingleFile was the saving of filespace.
I wonder why you cant fix it with 5.0.1 or 5.0.2 while 6.0 will arrive in November 2021 ?"
"A good example for 1) is this code:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/523221/131215895-e8052fc5-55b4-4f66-8bcf-a75a34d34557.png)

"Your example of the final state looks good, but this interim state feels unacceptable. It churns all this code and we'll just have to change it all again later. Is there some way we can stage this without making everything gross in the interim?"
"`=` is lazy, `:=` is strict.

    foo = hi $(bar)
    bar = one
    $(info $(foo))
    bar = two
    $(info $(foo))

prints ""hi one"" ""hi two""

    foo := hi $(bar)
    bar := one
    $(info $(foo))
    bar := two
    $(info $(foo))

prints ""hi "" ""hi "" (empty var).

The first behavior seems incredibly insane, so having the default for most variable assignments be `:=` is good style.

Note it gets weird with recursive variables (e.g. our use of `MSBUILD_ARGS`):

    MSBUILD_ARGS = $(MSBUILD_ARGS) /some:switch

makes things get upset (""`Recursive variable 'MSBUILD_ARGS' references itself (eventually).  Stop.`"")."

"Not a terrible idea."
"Jared and I have discussed this separately before. There are probably multiple viable ways to go but I think that exposing a compiler-known way to suppress constraint checks on specific APIs would do it. Then, I'm hoping that conversion errors at the use site will prevent the APIs from being used when the type arguments don't permit it.

```cs
using System;

namespace System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis
{
    public sealed class SuppressConstraintChecksAttribute : Attribute { }
}

ref struct Span<T> allow T : ref struct
{
    [SuppressConstraintChecks]
    public Span(T[]? array) { ... }

    [SuppressConstraintChecks]
    public static implicit operator Span<T>(T[]? array) { ... }
}

class Program
{
    static void M(Span<Span<int>> span)
    {
        var span1 = new Span<Span<int>>(null); // error: can't convert 'null' to type 'Span<int>[]'
        var span2 = (Span<Span<int>>)null; // error: can't convert 'null' to type 'Span<int>[]'
    }
}
```

This might leave a hole where the attribute could be used on methods which only violate type parameter constraints within the implementation, not in the signature. The user wouldn't be stopped from doing it at compile time but could get a runtime error. That might just be a case of ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"".

Tagging @github who had interest in a 'SuppressConstraintChecksAttribute' for a scenario with static interface members, IIRC."

"@github @github how likely do we think it is that people will implement the IPC protocol without using our DiagnosticClient library? We already know that the OpenTelemetry guys implemented their own, I suspect other profiler vendors might be inclined to write their own library given how we keep adding profiler stuff to it. It may be worth thinking about users of the lower level pipe too.

That being said, it works how it is and I don't think it's a terrible user experience. I would just like it better if I could open one connection. I don't think it's bad enough to try and make us change it when we've already shipped it."

"> When can WebUtilities.ReasonPhrases.GetReasonPhrase(statusCode) ever be equal to anything other than candidate or string.Empty? 

It can't. I added a test to ensure that any status code defined in `WebUtilities.ReasonPhrases` is also defined in here as a possible candidate.
`WebUtilities.ReasonPhrases.GetReasonPhrase(statusCode)` could be replaced by comparing against the bytes in `candidate`, but the comparrison would be uglier (unless Kestrel has some Ascii byte-char comparrison helper somewhere?)

The fast-path here is `candidate is not null` and `reasonPhrase is null`. We only perform the `Dictionary` lookup if a custom reason phrase is specified.

If this condition fails, it means there is either no candidate OR the custom status code is not the default one, so we create a new one.

I don't see how this could regress the perf for the common case, unless cq is somehow terrible for the different switch statement. I'll look at adding a benchmark for it."

"Based on [these musings](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/3525#issuecomment-523270275), I don't think that this method should look for `[Register]` on an interface to determine if the interface type should be preserved.  The 3rd constructor argument is meaningless, and ~anybody can apply `[Register]` on their type.  (Why they would *do* so, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

```csharp
[Register(""terrible/Example"", """", ""I mean really terrible, no?"")]
public interface IBadExample {
}
```

Instead, I think a *better* indicator would be if `resolvedInterfaceType` implements the `IJavaPeerable` or `IJavaObject` interfaces.  Yes, this can also be done by anyone, but it's also *semantically meaningful*: if the interface implements `IJavaPeerable`/`IJavaObject`, then it can be passed into Java code and gains lots of special abilities (via `Java.Lang.Object` and JCW generation and...):

```csharp
[Register(""better/Example"", """", ""I still don't think that this value is meaningfully used"")]

<hr />

This is an experiment to support Brotli compression in method contexts for SPMI collections.
I picked Brotli because we already have the source in the tree so I believe there are no license considerations.
The main benefit is to reduce the size of collections stored on the disk. I had a hypothesis that for HDDs,
this would also help replay speed because the decompression is faster than reading the full thing. My experiments
seem to indicate that this is true for parallel runs, but I don't think it's for the reason that I expected.

Currently the way Brotli is added is pretty unfortunate as I put it in superpmi-shared and then build it in all the superpmi projects that needs `MethodContext`. It would probably be better to build it once and statically link it, but I don't have the necessary cmake knowledge to do that for this experiment. In total, we are building it separately 5 times (6 times if you include System.IO.Compression).

I measured some of the characteristics of compression vs no compression. For all the experiments I cleared my file cache between each run using [RAMMap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rammap) (Empty -> Empty Standby List).

|                       | Collect time | Ratio |  .mch size | Ratio | .mch.zip size | Ratio | Par replay, SSD | Ratio | Seq replay, SSD | Ratio | Par replay, HDD | Ratio | Seq replay, HDD | Ratio |
|-----------------------|-------------:|------:|-----------:|------:|--------------:|------:|----------------:|------:|----------------:|------:|----------------:|------:|----------------:|------:|
| No compression        | 320.3s       |  1.00 | 3026.9 MiB | 1.00  | 333.5 MiB     | 1.00  | 10.6s           | 1.00  | 155.4s          | 1.00  | 169.6s          | 1.00  | 155.2s          | 1.00  |
| Brotli with quality 5 | 606.4s       | 1.89  |  500.1 MiB | 0.17  | 495.5 MiB     | 1.49  | 10.6s           | 1.00  | 161.4s          | 1.04  | 10.6s           | 0.06  | 162.3s          | 1.05  |

The collect command was:
```cmd
py .\src\coreclr\scripts\superpmi.py collect --pmi -assemblies C:\dev\dotnet\runtime\artifacts\tests\coreclr\windows.x64.Checked\Tests\Core_Root\ -output_mch_path <out_path>
```
Note that the time for collect includes the time for the collection itself, merging/cleaning, building the TOC and doing a test SPMI replay. Also the merging/cleaning steps are quite inefficient because they repeatedly decompress and recompress each method context even when it could just be copied directly from the input to the output. I have not bothered optimizing this but it would probably reduce the time taken for collections significantly.

For the replay commands I invoked superpmi.exe directly with a checked JIT. For parallel runs I passed -p. I think the parallel HDD runs are so much faster because the smaller file means the OS keeps it in memory longer. It seems the striding we use with parallel runs is terrible for HDD performance.

The PR allows method contexts to individually select compression/no compression so even if we don't want it for the smaller collections, we could potentially use it in case we want to have much larger collections in the future.

Are there any comments on whether we want this and what we want for the default (compression or no compression)? And any tips for how to handle the Brotli source files in CMake?

"That link documents the rough structure. But symstore.exe is really the only thing that knows about how any of that actually is. If you were going to try putting it directly in that format, I'd just look at what it takes to shell out to it.

Some background: the insane glob we have is essentially an input to VSTS's task that calls symstore.exe and creates the Symbols folder with the actual layout (identifiable by the magic 000admin folder inside of it.) Your change at least means we could get rid of the insane glob and point it to this folder. I'm OK with that, it just means we have more copies of more stuff.

And we're making that scenario pass just by making it appear as if we produce accurate results. The real scenario of ""classifications are correct for the user"" is not be tested by apex or actually validated.

Fair, some alternatives:

- Update Apex to call GetAllTags(), wait for it to return (signaling that the parse has completed) and then call the regular GetTags() call. This would still require the extender to implement IAccurateTagger<T>.
- Apex subscribes to TagsChanged or ClassificationsChanged for all open text views immediately and exposes a method for waiting for update _n_ and getting the tags raised. The weakness of this approach is that changes to the event raising pattern would break the test."

"Thinking about it some more, would it really be a breaking change? I know almost everything can be considered breaking in a mature framework, but this maybe isn't so terrible to just add precision.

I too spent way too much time tracing this down when i was reading time stamps in from a file. I kept scrutinizing my parser for bugs because the behavior of this method is counter-intuitive (at least to me). 

An alternative API would be fine for me too, perhaps `AddTotalMilliseconds` or something."
"Do we know the cases where this happens? Did **user code** initiate a background operation? Or do we have a bug that leads to `AddToRenderQueue` being called from outside the sync context?

If this is happening because **we are** running operations outside of the sync context then these are bugs that need to be fixed 😆 

If user code did this (let's say you set up a timer) then this could be OK if the **only** thing user code is doing is triggering a render. 

Let's suppose you've got a TODO list, and you're checking a webservice at intervals to update the list. Inside that TODO list you have a dictionary that tracks the TODO items.  If you have a sequence of operations like the following:
1. Update items
2. Trigger a render

You think you're OK because the render happened last right? Well what if a render was happening while you did step 1? This would crash with an unpredicatable error because dictionary is not thread safe. So you need a lock around all property access and rendering. 

It's never safe to access state that's needed during rendering from a BG thread, and it would be gross to use a lock to protect it. The most reasonable thing is to dispatch to the FG thread and let the sync context act-as a zero-overhead lock.

What's worse is that this *might* succeed. It might work pretty well most of the time, but when it fails the error is total nonsense, or it leads to data loss. In the UI frameworks that protect against this explicitly, you at least get a really clear failure message.

To be clear the bug is in step 1. You can't update the state of a component from a background thread, which might mean that an explicit dispatching mechanism *is* needed in these scenarios. It's OK to do step 2 (notify the renderer to do work), but that's the only thing that's safe.

I think I need to know a little more about this, I'm hesitating because I'm still not totally sure why this is needed.

Please forgive me for not having time to reply a few days ago.

This is not necessary, but just a suggestion for the following reasons.

1. From Android API 24 to 23, it is not difficult for Android. They are all official.

2. API 21 app will run on approximately 98.6% of devices, and API 24 app only has 91.7%. The is from Android studio.

3. Using androidx.webkit increases the size of Android installation package a little and the performance loss is almost negligible.

4. It makes the Android device compatibility of Maui Blazor consistent with Maui.

5. My test method is temporarily modified the namespace of Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebView.Maui.csproj and only compile it with min Android API 21, so that it can be directly added to the Maui blazor app project, and then tested on the real machine of Android 5(API 21). The startup speed is acceptable, which is 40% faster than blazor WebAssembly. This is stupid, but simple and effective.

"Let us forever burn this mistake into our memories. Today will be remembered as """"In No State chANging Equals"" day, or ""INSANE"" for short."
"""null"" means ""task of null""? (no insane @github stuff here? :smile:)"
"It's more of a meta gripe than anything. Now that we can annotate reference types with nullability, having a null string here is more akin to an implementation detail of _not_ having an output path. 

```C#
public Solution WithProjectOutputRefFilePath(ProjectId projectId, string outputFilePath);

public Solution WithProjectwithNoOutputRefFilePath(ProjectId projectId)
```

The terrible naming aside, the above has a more meaningful call pattern. We either want a path, or we want to make it so the project doesn't have one. Null may be how we rationalize that, but it's just a well known magic value. It doesn't tell you, for example, if that ends up succeeding and having some default value when you pass in null. 

Not worth blocking, for sure, just more of a thought about the meaning of null to represent absence or clearing of a value from an API perspective."
"Argh, I was wondering why the stack overflow would happen there.
I guess that makes [my rather stupid fix obsolete](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/134188) 😅 - Thank you!

~I wonder why `b` is so large though. The amount of bracket pairs should be limited by the viewport/minimap size. I should investigate why the minimap is requesting these decorations anyway.~

I think it is not good to request *all* decorations at any point, I'll have to look into that.
"
"Agree with reverting the overloads. 
That gross `object` cast is gross, but it could not be prevented, in order to keep common signature.
Luckily, this would not be an issue for the roslyn generated code and this dynamic resolution would not be there at all."
"One thing you can consider is hacking SPMI to produce a table of functions with the # instructions executed for each context. That might help narrow into if it's expected.
We already have the # instructions executed on a per-method basis, so it should not be too hard. For example, stupid and simple thing would be to just print `baseMetrics.NumExecutedInstructions` here:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/0d0fd755e859f020cd087f53edc2dc812489755e/src/coreclr/tools/superpmi/superpmi/superpmi.cpp#L374

and then post process this into something."
"OK, I went and checked again because I recalled that this is expected for Linux:
https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=38201
There is no posix primitive for us to use here, I think? Same reason abandoned mutex detection isn't possible without coreclr's extremely complex workaround. I'm not aware of any way to stop someone from rm'ing a file I have open. The only thing I could come up with is grepping lsof to find anyone else with the lock open, but the performance implications of that are profound and it's gross (even though the documentation suggests that lsof is meant to be used this way)

.Lock(0, 0) and .Unlock work everywhere, which is why I'm using them, but sadly I can't use those to block deletion - you can still delete a file that has a lock held on it, and then create a new file with the same name in its place."

"> This will also fix LSP ddrits flakiness by allowing it to force tag computation (apex APIs rely on IAccurateTagger).

"> I wonder if they've tried just constructing the catalog and graph once, and sharing the resulting ExportProviderFactory for all tests, but each individual test gets its own ExportProvider? That sounds like it would be the best combination of perf and test isolation.

Roslyn has switched back and forth between sharing the actual ExportProvider and just sharing the catalog around 5 times now. It alternated between ""oh goodness, the perf!"" and ""oh goodness, we're sharing test state!"" that it made me wonder if everybody was suffering from memory loss. :smile: I want to say last time the switch was done was prior to us moving to VS MEF (and might predate VS MEF itself....?), and at the time creating a new composition while reusing the catalog was cheap, but once you have 50,000 tests doing that and it's more expensive than the five lines of actual code being tested, you start to get second thoughts. :smile:

@github I'm OK with this going in. I suspect it's still going to bite us eventually but I think that trap has already been set...

Awhile back I tried giving a shot at decoupling all the MEF shared state to also be strict about tests that are free-threaded (and can run in parallel) and tests that need a concept of a UI thread and it was a terrible rat hole. We had some tests that'd casually spin up a WPF text view on a random xunit test thread and weren't careful about that, or other sorts of fun.

<hr />

This PR unrolls `Equals`/`StartsWith` for ""half"" constant strings and spans in [0..32] chars length.
It does pretty much the same job as https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/64821 but in JIT this time to avoid problems listed there (e.g. low inliner's budget and throughput penalty). I decided to create a new PR to keep that as a reference (""what can be done in pure C#"").

This PR handles the following APIs:

```csharp
String.Equals(string s1, string s2)
String.Equals(string s1, string s2, StringComparison.Ordinal)

strObj.Equals(string s1)
strObj.Equals(string s1, StringComparison.Ordinal)
strObj.StartsWith(string s1, StringComparison.Ordinal)

MemoryExtensions.SequenceEqual<char>(ROS<char> s1, ROS<char> s2)
MemoryExtensions.Equals(ROS<char> s1, ROS<char> s2, StringComparison.Ordinal)
MemoryExtensions.StartsWith(ROS<char> s1, ROS<char> s2, StringComparison.Ordinal)
```
It unrolls & vectorizes them when either s1 or s2 are constants for [0..32] utf16 chars range using SWAR, SSE, AVX or AdvSimd (arm64).

The existing code can be re-used to handle:
- `Span.CopyTo`
- `OrdinalIgnoreCase` for any case this PR already handles for just Ordinal
- UTF8 string literals or RVA data (e.g. either, hopefully, upcoming Utf8String literals or [ufcpp/StringLiteralGenerator](https://github.com/ufcpp/StringLiteralGenerator)).
- [unlikely] CurrentCulture case if we add ""IsAscii or fallback"" check

## Motivation:
I've seen quite a few `SequenceEqual` against constant data in high-perf scenarios e.g. ""is input one of the well-known headers?"" or e.g. TechEmpower: https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/master/frameworks/CSharp/aspnetcore/PlatformBenchmarks/BenchmarkApplication.cs#L98 - mostly on UTF8 inputs (I plan to support those eventually), but UTF16 are also not rare.

Also, https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/65222 relies on this PR.

## Example:
```csharp
bool Test1(string s) => s.StartsWith(""https://"", StringComparison.Ordinal);

bool Test2(string s) => s == ""Access-Control-Allow-Credentials"";
```
New codegen:
```asm

There are minor block layout issues but they're unrelated. The algorithm has a pretty simple heuristic (budget) to avoid doing too many unrolls in a single method.

## Simple benchmark
```csharp
[Benchmark]
[Arguments(""https://google.com"")]
public bool StartsWith(string s) => s.StartsWith(""https://"", StringComparison.Ordinal);
```
|     Method |                 Toolchain |      Mean |     Error |    StdDev | Ratio |
|----------- |-------------------------- |----------:|----------:|----------:|------:|
| StartsWith |    \Core_Root\corerun.exe | 3.8516 ns | 0.0050 ns | 0.0045 ns |  1.00 |
| StartsWith | \Core_Root_PR\corerun.exe | 0.4802 ns | 0.0019 ns | 0.0015 ns |  0.12 |

NOTE: `OrdinalIgnoreCase` performance is terrible and if we implement it here we'll get something like this:

For this issue though, we could try using [`filter`](https://github.com/bevacqua/insane#filter) on the `style` element. I suspect though that this is both going to be tricky to get right (unless you enforce a super restricted format like that regular expression does) and it opens up feature requests to add more  style properties in the future.

I have this idea that `boost::container::small_vector` probably isn't the ideal inner-type here either and we'll want to drop in a `std::pmr::vector` as soon as @github works out the kinks in #8787 on how to set up the templates to accept allocators as these are a great place to use a memory pool from my perf traces.

"Commit message for review:

```markdown
Context: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/6356
Context: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/6357

We found an incremental build in a `dotnet new android` app with C#
code changes has this duration:

	100 ms  LinkAssembliesNoShrink                     1 calls

It turns out we don't actually need to run `<LinkAssembliesNoShrink/>`
against the ""main"" assembly in .NET 6.  After passing in
`$(TargetName)` and simply copying the file, this time improved to:

	  9 ms  LinkAssembliesNoShrink                     1 calls

This change should improve incremental C# changes by ~91ms in
`dotnet new android` projects.

In ""Xammie"" Xamarin.Android, it is possible for an application project
to reference a class library with a higher `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)`;
see [warning XA0105 docs][0].

We cannot apply this optimization for Xamarin.Android.

However, in thinking about and revisiting this code, we've made two
determinations for future work:

  * XA0105 being a warning is a terrible idea, as it can allow apps
    to crash via `TypeLoadException`.

    See xamarin/xamarin-android#6356.

  * .NET 6 builds don't emit [XA2000 warnings][1] when a referenced
    assembly references `AppDomain.CreateDomain()`.  This isn't
    desirable, as `AppDomain.CreateDomain()` is still part of the
    .NET Standard 2.0 API contract, and thus could still be used,
    even though it won't work.  *Something* should warn if
    `AppDomain.CreateDomain()` is referenced, to reduce the need for
    manual app testing.

    See xamarin/xamarin-android#6357.

"I went through the test failure for `ValidateAggregationWithReferenceTrackerObject`.

While doing that, I also realised that the `WeakReferenceTest` is still disabled. I tried enabling it. The part of the test that validates using a local (not globally registered) ComWrappers instance passes (after a fix in the test project). The parts trying to use a globally registered instance to re-hydrate after the managed object is collected fail. https://github.com/elinor-fung/runtime/commit/01c4a622947be818c4da9da0a02caa3cfcf8cf33 enables the test, but for non-Windows, only does validation using a local ComWrappers instance.

Turns out we still have a bunch of functionality around setting/getting COM weak reference info that is just under `FEATURE_COMINTEROP`. I tried for a bit to enable it - it definitely has more layers than the sync block cleanup - will unpeel for a bit longer.

@github / @github - thoughts on treating the `WeakReference`  as support to be added after this PR (like the global instance for marshalling / Marshal APIs)?

NativeAOT currently goes through a helper call whenever we need to access static fields. For this simple program:

```csharp
class Program
{
    static int s1, s2;
    static int Main() => s1 + s2;
}
```

We generate:

```nasm
repro_Program__Main:
sub         rsp,28h
call        __GetNonGCStaticBase_repro_Program
mov         edx,dword ptr [rax]
add         edx,dword ptr [rax+4]
mov         eax,edx
add         rsp,28h
ret

__GetNonGCStaticBase_repro_Program:
lea         rax,[?__NONGCSTATICS@repro_Program@@]
ret
```

It's not terrible, but also could be better. As far as I can see, JitInterface cannot express the exact way static fields are accessed in NativeAOT. I had a previous attempt to use the existing JitInterface facilities in https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/5131 (misusing the facilities that exist to support RVA static fields), but it didn't generate ""nice"" addressing modes and couldn't support GC statics (see the disassembly there).

I'm adding a way to do that with ""nice"" addressing modes. After this change, the above program compiles into:

```nasm
repro_Program__Main:
mov         eax,dword ptr [?__NONGCSTATICS@repro_Program@@]
lea         rdx,[?__NONGCSTATICS@repro_Program@@]
add         eax,dword ptr [rdx+4]
ret
```

There's room for improvement:
* It would be nice if we could similarly inline these lookups when we're in shared generic code
* I think the addressing mode could be more compact if RyuJIT generated a reloc with a delta on x64.
* It would be nice if we could do this if there's a static constructor. .NET Native could inline the ""did static constructor already run?"" checks. There was a previous attempt at that in https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/12420 (and corresponding https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/3962).

"I believe using explicit linked files is actually super terrible to maintain and port future analyzers/fixer/tests. After having attempted this both ways (using the existing add of linked files and then with shared projects), I think using shared projects is way easier for porting more analyzers/fixers as well as viewing the existing ported shared analyzers and fixers. Lets discuss both these approaches in the meeting today, I can open up the solution from this branch.

Regardless, as mentioned in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/38480#issuecomment-578903218, I think neither of these are really good long term solutions and we should eventually just move these analyzers/fixers completely into CodeStyle layer and ship CodeStyle NuGet with the SDK."

"@github We actually have two sanitization passes currently, one from `marked` and one from `insane`. The `insane` is the more complete sanitizer so we probably don't need the marked one.

What worries me though is that by allowing markdown strings to use `style`, we open up the surface area both in terms of security and presentation. Now an extension can use arbitrary css in hovers, including loading images or positioning content outside of the hover itself. 

Github's sanitizer for markdown previews strips out `style` attributes for these reasons (and also I believe because `style` could at one point be used in very old browsers to run scripts and do other super unsafe things)

"@github glad you asked

well, at least we shouldn't have multiple caches... TypeConversionExtensions.KnownConverters, TCE.KnownConverterFactories, BindableProperty.KnownTypeConverter; and then we have NodeILExtensions.KnonwnCompiledTypeConverters

Type Conversion happens at multiple places:
- when setting a value from xaml
- when applying a binding (this includes AppThemeBinding, DynamicResource, ...)
- when applying a style

ColorTypeConverter and ThicknessTypeConverter do _not_ need to be cached in a known list, as they are attributed with a TypeConverterAttribute, they need to be in the KnownCOMPILEDTypeConverter as they're not attributed with the ProvideCompiledAttibute.

The only converter that can not be retrieved using reflection is UriTypeConverter as System.Uri is NOT attributed on .NET core 6 (even though System provides a UriTypeConverter that we should use now that we replaced our own base TypeConverter type by System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter. Side note, System.Uri is attributed in the net framework profile, go figure). so why do we whitelist ColorTypeConverter and EasingTypeConverter in BindableProperty.cs is something that need clarification.

I don't recall the details of why FontTypeConverter need to be whitelisted, but I recall that we almost got rid of Font as a property type in most (all?) of our controls (because compound properties are a mess and produce too many propertychange events, and redraw).

We could/should cache the TypeConverters:
- at runtime when we encounter them
- at startup time using reflection (fuck no)
- or at compile time using a sourcegen
Our own TypeConverters are known beforehand, but I'm not keen on maintaining a list of those (I'd prefer a sourcegen), but there's also the TypeConverters defined in 3rd party assemblies. Oh, and caching type converters isn't a solution for avoiding reflection, as TypeConverterAttributes on properties take priority over the ones defined on Type, but we could cache that too (using the PropertyInfo as key e.g.)

To summarise this digression on TypeConverters, here's a list of action points:
- [ ] Investigate the usage of `Font` in Controls. It's probably unused, in that case `FontTypeConverter` and the 2 caches in TypeConversionExtension could go away
- [ ] Investigate `Font` usage in Core, and the reason it was ported there, and not deprecated
- [ ] Investigate why ColorTypeConverter and EasingTypeConverter are whitelisted
- [ ] Investigate caching TypeConverters for properties and types. I'd recommend going for a sourcegen solution and generate a switch instead of a dictionary to avoid allocation bump
- [ ] None of our TypeConverters have any side effect, and instances could be reused (we can speak for 3rd party converters, unfortunately...)"

"Hey @github, I guess I can answer to that 😄

There are a couple places where I'm using that API in the MVVM Toolkit, and they're indeed in a performance oriented type.
They're only being used on values being of private types, coming from private fields, and guaranteed to be correct due to the implementation of the type itself, so the only way this could break is if a dev actually tried to mess up with the internal fields using reflection, which is something that not even types from the BCL guard against, as far as I can tell (eg. `Memory<T>` will break the type safety too in the `Span` property getter if a dev used private reflection to store some arbitrary object there).

In particular, there's a usage of the `Unsage.As<T>(object)` API in the MVVM Toolkit that just can't be worked around without having to sacrifice quite a fair bit of performance and more memory usage, which is this line [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/blob/79127cf6a76ea1b0673c0376e43d41f91b2df509/Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm/Messaging/StrongReferenceMessenger.cs#L400-L404):

```csharp
// Assume we have these locals
object handler;
object recipient;
TMessage message;

// Here we perform an unsafe cast to enable covariance for delegate types.
// We know that the input recipient will always respect the type constraints
// of each original input delegate, and doing so allows us to still invoke
// them all from here without worrying about specific generic type arguments.
Unsafe.As<MessageHandler<object, TMessage>>(handler)(recipient, message);
```

Basically I have the following situation:

- I have this delegate type, which is used to register message recipients with the ability to specify both the recipient type (so the input to the lambda expression is already of the right type and they don't need to cast), and the message type:

```csharp
public delegate void MessageHandler<in TRecipient, in TMessage>(TRecipient recipient, TMessage message)
    where TRecipient : class
    where TMessage : class;
```

- As you can see from the delegate, `TRecipient` is always a reference type
- The messenger class will guarantee that always the right recipients are passed

So doing that unsafe cast basically tricks the runtime into just calling the `Invoke` method of each actual handler just with an input `object` type (as we don't know the type used in each handler here) - we're essentially invoking a contravariant delegate as if it was covariant in that input argument. Again this is always guaranteed to be a valid type cast due to how the messenger itself works - each recipient will always match the original `TRecipient` constraint in each delegate being invoked. This way we get identical codegen to just invoking those handlers directly, even if we lack knowledge on each type in use.

The alternatives I've considered here would've been:
- Use `Delegate.DynamicInvoke`, which is just terrible for performance/memory usage. We wanted to have the broadcast method have an amortized allocation cost equal to 0, and also to avoid using reflection completely in this implementation.
- Wrap each input handler in another one with just an `object` parameter. This would've meant to completely defeat the whole point of structuring delegates this way to allow the C# compiler to cache them (as they're static), as we would've had to allocate a new display class capturing the input delegate every single time one was registered. Also each broadcast would've had twice the number of virtual calls, as each handler would've had to go through its proxy one doing the recipient cast first.

This is something I've actually talked about quite a bit with @github and @github too in the C# Discord server. Given the exact specifications of this type and the way it's implemented, using this trick should be perfectly valid, as all the various constraints and unsafe casts will always be guaranteed to be valid, so there will never be a type violation in doing so. This is really just a workaround for a lack of proper support for basically doing the equivalent of ""try to invoke this delegate with these inputs, and just throw if they are not valid"". With the exception that here we already know the inputs are valid, so we don't even check.

In an ideal world (as in, with you guys having unlimited time and budget to implement all sorts of proposals even for less requested features), my idea was that `DynamicInvoke` could be implemented as a JIT intrinsic, with the EE engine emitting the code there to just do safe casts of the inputs and throw otherwise - that way all the reflection would be avoided and the resulting codegen would be almost the same as just `Invoke`, with the only difference being the checks for the input parameters and boxing of value type parameters, if any, but that'd be perfectly acceptable. This is just a way to achieve that with the current runtime 🚀

On the other hand, as a result of this and a number of other (less unsafe) optimizations this new implementation is both much faster than all other competitor types from other common libraries, and using virtually no memory at all for broadcasts:

"> Consider a method that does 100 string comparisons against constant strings. Are all these 100 string comparisons going to be optimized, without hitting inliner's budget?

so no budget for `s == ""55555555""

> Also, it would be interesting to measure JIT time of a method like this (before/after).

since it can't do 100 Equals I don't see anything terrible and in general I guess there are not so many, I also tested the test I added - no visible effects.

What is nice is that for non-unrollable cases jit ignores those calls as it is able to remove simple dead branches during import.

Any opinion on this? It feels great to be able to declare rules to unroll stuff in pure C# but yeah, several long equals can eat inliner's budget and we won't be able to inline other stuff in the current root.

"## Friday Spec Brownbag Quick Summary
Today we had a meeting about this spec. Here's some quick notes of how the discussion went.
Attended: @github, @github, @github, @github, @github, @github    

### Launch Methods
- Unanimous ""launch inside the tab"", not a new window
- Matches other tabbed things like browsers
- New window will naturally come when we solve tab tear-off
- Launching settings another time will just activate the existing tab

### Preview Window in Appearance Page
- Unanimous yes. Do this. TermControl with a new connection that isn't real, just filled with some dummy sample text like what people might use (emojis, powerline fun, text tables, colors, etc.)

### Editing/Saving
- Automatic saving: No. We don't want to thrash the JSON file. If we had an in-memory model struct... maybe. Or if we were using a tear-off window, maybe.
- OK, Cancel, Apply and/or a ""Save"" button and a ""Preview Now"" button. No. Gross. Old. Maybe temporarily during the prototype so the person doing the prototype only has to write two event handlers. But no. The preview window should be automagic on changes. The actual JSON should be written on Save button
- Save button. Yes. Do this. Prevents JSON thrashing. We will have a little preview window anyway.

### Navigation
- Align with JSON: Ehhhhh. We could be more robust.
- More description navigation: Yes, do this. Unanimous.
    - ""General General"" is weird. We should find something else for that. General > Basic, General > (categories, like ""Launch"", ""Rendering"", ""Interactivity"", etc.)
		- We need a rocket ship icon for ""Launch""
    - It's ok to have few items on a page/category. Looked at some other ideas like how Visual Studio and some other Terminals like iTerm, xterm, etc. do it.


### Keyboard Bindings
- A listview sort of thing - Carlos and Kayla seemed more on board with this one up front.
- A grid sort of thing - Michael, Mike, Dustin seemed more on board with this one up front.

(I didn't catch which one Leon was up with)

- We don't think we have a readily available grid control
- Lots of comparison to iTerm, xterm, and other terminals to see what they do
- Examples given of other software that tends to do keybindings in a grid style
- Discussion on whether we should have some sort of modal dialog when adding a binding that lets people press a key-combo to make it instead of typing it out
- Discussion on combo/text boxes for the commands to be mapped
- Discussion on what to do with commands that have arguments
	- Commands with arguments that are already stringable by the command palette (e.g. new tab 1, new tab 2) are offered as drop down items
	- Commands with arguments that are complex could be presented with a ... in the grid on the edge that launches a modal with the raw JSON to be edited
		- Perhaps place the schema describing how to write conforming arguments/bindings on the left and have a text editor or JSON editor on the right
		- Validate schema on close, stitch the JSON fragment back in
		- In the future, can migrate some of the ...s to launch a more robust editor based on the situation of the type of command, but default will allow raw editing if there is no specialty editor

- For the listview, specifically discussing how we can show the arguments or have some sort of embedded arguments editing below it

- Concern with both of them about amount of whitespace/compactness and good use

- Concern with how to display/present the commands that people might not know about (easily buried in a dropdown/combo)

- Any way to tree/hierarchy/group the similar commands together? 
"
"OK, so after talking this one out with other ppl on the team, I believe this was a stupid suggestion on my side. 

IDEs ask for errors on files in no specific order. with this in place the error will keep appearing and disappearing randomly. i think we are better off having the error on every use. We already report errors on every use for decorators. so this should just be the same. I think we can just remove this check, and keep the error.

Sorry for the bad suggestion. "
"Maybe separately, we should do better on tuples since this is so stupid."
"I deleted the comment because we discussed it offline. To make you look less insane, I was asking why it wasn't called `getReferenceHighlights`.
"
"Tagging this ""needs design review"" for one concern about whether we want to be overloading go to _definition_ for this particular feature, since I don't think I would imagine this really correlates to a ""definition"" at all. We might be able to make some UI affordances to the user to help out what is going on (change the text of the right click menu to say ""go to control flow destination"" or something to that effect when you're actually on one of these tokens).

Also a few things that might be helpful:

1. Should invoking on return in a method jump to the invocation of that method if there's one, or show the selection if there's multiple? The local function case at least might be handy.
2. Should invoking throw jump to a catch block, at least if there's a matching one in the method? (The control flow analysis can of course get insane here but maybe the same-method case could still be useful....?) #Closed"
"~The GitHub app is terrible so I can't review properly, but test 5 uses a function type returning `void | undefined`. That's probably a mistake.~

Resolved"
"Yea, you could(should) definitely expose that method on AppKeyBindings. Parsing them again would be insane :P

I'd rather you do it in this PR, rather than blocking your PR on mine getting in"
"Thanks, @github 

I've just tried the sequence of [the above GIF](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/pull/8215#issuecomment-729949956) in a PowerShell:

```ps
sleep 3;""^G""
```

Then quickly minimized the window and nothing happens. I.e. nothing flashing.

I'm using:

- German Windows 11, 64-bit
- PowerShell-Tab, run as Administrator
- Terminal Preview version 1.13.10984.0

Probably I'm just doing something stupid and/or missing some plain obvious things.

----------

Trying it from a [.NET console application](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/8713#issuecomment-756181568) with:

```c#
Console.Write(""\u001b[G"");
```

also does not flash the task bar icon.

-----------

OK, I think I get it now:

The [""BellStyle"" setting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/profile-advanced#bell-notification-style) was not set explicitly, thus resulting in only a sound (which was not hearable since I turned of all system sounds).

After configuring the CMD type to this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/415439/169705439-7f6f2d25-f58a-4bbc-8814-22250398daa6.png)

My C# console application was able to make the task bar flash/be lightened when using this:

```c#
Console.Write(""\a"");
```

Resulting in this effect:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/415439/169705615-949aeaff-d3fa-4f2f-8037-ced5fe4ecdca.png)


I'm still unable to do the same for PowerShell and `sleep3;""^G""` but since I do need it for CMD only, not PowerShell, this is sufficient for me.

----------------

### Update:

After reading [Dustin's reply](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/pull/8215#issuecomment-1133933312), this one worked correctly in PowerShell:

```ps
sleep 3;[char]0x7
```"
"This is a really gross pattern.  Can we rename this to something like EnsureInitialized and not do the ref to a field thing?

"There is one ***huge*** issue with BigInteger as it stands currently, its default constructors.

The BigInt Class' constructors are all conversions to other datatypes making it inefficient and limited while BigInt *already* has a method coded in which uses *string* input **and is really what you should use when actually utilizing BigInt** called the `Parse()` method. The issue of the type conversion is *especially* magnetized for BigInt because of how it was intended for and why it was made, as the official microsoft documentation of BigInteger states (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.biginteger?view=netcore-3.1)

> The BigInteger type is an immutable type that represents an arbitrarily large integer whose value in theory has no upper or lower bounds. 

which is unlike every other type in the default constructor which means simply writing `System.numerics.BigInteger.new(10000000000000000000000000000);` **will not** work because you aren't explicitly trying to convert the number to the `double` datatype which also still has a max value, 179769313486231570814527423731704356798070567525844996598917476803157260780028538760589558632766878171540458953514382464234321326889464182768467546703537516986049910576551282076245490090389328944075868508455133942304583236903222948165808559332123348274797826204144723168738177180919299881250404026184124858368, but it is large enough to handle most things, however, numbers will not get automatically converted to double type, they need to be explicitly defined with the ""d"" suffix like `10000000000000000000000000000d` but as double still has it's limits, this still goes against the purpose of Bignteger since as soon as you do `179769313486231570814527423731704356798070567525844996598917476803157260780028538760589558632766878171540458953514382464234321326889464182768467546703537516986049910576551282076245490090389328944075868508455133942304583236903222948165808559332123348274797826204144723168738177180919299881250404026184124858369d` the double datatype will stop working. The biggest ""*inexplicitly defined type*"" would be the uLong type which has the highest value of a measly `18446744073709551615`. Since the constructor will always attempt to convert the number to a different type, as it stands it is 

1. Inefficient; tries to convert the arguments to another datatype and go through their constructors which also will cause longer computation times and    

2. Has limitations; it will not work when trying to define an actual ""arbitrarily large integer"" like tested  by multiple people in this Stack Overflow question (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62974138/bigint-inconsistencies-in-powershell-and-c-sharp)

So these constructors go against how BigInt is supposed to be by design, a datatype for *arbitrarily large integers* and having numbers too big for the base constructor goes against what BigInt is supposed to be. However, BigInt *can* handle these ""arbitrarily large integers"" and *can* handle infinitely large things with the parse method. The `Parse()` method takes string arguments so it is theoretically infinite there and works properly. So why have that as just a method? Why not turn that into a constructor? Isn't that just stupid to not have it as a constructor if it literally satisfies what BigInt is supposed to be when as it currently stands does not? You already have all of the code for the `Parse()` method so why not just use it? Just copy + paste, anyone can do this! If the `Parse()` method *does* work as intended and how BigInt is supposed to be but the constructors can't, why wouldn't you just add the `Parse()` method as a constructor for string overloads?"
"When can this fix be expected or is there a temporary workaround? Android user experience is terrible without this feature."
"We are now ignoring ""unknown"" errors. There are no tests for this, because these errors are unknown and therefor we don't know how to reproduce it, but we definitely should not be swallowing these.

Assuming `result.BytesTransferred` is 0 given an unkown error (which seems like a safe bet), then the error will get logged as a FIN which is terrible for debugging.

```suggestion
                    // This is unexpected.
                    error = result.SocketError;
                    SocketsLog.ConnectionError(_logger, this, error);
```"
"> This doesn't work in the case of refactorings at the start of a fiel :) (which do exist) :)

I don't follow.

> Can you point to what you mean?

Imagine [this](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-a2c30b83123c3cb46ac84dae8175bc4bR24) accepts null and we want to pass `null` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fR68) (carries info ""didn't register specific TextSpan"") .  The `RegisterRefactoring` [just calls](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fL86) `_registerRefactoring` lambda with given parameters and so if we want to call it with `null` the [lambda](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fR30) needs to be of type `Action<CodeAction, TextSpan?>` (has to accept nullable `TextSpan`).

The lambda, however, isn't an implementation detail. It gets set in [*public* constructor](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fR52). And that leaks the information that the registration should somehow work with Nullable `applicableToSpan` 🤷‍♂️.

It's not terrible, nobody outside probably uses the constructor. But it _just feels weird_. Either have it nullable explicitly in `RegisterRefactoring` (but that communicates wrong idea about it being optional) or have it nowhere.

> Note: we [still support](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fR45) the original constructor without `TextSpan applicableToSpan` parameter 

"
">  There should be no need for shift. Ideally, we could just ""subtract"" the modifier key from the keybinding. But would that be a difficult behavior to explain/understand?

I'm worried that might not totally work. Think of an insane person, who definitely wants to be able to select text with WASD, and an _interesting_ set of modifiers:
```jsonc
// Cell Selection
{ ""keys"": [""shift+w""], ""command"": { ""action"": ""moveSelectionPoint"", ""direction"": ""up"" } },
{ ""keys"": [""ctrl+a""],  ""command"": { ""action"": ""moveSelectionPoint"", ""direction"": ""left"" } },
{ ""keys"": [""alt+s""],   ""command"": { ""action"": ""moveSelectionPoint"", ""direction"": ""down"" } },
{ ""keys"": [""d""],       ""command"": { ""action"": ""moveSelectionPoint"", ""direction"": ""right"" } },
```

You can't really ""subtract shift"" from those modifiers 😕 "
"**edit:** everything is working now, see https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/pull/10972#issuecomment-907345963

I took a pass at trying to get multi window saving working (didn't start on loading yet, which seems easier all things considered). The initial behavior that I started to implement was to just save the layout of all windows every `x` seconds and/or when the last window closes. 

Roughly the architecture/call stack as currently implemented is

monarch app host calls GetAllWindowLayouts -> propagate to monarch -> for each peasant call GetWindowLayout -> peasant triggers GetWindowLayoutRequested -> window manager -> app host handles event -> calls logic/page -> back up to peasant -> monarch returns back down to app host -> call logic to save in ApplicationState.

The WIP commit is https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/commit/fa54b144acd94e224535d671240d37f4bde8564c

I spend an excessive amount of time trying to get a stupid `hstring` returned up the chain to the peasant, before  finally giving in and making a managed class that just wraps a string.

Unfortunately, I hit a wall as soon as I got the monarch window working because I needed to make the event async to handle switching to/from the ui thread since peasants on everyone except the monarch have different threads. This comment sums up my current thoughts and tribulations

">uint options seems correct since a C# int is a C long, so a C# uint is a C unsigned long:

That is only true on Windows (i.e. C `long` is always 32-bits). On non-Windows the `long` is typically 32-bits on a 32-bit CPU and 64-bits on a 64-bit CPU.

Yeah, and we're not really changing these tests all the time. I did just add a ""nice to have"" where it all goes to a .g.cpp file though. So this process is now so much easier!

How did we come up with the test cases that are failing currently but shouldn't be? Just logically working out what they _should_ be doing? Was there some sort of reference app that you used to construct these cases? (this is merely a curiosity)

Updated the README to talk a bit more about this, actually. There's kinda two types of tests that we're skipping for now:
1. we're wrong: I used MS Word to test what the behavior should be and added them to the CSV file as `skip=false`. Then, when they fail in TAEF, I double check that I translated MS Word correctly.
2. for #6986: we'll need _a lot_ of tests to make sure this works correctly. The idea here is that anything past the ""document end"" will be treated as a degenerate range at document end. So this is gonna be a really nice transition where I'll just update the CSV appropriately and generate/run the tests."

"diff is terrible, but this code is almsot the same.  Generally the logic is similar to: if we have an initializer like `var = new X()` leave it alone (we know the type of it). If we have `X x = new()` change that to `new X()`.  Otherwise, insert an explicit cast from the expression to the final local type.  This ensures the expr keeps the same meaning and affects code the same way in all the places it is inlined to."

"Main's corelib is 9.63 Mb (R2R'd)

- `ExtendedDefaultPolicy` without taking PGO into account: 9.83 Mb
- `ExtendedDefaultPolicy` with PGO `JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=10`: 10.10 Mb
- `ExtendedDefaultPolicy` with PGO `JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=0`: 10.17 Mb

`JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=10` means we're fine that inliner won't inline anything in cold blocks (call-sites with real profiles)
`JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=0` means it doesn't affect the BenefitMultiplier anyhow for cold blocks (so we still can inline calls in them). By default, I use `5` as a balance.

Here is the jit-diff (PMI mode) without taking PGO into account: https://gist.github.com/EgorBo/8e44063324ec21ba29c636a79d7e871c

### Improvements
Most of the size improvements come from ""don't inline anything in BBJ_THROW blocks"", e.g.:
```csharp
if (x == null)
    throw new ArgumentNullException(SR.InvalidArgument); // get_InvalidArgument() is inlined here
```
both `ArgumentNullException.ctor` and `get_InvalidArgument` aren't inlined anymore. A good example is  `LowLevelLifoSemaphore:ReleaseCore(int):this` diff: https://www.diffchecker.com/Wlfl2Lde
***
There are some interesting examples where inlining leads to smaller size, e.g. 
```csharp
static GCHandle Test(object? value) => GCHandle.Alloc(value);
```
Diff: https://www.diffchecker.com/kCYnyUge
^ Inliner managed to detect foldable branches in the `GCHandle`'s constructor and inlined it, see [here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/fc4a42746d9cf65ad3db4074207069ab9c168bc9/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/InteropServices/GCHandle.cs#L62) and its [ctor](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/fc4a42746d9cf65ad3db4074207069ab9c168bc9/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/InteropServices/GCHandle.cs#L32-L54).
***
Another example - it's now able to inline `string.Equals` when we compare literals, e.g. `if (strArg.Length == 0)` is recognized as a foldable branch due to the fact we can now recognize 'get_Length' call, example:
```csharp
bool foo(string str) => str == ""hello"";

bool test() => foo(""hello"");
```
Diff for `test`: https://www.diffchecker.com/vPVxpDl1
***
There are some diffs due to PMI trying to instantiate `Vector<T>` with unsupported T (e.g. char) and inliner helpes here too, e.g. https://www.diffchecker.com/ElRZpnyh
***
`GC:AllocateArray(int,bool):ref` is smaller after inlining: https://www.diffchecker.com/AZKH3aiG
***
Same for `ASCIIUtility:NarrowUtf16ToAscii(long,long,long):long`: https://www.diffchecker.com/yS7ttpfS
***
Same for `HillClimbing:GetWaveComponent` https://www.diffchecker.com/iXaeRtBj
***
Same for `DiyFp:GetBoundaries(int,byref,byref):this` https://www.diffchecker.com/jkjH7mRo
***
Same for `Task:GetActiveTaskFromId(int):Task` https://www.diffchecker.com/7o91kyyE
***
Misc: https://www.diffchecker.com/olDdSxqM, https://www.diffchecker.com/XddHJSrd, https://www.diffchecker.com/3I81EWAo
***
There are cases where ExtendedDefaultPolicy doesn't inline what was inlined by the previous inliner - I tried to avoid it, but there were cases where I'm not sure we should inline, e.g this call https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/Directory.cs#L63 is inlined despite being quite complex: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/Common/src/System/IO/FileSystem.Attributes.Windows.cs#L25-L35
Old inliner detected here ""arg feeds const test"" and added a big multiplier. It did so because IL scan was not quite accurate and had many false positives. However, this method will still be inlined with PGO (and I am sure we have one for this in the static profile we ship). **UPD** I slightly added some boost in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/52708/commits/05a19e57d879bf9ba9d271a7bfb8efeb2b97c58c.

## Size regressions
These are the cases where inlining increases the size but hopefully for better performance.
```

***
Overall I don't see anything terribly wrong so far (e.g. terrible spills because of too-many-locals), I spent the whole week on fixing the regressions and now it's more or less fine.
Performance benefits aren't as good as they used to be with a way more aggressive inliner but I'm going to investigate what exactly led to such improvements and send separate PRs. At least currently I don't see any impact on ""time to first request"", I'll publish the first results once my [script](https://gist.github.com/EgorBo/a1ab453bf41a5369aa54b4c4fba6bea5) finishes.

@github you can pick any method from the jit-diff and I'll explain with the diffs what exactly happened."

No need to call layout when the inside of the grid changes. The contract with layout is: you call it when the size (or position) of the entire grid box changes."

"> The first change adds CNS_INT long 0 Fseq[_00] for source field in the field by field assignments even when offset is 0.

Hmm, I suspect that the ""proper"" way to do this is to add the address to the ""zero offset field map"". But then I happen to think that this kind of side maps are a terrible idea and that the it's best to keep this information in the IR, in special nodes - `PTR_FLD` and `PTR_IDX`. Basically `LEA`s with field sequences but without suffering from `LEA`s unary/binary split personality disorder. `ADD(x, 0)` should do, with some extra special cases. Haven't checked the actual changes yet but I suppose you may want to make such nodes non-CSE, 0-size/execution cost, 0-level in eval order etc.

"Urgh. Yeah, so there's 2 parts here:

## anchorMode: Toggle
I think where this spec stands, this is fine? You can just use your `moveSelectionAnchor` keybindings normally.

## anchorMode: Hold
The main idea behind ConHost CMD Mark Mode is basically that as long as <kbd>shift</kbd> is held, the 'start' endpoint is static/frozen/held.

> I'm worried that might not totally work. Think of an insane person, who definitely wants to be able to select text with WASD, and an _interesting_ set of modifiers:
> 
> ```js

> { ""keys"": [""alt+s""],   ""command"": { ""action"": ""moveSelectionPoint"", ""direction"": ""down"" } },
> { ""keys"": [""d""],       ""command"": { ""action"": ""moveSelectionPoint"", ""direction"": ""right"" } },
> ```
> 
> You can't really ""subtract shift"" from those modifiers 😕

So, with the logic above, the scenario above might still be acceptable?

| Direction | Move 'start' | Move 'end' |
|--|--|--|
| Up | <kbd>w</kbd> | <kbd>shift+w</kbd> |
| Left | <kbd>ctrl+a</kbd> | <kbd>shift+ctrl+a</kbd> |
| Down | <kbd>alt+s</kbd> | <kbd>shift+alt+s</kbd> |
| Right | <kbd>d</kbd> | <kbd>shift+d</kbd> |

## Alternative Plan
Alternatively, I feel like the safest option would be to have users specifically define controls in Mark Mode vs keyboard selection. I think that might be the _clearest_ way to fix the problem above, but I feel like there's a lot of repeated keybindings set between mark mode and non-mark mode ones. :/

## Alternative Alternative Plan
We could remove the ""anchorMode: Hold"". But then there's no way to replicate a _similar_ behavior to that of ConHost CMD. :( I also think the concept of ""hold"" is still a good one, but the execution is the tough part ugh"

"*Draft release notes*

No terrible hurry on this while this PR is still under active revision, but if I understand correctly, I think once this PR is eventually merged it will enable OpenJDK 11 compatibility for user builds? If that's correct, then it might be appropriate to add release note to `Documentation/release-notes/4567.md` as part of this PR.

Here's a very rough first draft of one possible idea:

```
### OpenJDK 11 build compatibility

The Xamarin.Android build tasks are now compatible with OpenJDK 11.

The primary motivation for this change is that the current preview Android SDK
Build-Tools version 30 rc4 that aligns with the Android 11 Developer Preview
requires JDK 9 or higher to run.

Project authors who are not yet targeting the Android 11 Developer Preview can
continue to use OpenJDK 8.
```

On the other hand, this PR itself might not need a release note, if for example the Visual Studio installer will be updated to provide OpenJDK 11 by default in the same release where OpenJDK 11 compatibility ships. In that case, the main topic in the release notes can be the new default OpenJDK version.

In either case, there will likely be some docs to update, such as: <https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/troubleshooting/questions/jdk9-errors>"
"@github: How insane would it be to build `Mono.Android.dll` ""separately"" for the Android Designer, so that we can `#if` out this logic for on-device use but leave it in for the Designer?

Alternatively, What If™ we moved the logic into a new method, then *removed* that method via the linker when linking apps?"
"Well at least I deterministically am terrible at spelling"
"I'd disagree here: I think there's a beauty to the test classes being self contained. Otherwise we end up with insane inheritance hierarchies that only make what the code is doing _less_ clear. Duplicated code isn't bad; complexity is.

I am curious though why each test has to call .Initialize()...?
"
"@github stupid question, does it run the tree targets all the time? i.e. it would not considered passed until the test passed on the three targets? if so i would keep it to two if we can.
"
"I don't think the original issue was so terrible. You only ran into this case when you were contextually typed by a type with a string literal constituent to begin with. In practice, this is not frequently encountered.

However, @github, I think you'll like the the current implementation a lot better. We now only create a string literal type if the constituent types have a string literal type, not just if their content is equal.

Furthermore, the types are cached in a map of strings to string literal types. Whenever testing the assignability of two string literal types, reference equality kicks in (which is fast).

Additionally, error messages are slightly better because you have a specific literal type to report (i.e. `Type '""Foo""' is not assignable to '""Bar""'.` instead of `Type 'string' is not assignable to '""Bar""'.`).
"
"@github I saw this was done for ObservableItemTemplateCollection for Windows, so I copied that. Mainly just for the dispatcher, but if we pass the view in, then we never have to worry about reaching out into the Application. or Device. worlds.

"> Can we unify these codepaths?

~I tried, but I couldn't come up with a good solution. I tried:~

1. ~Take a SyntaxNode from the method to remove from the candidates~

```CS
RemoveConstructorWithDiagnosticFromCandidates(
            SyntaxNode nodeInMethodToRemoveFromCandidates,
            ImmutableArray<IMethodSymbol> candidates,
            CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```
~This does not work, because in VB you need go to the parent of the declaration and call `contains` on it:~
~`syntaxReference.GetSyntax(cancellationToken)?.Parent?.Contains(nodeInMethodToRemoveFromCandidates) == true)`~

~while in C# the method body is included (and calling `Parent` give you the whole type):~

~`syntaxReference.GetSyntax(cancellationToken)?.Contains(nodeInMethodToRemoveFromCandidates) == true)`~

2. ~Take the IMethodSymbol of the candidate to remove~
```CS
RemoveConstructorWithDiagnosticFromCandidates(
            IMethodSymbol methodToRemove,
            ImmutableArray<IMethodSymbol> candidates)
{
  return (methodToRemove.MethodKind == MethodKind.Constructor)
    ? candidates.Remove(methodToRemove)
    : candidates;
}
```

~Now the whole method has degenerated and also the `RegisterFixData` type needs a new property `MethodToRemove` (making the type somewhat stupid having the properties `MethodCandidates` and `MethodToRemove` :dizzy_face:).~

~Both attempts complicate things and that's why I would prefer to keep the two code paths separated. But maybe you have another idea on how to solve this problem.~

"> Hmm, I suspect that the ""proper"" way to do this is to add the address to the ""zero offset field map"". But then I happen to think that this kind of side maps are a terrible idea and that the it's best to keep this information in the IR, in special nodes - PTR_FLD and PTR_IDX.

I have checked how it works with ""zero offset field map"" and you are right, overall results are better.
`fgAddFieldSeqForZeroOffset(tlsRef, fieldSeq);` has almost all logic that we need, we just not calling it sometimes.

The only downside is that `optAssertionIsNonNull` now cannot understand that it doesn't need a null check in cases like:
```
-A-X----R---              |  \--*  ASG       ref    <l:$22a, c:$229>

------------                 |     \--*  CNS_INT   long   8 
```
The first indirection is done on `LCL_VAR   byref  V25 tmp20        u:2 Zero Fseq[Syntax] $441`, the second on ` LCL_VAR   byref  V25 tmp20        u:2 $440` and after the change they have different VNs, so too hard for `optAssertionIsNonNull`. Probably that behaviour is responsible for other uneccessary null checks, I will look for an exisitng issue tomorrow.
When we had add we skipped it in `optAssertionProp_Ind`:
```
    // Check for add of a constant.
    GenTree* op1 = tree->AsIndir()->Addr();
    while ((op1->gtOper == GT_ADD) && (op1->AsOp()->gtOp2->gtOper == GT_CNS_INT))
    {
        op1 = op1->AsOp()->gtOp1;
    }
```

It is almost 3am, but my brain says that `Fseq` should not affect VN of `LCL_VAR ` (because it is a pointer type, not a real value), but should affect `IND` node on top of it. Does it make sense?"

"@github reordering them would certainly be a better choice, but it isn't trivial for me, as I'm no expert in the details of how the JIT really works. As the reverse p/invoke is added to the prolog/epilog in the flowgraph stage, and the inlined call frame logic is handled during lower; however, I'm not comfortable making such a change myself, as the fix looked to be more involved than I was prepared to handle, and prolog/epilog code is notoriously fussy to get right. That said, if this gets checked in in the current state, I'll open an issue against the JIT team to look at coming up with the more optimal fix. I've been able to get this to reproduce reliably by running the determinism test in a loop under jitstress1 mode, so verifying a more complex fix is not a difficult task.

@github Rare is possibly the wrong word.... possibly, less common would be a better term. There are certainly scenarios in which the reverse pinvoke to pinvoke logic is in the same function, but I don't see that its all THAT common.

I'm pretty sure that we don't have significant test coverage of this scenario in our test beds as the characteristic assertion messages are quite rare."

Those aren't terrible ideas at all! :smile:

> I think you already had some sort of ""context"" object that was beginning to congeal. Perhaps a type that is the ""context"" that contains the trigger, various ""environment"" flags (notably this debugger flag and the interactive flag), and maybe some other pieces of information could become the replacement.

This would need to be a _yet another_ type than the ""context"" object that is passed by the completion service to `CompletionListProvider.ProduceCompletionListAsync`. I'd prefer not to introduce more of these. However, your point is taken. I was modeling CustomTags off of what we did with diagnostics, but perhaps that's not the best approach here.

> Is the debugger flag only being used to control whether we list completion items before their declaration point? And do completion providers get passed an OptionSet from the originating workspace (or can get at it)? If both are ""yes"", then perhaps we should instead have there be a not-UI-exposed completion option that simply specifies that debugger behavior, and the debugger workspace we create just sets that option explicitly. I could imagine people might actually like that behavior during real typing as well. It's not rare that you might write some code and realize you need to use a local declared farther down. Rather than me breaking context, moving the local up, and then writing the code again, that it's perhaps OK to actually complete it anyways. It's I am not saying we should expose it in a UI (at least not until customers come with pitchforks asking for it :smile:), but if they did come along and ask for that we'd implement that with an option. Given that also might fix this problem too, I can't help but notice the coincidence.

This is the most appealing idea. Rather than having flags like IsDebugger and IsImmediateWindow that control random behaviors, capturing those behaviors in options is a good idea. I'll try this one out.

> Rather than having some additional way to shuttle info, this could just be checking the workspace kind. It's still comparing magic strings, but at least without the baggage of extra types.

> > It's also designed to be (partially) AOT friendly by making the core icall not generic.

At one point we had an invoke icall with a generic ```<T>``` return type, but that can't be AOTed (at least right now). So the current one returns object, which is inefficient (and kind of gross in terms of the burden it puts on both the caller and callee). We want strong types both for reliability and small, efficient codegen.

> Also what's wrong with the existing `mono_wasm_invoke_js` ? (besides that it should not have `eval` and live in `EM_ASM_INT` macro, which I both fixed in my pending [PR](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/60504/files#diff-aeaa65b0a5528aaf1d5f89c138410cd639839359113f9c6a700efe2f9cf0e2caR479) .)

I could sit down and try to carefully enumerate why I think we need a new icall, but off the top of my head (this was a long design discussion that happened quite a while ago, so it's reasonable to revisit it):
* ```mono_wasm_invoke_js_with_args``` is not a tasteful API - the design does not have the traits of a good maintainable API. During the review for custom marshalers some of the same traits (weak types, boxing etc) that came up there as no-go apply to it as well.
* It's hard to optimize without compatibility breaks (for example, requiring that the method name be interned), and it's easy to hit performance pitfalls by using it in an inefficient way. Taking an object[] arg basically guarantees bad performance (the only real way to optimize the allocation out requires a ThreadLocal to be safe.)
* Many JS functions return undefined, and I think it's inappropriate to silently convert that to a null - it often indicates that you misunderstand the signature of the function you're calling and should be a failure.
* JS functions also happily accept extra arguments and sometimes will work if arguments are missing. This API makes it easy to do that, and I think we should be explicit about argument count. (The current icall doesn't enforce a callee argument count check... I could add that on the JS side if you want but I think there are cases where the callee won't have argument count data.)
* Aside from the general 'hard to optimize' problem I think making every single invoke create GC pressure is a very bad thing. We need to avoid it in the bindings.
* This new icall's signature is basically a cleaned up variation on ```mono_wasm_invoke_js_blazor``` (with the exception that the callee+caller need to collaborate to handle exceptions). I think it's best to ensure our API can efficiently be used to implement blazor, uno, etc.
* For ```mono_wasm_invoke_js```, the overhead of looking up the string literal is nonzero (especially because it's not required to be interned), and not being able to pass arguments requires the caller to do unclean things like shove arguments into globals (which is not a cheap thing to do via the current API... you'd have to do SetObjectProperty per-argument.)

My endgame for this is that we use source generators to create strongly-typed wrappers for specific methods (JS pinvoke, basically) that correctly and efficiently use this new icall under the hood. Later on those wrappers could transition to using dedicated JS and bypassing the icall machinery if necessary."

"I'm not yet familiar with the regex handoffs between TS and ripgrep—would ripgrep have to support the same case change operations, or is TS performing the replacement and ripgrep is more of a file buffer, match-only iterator?

A String.replace() replacer() function defeats the internal parameter handling AFAICT, which means that the replacer has to walk the replacement pattern character at a time and replace the various $N instances. This isn't hugely challenging but it's very reinvent-the-wheel-y and duplicates a lot of the work and logic I see in `.../replacePattern.ts`.

So while I agree the second sounds easier, it also feels like it's fairly significantly increasing the difference between these fundamentally identical code paths. The current codepath is already applying the regex twice, once into `_regExp` and once with he `text.replace()`es.

Moving the vs/editor/contrib/find logic to vs/base/common might be the best use of time, even if it delays the case ops support. Just IMHO, still very much a noob to this codebase."

I have tested the multiplication on x64 and power. The program works fine on x64 and does not work on power Below are the console and generated IL codes for both plaforms along with the small test program. The only thing which I can think of is, this is too hardware specific and while passing '0x0000271000000001' int64 parameter as int32 parameter to mono_is_power_of_two function, power is somehow making it to power of 2 which is not happening on x64.

"While checking what's consuming space this week in the AppData directory, I by chance came across this directory, and immediately warning bells started ringing. Both due to the size of the data it contained, and the name. ""RemoteWorkspace? Is this another data-exfiltration attempt without my consent?!"" was my first thought. Only (!) by doing a google search and by pure luck finding this very github issue did I find out that it's _yet another_ directory to maintain (clean out) where VS stores ton of junk.

Previously users knew about the option to delete the "".vs"" directory (and not infrequently got told by ""support"" to do so), but now there's yet _another_ directory, with a for-all-intents-and-purposes encrypted name, effectively **hidden** (worse, **intentionally** hidden) that I'm quite sure support don't have any idea whatsoever it even exists.

Some of the following could be considered ranting, but frankly I don't care anymore what you think when you dump waste products all over **my** storage, without neither my permission nor even the curtesy of telling me, much less providing the functionality to remove the crap.

@github 
> > so who delete db file left out?

> No one. It's just a cache.

To quote a greater person than I am: ""You keep using that word. I don't think that word means what you think it means"".

> This is equiv to the data stored by many apps in the .appdata folder. It isn't intended to ever be touched our used by the user.

There's a helluva lot of difference between ""cache"" and ""Dumpingspace landfill we take the liberty to rip off from the users. Let's fill it with excrements and never clean it, then we call it a _cache_ and go MUAHAHAHAHA when the users diskspace is completely consumend so it can't even update neither VS nor Windows itself after a while!"".

I have only used this version for a few weeks and already this ""cache"" is over a quarter of a gigabyte. Extrapolate until the end of the year, and the system volume would have zero bytes free space. Guess how happy I am to find out this is _intentional_.

I'm really, REALLY sick and tired of VS stealing (!) storage from me from all over the bloody place, without my consent. Now you created a mess where most users won't even know about this landfill you erroneously call ""cache"". I know about it now, so I can redirect that crap directory at the filesystem level to a junk volume I have redirected much other VS crap to, but what about the tens of thousands (or however many there are) users that _don't_ know about this? Are you gonna pay out of your own pocket for the downtimes this creates when they have to *reformat* and *install from scratch* Windows, VS, and who knows what other software, just because you filled up the users system volume -- behind their back, hidden in an obscure location they according to you shall never clean -- with data you erroneously call ""cache""?

I appreciate the effort to clean up the mess that the code apprently is, but replacing that with messing up users filesystems in an even _worse_ way is IMO not an acceptable tradeoff.

This could be fixed with a VS-wide setting, with user-interface, allowing users to redirect (and move, and clean) this directory, but the way it's currently implemented my position is that this is malware.

To round off... please learn what ""cache"" actually means before using that word again."

"I'm of two minds here. 

I really like that you want to prevent the VT52 stuff from getting in the way or affecting the performance of the VT100 code. It's always nice to build something in a way that guarantees the other mechanism isn't going to be affected in any way.

However...

It's really not that big of a deal to change the `ActionEscDispatch` interface and method to have a parameter option if need be, it's not terrible to have a slightly diverging mode codepath in the `OutputStateMachineEngine` for this mode type, and I don't think there will be very much performance impact at all given the character parsing and twiddling of the VT engines tend to be a relatively small portion of CPU time when I've traced it in the past.

I'm a bit concerned that if we have two completely different implementations that it will be easier to completely forget about one when designing things around the other one and we'll be writing an exorbitant amount of boilerplate to do the 95% common things between the two of them.

* for something like `mp -t 0`, the long form could actually just be `--tab` 🤔 
* `mp -t 0 left` now is a little weird, ""move the pane to tab 0 (to the left???)"" That doesn't make sense. The two options (`direction` and `--tab`) would have to be exclusive
* It's probably not _that_ insane to have two actions (`MovePane` and `MovePaneToTab`) that are exposed through a single commandline interface.

"Well, so this _works_, but it has 2 problems:

1. Most consumers do not expect the very specific type the jsx factory function actually returns. Usually, this manifests in reassignments, where
```ts
let a = <div></div>;
a = <img />;
```
ends up being an error because rather than both being `JSX.Element`, the first assignment makes `a` a `React.ReactElement<HTMLDivElement>`, while the second line is a `React.ReactElement<HTMLImageElement>`. This is, unfortunately, a breaking change we'd force on people. It's not hard to fix (annotate `a` with the more vague `JSX.Element` yourself), but could be frustrating. That break reduces the appetite to take this change a bit.

2. Performance is _terrible_. Like beyond bad. This makes _every_ jsx tag tree in your program into a series of nested generic context sensitive function calls (and _most_ jsx apps have a _lot_ of nested tags!). That's just about the worst-case scenario for the type checker. If we could make nested context sensitive function calls much more performant to check, it's go a long way towards making merging this feasible."

Long term I think that terrapin will end up encompassing all of the tools in our build that contribute to how our DLL files are written.

The vast majority (probably nearly all) of cases where we use ImmutableDict, it's not to benefit from what ID is decent at, but just to ensure it will not be mutated post creation.

For example, here's an easy sort of problem i can envision, which i'd like an undertanding of how it is handled:

1. on the client (without roslyn), user makes some edits.  this increases the length of the file.
2. client then wants to classify the text at the end of the file.
3. tehy then communicate with server, but server doesn't have text/project that matches what client has.  server passes requests onto roslyn, which crashes because invariant is broken.

Now, given this is such a simple scenario, and you're likkely not crashing.  You have presumably solved this in some manner.  For example, some sort of syncing.  Or perhaps validating that the request can even be asked on the other end.  However, those designs and invariants are not clear here, and as such it makes it *very* hard to tell if the code here is correct.

There were all sorts of assumptions and terrible practices going on between the clients and the servers, and at the end of the day, it became necessary for tons of hacks to be added all over the place to just paper over these places where little discussion/design had happened, and people jsut did random stuff because it seemed to work without understanding the implications of those decisions.

I would *very very* much like to avoid that in roslyn.  For a very large part of it we've operated under the assumption that it's much better to have strict invariatns and to fail early to ensure that people ""do the right thing"".  If we're still abiding by that, that's great.  But if we're not, it's important to document so we cna ensure everyone's mental model of responsibilities is accurate.

Thanks!"

I agree this is very likely not the only one, it's just one that keeps popping up quite often. It's been a pain point for years (first on WPF, then on UWP, now on both MAUI and WinUI 3, etc.), and something that has received countless feature requests for. The solution many have come up with is to just roll their own collection types with support for ""range operations"", with the big drawback being though that since no UI framework among these actually supports the API, they're just forced to either iterate over items one by one (which is just terrible for performance), or just reset the collection and reinitialize it (which is also bad for performance, maybe just a little bit less, and also completely breaks all animations). It's just a very unfortunate situation where customers get frustrated, and they often have to both do extra work to build these helpers, and then still end up with a suboptimal experience. I mean, we have the same exact custom collection type in the Microsoft Store too, and it has the same exact issues (and I hate it). It's just a really common issue, and I'm saying I'd love for us to find the time to coordinate with the right folks and maybe try to finally get this resolved at least for .NET 8 🙂

I've also received multiple requests to add such a custom collection type in the .NET Community Toolkit, and I've had to reject them for the reasons mentioned above (it still results in a very bad experience, and I'd much rather just fix this properly in the BCL). The net result though is that at least for now, the API is not there and plenty of folks are frustrated.

> ""but my recollection is that it broke in a substantial way as soon as runtime merged this change originally.""

I find that surprising and I'd love to learn more about that. Even with the new APIs, as long as nobody actually calls them, there should be no functional differences in the way the currently existing APIs work at all. So I'm not sure I understand what broke. Are you sure it wasn't just folks trying out the _new_ APIs, and then reporting WPF crashing/breaking in that scenario? 🤔

> ""Would doing that be a less disruptive way for newer frameworks to get range support?""

I personally don't think that'd be the correct solution for this issue, for a number of reasons:

- The core issue is that right now, the various UI frameworks don't support multiple collection updates. Where they come from is not what's causing the issue. That is, even with a new collection type, you'd get the same exact crashes until the frameworks were updated to handle the args. And if they were updated, then there would be no reason to have a separate collection type in the first place, as it'd just be the same exact one but with two new APIs. Those should just be added on what we have.
- It'd make updating codebases much more tedious, as now you'd have to swap the whole collection type in all locations rather than just being able to opt-in into a range update whenever necessary.
- I'd argue it'd be an abstraction leak. You want an observable collection, the fact that some callsites would need to perform range operations on that is just an implementation detail of your viewmodels. You shouldn't need to use a completely different collection type just to support this.

I would really love for us to just manage to coordinate across the various teams and officially add support for this in a future release, not sooner than .NET 8 at this point. We could both update all underlying frameworks to support this (which I realize is non trivial work, especially since eg. WinUI 3 would likely need some new WinRT APIs and projections for this), and then provide the necessary migration docs, if needed. I believe this would be the best long term solution for this issue 🙂"
"I initially went along with this, but when usability testing it locally I remembered why I had done it this way in the first place.

Basically I'm using exceptions to show the users their error messages, so it really ought to be more user friendly then your actual problem being buried in amongst an Aggregate exception format and a bunch of stack-trace stuff. This all stems from me using exceptions to bail out of functions early when we find argument problems (url is null, doesn't exist) so I don't have to make every method return `Result<T>` where Result could have an error that should cause us to bail early or the value we actually asked for. If you can think of a better paradigm than using exceptions of that gross Result<T> stuff I'm on board, because I agree that using exceptions this way isn't great, it's just the best I could come up with."

I imagine that we will either have to...
1.

2. Make the DxRenderer load this HFONT into a GDI HDC and then call [IDWriteGdiInterop::CreateFontFaceFromHdc](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwritegdiinterop-createfontfacefromhdc) and use the resulting `IDWriteFontFace` normally.

I bet the second one is easier but is a little gross for using GDI inside the DX renderer. The first one is probably difficult because I think TTF/OTF always specifies fonts as vector outlines, so I'm not sure how we'd live-specify these. Probably a lot more math...

* In this case we find the match at line 30
* Then assume the user scrolls up and selects a text in line 15. Then the user clicks ""search previous""
* We  will select the match at line 20 (because our state suggests to move from `3/3` to `2/3`), though probably the user expected to get the match in line 10 (at least VSCode in this case selects line 10 and puts the state at `1/3`)."

- After initial PR being closed, the bot keeps sending PRs, effectly spamming the repos.

We have reviewed the changes in this PR. Most of the changed words are ""accidental gender pronouns"" - `he` as a prefix of `hello`, or `his` as a suffix of `this`, and both examples come from test cases where inline comments are used to split words (like `t/**/his`), and the PR wants to change them into `t/**/theirs` etc..

"> Many workloads for which tasks were originally introduced, actually. Consider, for example, parallelized divide and conquer. A worker partitions its work into multiple pieces, queues identical workers to process N - 1 of those pieces, processes its own, and then waits for those other workers to complete. Also think about algorithms that require coordination between those pieces, such as various operations used by PLINQ (e.g. OrderBy) that needs to block each of the workers until they reach a common point so that they can exchange data and all continue on, and what would happen if one of the workers was throttled indefinitely

Today do the implementation of those kick end up doing Task.Wait?

> I think that's the wrong direction, at least for the foreseeable future. If we decided to go with an approach like the one proposed in this draft, I have trouble seeing it as anything other than opt-in, given all of the previously cited concerns, the potential for introducing deadlocks where they weren't previously, the potential for casting way too wide a net, the potential for negatively impacting the throughput of unrelated workloads, etc. _If such a mitigation was added as opt-in, and if enough testing demonstrated it was a good decision for certain workloads, then it could potentially be automatically opted-in for those, e.g. if you felt ASP.NET should always turn this on. Even there, though, I'd be surprised if in the current configuration that was a wise choice.

Yes I have similar fears but I'm looking for solutions. Maybe this isn't this one but there are aspects of this that seem interesting. Say we added a public API to enable this and it was opt-in, I could see the potential for adding a piece of middleware or filters that enables this on the current workitem before the blocking code executed. Something like this:

```C#
[HttpGet(""/blocking"")]
[EnableBlockingMitigation] // This name is terrible
public string BlockingLegacyCodez()
{
      return new WebClient().DownloadString(...); // I know we're never supposed to use this API
}
```

That filter could yield to thread pool to get off the current work item and enable mitigation on a unique workitem that's closer to this code. The equivalent of doing this:

```C#
[HttpGet(""/blocking"")]
public async Task<string> BlockingLegacyCodez()
{
      await Task.Yield(); // Make a new work item
      ThreadPool.EnableBlockingWorkitem();
      return new WebClient().DownloadString(...); // I know we're never supposed to use this API
}
```

The alternative IMO is to choose (or combine) one of the ReplacePattern implementations, move it to vs/base/common/search.ts (or perhaps .../replace.ts) and tweak the small handful of callers.

 @github I'm good with removing `marked.sanitize`. The setting is deprecated and has known issues, which is why we added `insane`.

My concern is just that allowing CSS brings up a number of other considerations:

- Which css rules do we allow? Do we try sanitizing the css? If we do have a whitelist of allowed css, how do we handle feature requests to support additional properties?

- Do we want extensions to control the styling insides hovers at all? Right now we control the presentation and can try our best to make sure the hovers look ok with all themes 

- Enabling css expands the potential attack surface. If someone finds an exploit in Chromium related to CSS, it could potentially now effect VS Code too.

That is how I am thinking of this feature. There are cases where the compiler can definitely determine if the user is doing something wrong, but also where it _might_ be doing something wrong. The [`Span<T>.ToArray()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.span-1.toarray) is another example. If a user calls `ToArray()` and `T` is known to be ByRefLike, the compiler could issue a failure. However, if `T` isn't know at compile time then it would be up to the implementer to have handled this appropriately using something like the proposed intrinsi-fication of `typeof(T.).IsByRefLike` in this document. The updated `Span<T>.ToArray()` would look as follows and handle the case at runtime. The other APIs in question would have similar checks.

Next steps: update the workload manifest to use all these new nugets.  Figure out some way to test this.

No, only when we find a reliable mechanism to detect LLC or switch to something else to calculate Gen0 size. Till then we should not trust whatever API gives us or we might stuck with 256Kb Last-Level-Cache on a 30 core machine and hit a terrible penalty on GC-intensive workloads.

Small/Destkop class hardware should not be hurt with this intrinsic, for e.g. 8 cores it picks 1Mb cache (leading to 1.8Mb gen0 size) and for single/dual-cores it's around 480Kb for Gen0."
"Yes, though it took me a while to walk through this all (it's unpleasant that there's no grammar we can just look at at this point).  

Here's the chain of productions through which we can see the 'GeneratorParameter' being passed down:

```
GeneratorDeclaration[Yield, Default] :
  function * BindingIdentifier[?Yield] ( FormalParameters[Yield,GeneratorParameter] ) { GeneratorBody[Yield] }
  ... elided ...

// FormalParameters[yield,generateparameter] leads to:
FormalParameter[Yield,GeneratorParameter] :
  BindingElement[?Yield, ?GeneratorParameter]

BindingElement[Yield, GeneratorParameter ] : See 13.2.3
  ... elided ...
  [+GeneratorParameter] BindingPattern[?Yield,GeneratorParameter] Initializer[In]opt

BindingPattern[Yield,GeneratorParameter] :
  ObjectBindingPattern[?Yield,?GeneratorParameter]
  ... elided ...

ObjectBindingPattern[Yield,GeneratorParameter] :
  ... elided ...
  { BindingPropertyList[?Yield,?GeneratorParameter] }

BindingPropertyList[Yield,GeneratorParameter] :
  BindingProperty[?Yield, ?GeneratorParameter]
  ... elided ...

BindingProperty[Yield,GeneratorParameter] :
  ... elided ...
  PropertyName[?Yield, ?GeneratorParameter] : BindingElement[?Yield, ?GeneratorParameter]

PropertyName[Yield,GeneratorParameter] :
   LiteralPropertyName
   [+GeneratorParameter] ComputedPropertyName
   [~GeneratorParameter] ComputedPropertyName[?Yield]
```

So, if you have:

```
function * foo({ [x] : ..., [y] : ... }) {
}
```

Then 'generator parameter' is used ot indicate you're creating the parameters for hte generator.  And eventually that flag bubbles down to when you're doing the computed properties.  And, within those computed properties, yield is apparently disabled.  Meaning you can't use a yield expression inside a computed property name (which is not a terrible thing IMO).

(Hopefully i'm reading that right).

Now, oddly enough, outside of a generator parameter, i think it would be legal to use 'yield'.  so if you had:

```
function * f() {
   var v = { [yield 1] : 1 }
}
```

Then that would be fine.  'generator-parameter' is the context flag that enables us to flag this down.

"> I don't like it. I think we should not do this if we can't move the whole feature over (analyzer and diagnostic). I worry that we'll just end up with crap left behind that we never get to. But not moving this at all, it highly motivates solving this in an appropriate manner.

From an end-user perspective, this will make no difference at all. They just need the analyzer on CI, and code fix in IDE (regardless of whether it is invoked from a NuGet package or from an implementation in IDE). My point is, do we think it is worth blocking a user feature (CI enforcement) on just the fact that we'd like to cleanup and port the fixer to NuGet package?"
"> We are making the string marshaller types public, so the innovation that can be applied to them will be fairly limited.

Ugh. Well crap... this does change my perspective. I agree reconciling all of them would be a win. I will say the new entry points do seem to clutter the implementation and make something that is nicely standalone and easy to reason about more complicated. I guess I'm going to have to review this in detail. I think this is worth exploring."
"I spent some time yesterday looking through the implementations of ReplacePattern in vs/editor/contrib/find/replacePattern.ts and vs/workbench/services/search/common/replace.ts. Each of these implements different mechanisms for the CharCode `switch`es, so a small CharCode-aware-only helper function doesn't seem viable.

The alternative IMO is to choose (or combine) one of the ReplacePattern implementations, move it to vs/base/common/search.ts (or perhaps .../replace.ts) and tweak the small handful of callers.

I'm probably not the best choice to perform a nuanced refactor since I'm a TS noob; however I can likely implement the replacement change in .../replace.ts as a parallel to .../replacePattern.ts.

Note, the old Begin/EndAccept methods support doing an accept and receive in a single operation. Unfortunately the API for this is terrible and forces allocation. It's also not currently supported on non-Windows platforms. So, replace this with a helper routine that performs an accept followed by a receive, and works across all platforms.

"Yeah, I'm not a fan of any of these extension methods that all take lambdas that call each other. I only looked at cleaning up the solution provider ones, but I can have a pass at the rest.

"Are there any custom triggers being used to represent other types of triggering, or is it really being used as ""here's a way to pass ambient state along for the ride""? I recognize this might churn stuff, but it very much feels like this CustomTags exists on trigger just because it was the convenient type that happens to be there.

Three interesting, potentially controversial, and likely terrible ideas came to mind while writing that previous sentence:
1. I think you already had some sort of ""context"" object that was beginning to congeal. Perhaps a type that is the ""context"" that contains the trigger, various ""environment"" flags (notably this debugger flag and the interactive flag), and maybe some other pieces of information could become the replacement.
2. Is the debugger flag only being used to control whether we list completion items before their declaration point? And do completion providers get passed an OptionSet from the originating workspace (or can get at it)? If both are ""yes"", then _perhaps_ we should instead have there be a not-UI-exposed completion option that simply specifies that debugger behavior, and the debugger workspace we create just sets that option explicitly. I could _imagine_ people might actually like that behavior during real typing as well. It's not rare that you might write some code and realize you need to use a local declared farther down. Rather than me breaking context, moving the local up, and then writing the code again, that it's perhaps OK to actually complete it anyways. It's I am _not_ saying we should expose it in a UI (at least not until customers come with pitchforks asking for it :smile:), but if they did come along and ask for that we'd implement that with an option. Given that _also_ might fix this problem too, I can't help but notice the coincidence.
3. Rather than having some additional way to shuttle info, this could just be checking the workspace kind. It's still comparing magic strings, but at least without the baggage of extra types.

"If we allow `checkExpressionCached` to continue, the relevant symbol still ends up marked referenced via `checkExpressionCached` -> `checkIdentifier` -> `markAliasReferenced` -> `markAliasSymbolAsReferenced`. In other words, it's not only `markExportAsReferenced` that will end up marking it referenced.

So I think it's possible to alter `markExportAsReferenced` instead of `checkExportSpecifier`, though it may be a bit more awkward since `markExportAsReferenced` takes a couple different kinds of nodes.

And then we do still need to handle the other code path too. For that, nothing stands out as a great option. It feels like an `export type` ancestor check is possible, and similar to other checks that `markAliasReferenced` does already for example (`isInTypeQuery`), but depending on where we try to check, it could be an arbitrarily long ancestor walk.

I guess the choice I'm leaning towards for this other code path would be a check in `checkIdentifier` for the `node.parent.parent.parent` being a type only export declaration. This would be similar to the check for a property access expression and would go around the call to `markAliasReferenced`. Feels a bit gross, but we can know the exact ancestor to try to check from here."

"> I guess if it was OK for BindableLayout, it should be OK for Map too?

Either that, or we made a terrible mistake merging 5582. That implementation of Replace in `Apply` is very suspect.

It looks like Map.Pins is an `ObservableCollection<Pin>`, so while I don't like this implementation of `Apply`, it should be fine for this purpose. It looks like the implementation of `ObservableCollection` only uses `NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Replace` for a single item being set. So at least for this specific application, it shouldn't cause any immediate problems.

"Possibly this is an example of me trying to outsmart the compiler and in the end doing something stupid 😄 Was trying to achieve inlining this method in its usages, given that it's just a simple expression, to avoid unnecessary calls to this method.

"As a side note, the reason fixing this is important even given the obvious uselessness of the construct `const {} = anything` is that we ought to be able to deliver accurate completions inside the `{}`.

> Also how do you feel about passing in an ILogger \ ILoggerFactory instead to the ctor? This feels a little gross. This feels a little gross.

I did this because we already take a `serviceProvider`, so why complicate things for the consumer? Under what circumstances would someone have reason to supply a different `ILogger` than the one the service provider would offer? I'm not absolutely set against it, but would like to make a choice based on practical reasoning.

In the long term, we may need to consume other services too. If we keep adding them as extra constructor overloads one-by-one, it will not be a nice experience for consumers."
