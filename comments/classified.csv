I could _imagine_ people might actually like that behavior during real typing as well. It's not rare that you might write some code and realize you need to use a local declared farther down. Rather than me breaking context, moving the local up, and then writing the code again, that it's perhaps OK to actually complete it anyways. It's I am _not_ saying we should expose it in a UI (at least not until customers come with pitchforks asking for it :smile:), but if they did come along and ask for that we'd implement that with an option. Given that _also_ might fix this problem too, I can't help but notice the coincidence",0,0.5

It's been a pain point for years (first on WPF, then on UWP, now on both MAUI and WinUI 3, etc.), and something that has received countless feature requests for. The solution many have come up with is to just roll their own collection types with support for ""range operations"", with the big drawback being though that since no UI framework among these actually supports the API, they're just forced to either iterate over items one by one (which is just terrible for performance), or just reset the collection and reinitialize it (which is also bad for performance, maybe just a little bit less, and also completely breaks all animations). It's just a very unfortunate situation where customers get frustrated, and they often have to both do extra work to build these helpers, and then still end up with a suboptimal experience. I mean, we have the same exact custom collection type in the Microsoft Store too, and it has the same exact issues (and I hate it).

I could imagine people might actually like that behavior during real typing as well. It's not rare that you might write some code and realize you need to use a local declared farther down. Rather than me breaking context, moving the local up, and then writing the code again, that it's perhaps OK to actually complete it anyways. It's I am not saying we should expose it in a UI (at least not until customers come with pitchforks asking for it :smile:), but if they did come along and ask for that we'd implement that with an option.

Again this is always guaranteed to be a valid type cast due to how the messenger itself works - each recipient will always match the original #code constraint in each delegate being invoked.

The #code method takes string arguments so it is theoretically infinite there and works properly. So why have that as just a method? Why not turn that into a constructor? Isn't that just stupid to not have it as a constructor if it literally satisfies what BigInt is supposed to be when as it currently stands does not? You already have all of the code for the #code method so why not just use it? Just copy + paste, anyone can do this!

"The check done on the epoll thread is speculative. The value that is checked is updated under the lock, and since the epoll thread does not take the lock the value read may be incorrect. It is very unlikely to happen because a wait of any sort would typically involve a memory barrier (often even if it does not actually end up waiting), and the value read would be at least as recent as when the epoll wait was released. Even if the wait did not block, it is possible that (if it doesn't involve a memory barrier directly) the call sequence involved would involve a memory barrier of some sort. Nevermind the estimations on memory barriers, the fact is that at worst we are relying on the latency of processor cache consistency here, and how bad that can be depends entirely on the processor. Some old (especially arm) processors don't have any sort of cache consistency and they rely entirely on software to do the right thing. When a processor has cache consistency the whole idea is that it shouldn't take an inordinate amount of time to make caches consistent, otherwise it would defeat the purpose. For example, using #code to exit a lock relies entirely on processor cache consistency latency for it to work reasonably well. My stance remains that considering that the alternative is not functionally incorrect, this should be good enough for the purpose. That is up for debate though, we can sacrifice some perf to guarantee that sync operations are signaled on the epoll thread",0,0.5

@github  can i just remove all these,0,0.5
@github  can you confirm i didn't screw the rebase ? :),0,0.5
@github  do we still need this? don't think so right,0,0.5
@github  I agree that the worst case looks bad -- but it is extremely unlikely,1,0.5

@github - what a nasty user :blush: I believe that the problem you describe exists in the original code as well,0,0.5
@github @github  does #code meet all these criteria? Also could this change be in a separate PR,0,0.5
@github @github @github Is the upgrade deps tool putting the wrong values here,0,0.5
@github @github AH okay thank you both for the explanations! I will get right on this :),0,0.5
@github @github are we really pushing this to Nuget? Or is this to an internal pipelines feed,0,0.5
@github @github do you have any suggestions about how this could be solved (or worked around),0,0.5
@github @github In this PR I am trying to move #code from #code to #code. I got stuck with the following issue,0,0.5
@github @github Is the stream context completing the transport output like this a terrible hack or an elegant solution? IDK 🤷,1,0.5
@github / @github what do you think? I lean towards the mlaunch version (although the downside here is that there can be multiple mlaunch versions for the same maccore hash),0,0.5
@github #url is the tool I use. It is incredibly useful in validating these little things,0,0.5
@github can you look over the failures in #url and see if anything comes to mind,0,0.5
@github can you review this one,0,0.5
@github changes look good. Interestingly all the ignored enums and functions are in all platforms supported by the framework. There is an option to create a single ignore file that uses common-* as the prefix rather than the platform name. Food for though 😉,0,0.5
@github could this be something as stupid as not giving mlaunch enough time to finish,1,0.5
@github could you elaborate on why the Arm64 implementation can't basically be a 1-to-1 port of the x86/x64 logic,0,0.5
@github could you please explain what you mean by,0,0.5
@github do you think we should start putting a short comment/description at the top of each new MSBuild file to explain what the file is,0,0.5

@github hmmm what does the semicolon in this path name do,0,0.5
@github how gross is this? Having this here avoids a second dictionary lookup per page invocation,1,0.5

@github it should always be better when the array will have to store 4 or less items.  This is for two reasons,0,0.5
@github likes it in the behind,1,0.5
@github looks like this bit is using spaces rather than tabs. I think @github likes to keep the formatting similar to the sourounding code,0,0.5
@github maybe just an if statement inside that makes those changes ~ adds watch to the legacy and doesn't go though the platforms for the dotnet_iOS_MacCatalyst,0,0.5
@github Not sure how to tell the difference. Probably both,0,0.5

@github So I just tried to apply the mac attributes to this one and a few of them below that say they are available for mac as well and they were getting a lot of compile errors,0,0.5
@github that is a great question... Yeah this is the generated method signature,0,0.5
@github That worked. The only failing test now is the one I stated in #url,0,0.5
@github this failure,0,0.5
@github this is testing the old DesignTime build which should still be used on Mac/Linux. So we need to make sure we disable the new stuff. Remember we have to pass in #code for the unit tests to get round that compiler issue,0,0.5
@github this is what @github was asking you for me about! wondering what a better way of doing this might be,0,0.5
@github This local variable will be released in the end of method with the help of garbage collector,0,0.5
@github this really sucks,1,0.5
@github Those are the default settings for insane (just copied over so I could add a few more attributes). The allowed tags are separate from the allowed attributes. The current setting just says: if we allow iframes (which we don't) here are the allowed attributes for them. We can remove the line since it has no effect,0,0.5
@github told me blazor already has this type of theming via bootstrap styles,0,0.5
@github we have a typo here,0,0.5
@github Well I made a boo boo.  I had to remove my fork because I was stupid and didnt create a branch on this defect but wanted to work another one.  Was planning on only doing one and well one thing led to another :),0,0.5
@github what do you think,0,0.5
@github What do you think,0,0.5
@github why did we need to change the order? Is the order important,0,0.5
@github Will that still work for localization,0,0.5
@github will try again... did you change the background color though? I wonder if that's related,0,0.5
@github would that require any changes in Mono that we have to wait for? Or is that already implemented,0,0.5
@github would you consider changing the max zoom level to 8? It was a terrible experience as I mentioned #119890,0,0.5
@github yes definitely! so this PR does both of those things! It both: 1. Ensures font scaling will automatically be enabled across all the platforms including iOS 2. Introduces a #code boolean property that can be set to #code if so desired,0,0.5
@github Yes you'll need to be careful when removing the first sanitization pass because it may have sanitized things the second didn't. This should be unlikely,0,0.5
@github you can pick any method from the jit-diff and I'll explain with the diffs what exactly happened,0,0.5

I have similar fears about #code: what happens if the same #code command is executed multiple times,0,0.5
I have tested the multiplication on x64 and power.,0,0.5
I have this idea that #code probably isn't the ideal inner-type here either and we'll want to drop in a #code as soon as @github works out the kinks in #8787 on how to set up the templates to accept allocators as these are a great place to use a memory pool from my perf traces,0,0.5
I have to agree with @github. Something like -xf-visualelement-scale is completely undiscoverable and would limit the APIs use to industry experts. This needs to be stupid simple to figure out. Property names that make sense like -xf-scale achieve that,0,0.5

I should add a section at the end though clarifying that the intent here is for this to envolve though,0,0.5
I should really put that somewhere more memorable than in a commit message but aint nobody got time for that,0,0.5
I spoke with jonp about that. I think we should pick up any directBootAware. That means it will be forward compatible if google decide to add a new one. That said I need to also check the app element itself as well. I'll fix that up today,0,0.5

I think this was done this way so we DONT create a directory if the assembly does not contain any of the embedded resource types.  But I'd have to go back and look at the history to figure out what the original intent was.. its probably a cut and paste thing,0,0.5
I think we can just make the change and make an announcement about it if we deeply care about it,0,0.5
I think we do need the #code setting: #url,0,0.5
I think we need input from @github as to what the expected behaviour is in this instance,0,0.5
I think we need to get our shader story in a better place before we take on too many more of these :smile,0,0.5
I think we need to make this a LogCodedWarning if possible,0,0.5

I think we should come up with a better version than 1.0.0,0,0.5
I think we used byte[] (even though it's mutable) to avoid that,0,0.5
I think we'll hold off on adding a custom marshaller then until we get feedback that there's APIs that don't work correctly with the new ordering,0,0.5
I think you should go another route,0,0.5
I think you should seriously consider this -- eg the loop and its clone may have common hoistables,0,0.5

I'd disagree here: I think there's a beauty to the test classes being self contained. Otherwise we end up with insane inheritance hierarchies that only make what the code is doing _less_ clear. Duplicated code isn't bad; complexity is,0,0.5

I'm actually very opposed to that for the reason that comments invariably become desynced from code organization.   regions are part of the code and it is immediately visible when a new field is placed into the wrong region,0,0.5

I'm not opposed to this change as this improves build time and also the confusion around what should I use when I have a single target framework in a project within the dotnet/runtime repository. The only concern that I have is that the only validation to avoid usage of these properties will be either a wrong compilation (which might drive people nuts to not understand why the right code is not compiled) or PR Review... but I guess it is fine and people can get use to using #code,0,0.5
I'm not quite sure what's going on here. Can someone provide some context so we can all be on the same page? - @github,0,0.5

It appears that this hash code is being appended only when working with a default namespace. Which makes sense - keeping assemblies separate for different namespaces. The hash code is meant to be a predictable and persistent way to keep namespaces separated without having to append an entire namespace string in the assembly name which could be ugly at best and could run into more impactful issues at worst,0,0.5

It's OK to acknowledge that StringValues will rarely contain null array entries and not take the situation too seriously. I'm more concerned about the implementation having misleading #code overrides in it.
