Is the #code here the rootView or the contained views?,0,1
@github yes definitely! so this PR does both of those things! It both: 1. Ensures font scaling will automatically be enabled across all the platforms including iOS 2. Introduces a #code boolean property that can be set to #code if so desired,0,1
still seeing similar issues where hovering changes the color,0,1
"@github I agree that with this calculator sample specifically, gray might work better with the general color scheme. Unfortunately, the proposed colors aren't accessible so I think it would be best to keep the current colors which have already been tested and validated for accessibility via our templates. Naturally, different colors might look better with different samples and scenarios, and folks can always change these styles as they wish. If you want to use grays for the calculator sample, I recommend a light gray button on black background in dark mode!

we should ask @github if this is the right thing to do cos I have no idea :D,0,1
@github I think we will need this on 16.7 I just did some tests on Windows with accented paths and files like #code no longer work correctly. We get the following error,0,1
"For some reason it is also missing the xml declaration at the top that might be related, but I'm not sure.",0,1
@github I'm not sure why I've had to add this to this particular test. It was failing without it.,0,1
@github I tested this branch in VSCode on Mac OS. I can still debug the MSBuild Task tests so this looks good to me :),0,1
This might also be useful for customers who want to profile their app I guess.,0,1
"But I do wonder if there is a way we can enable this at built time somehow, so generate the java code which adds the Intent .",0,1
I think this was done this way so we DONT create a directory if the assembly does not contain any of the embedded resource types.  But I'd have to go back and look at the history to figure out what the original intent was.. its probably a cut and paste thing,0,1
@github I think it's working now.,0,1
"So we'll have to merge monodroid (it will be broken temporarily), and then come back to this?",0,1
Correct.,0,1
so we are always adding this jar file? Is that going to impact any project which dont need it?,0,1
@github this is testing the old DesignTime build which should still be used on Mac/Linux. So we need to make sure we disable the new stuff. Remember we have to pass in #code for the unit tests to get round that compiler issue.,0,1
Those lock tests are not failing :/,0,1
We have 1 nuget failure #code,0,1
"And the windows build , I can't see why that failed 🤷‍♂",0,1
I would go with #code now that I think about it. Since it will match the case of #code.,0,1
"@github found a slight hiccup with this, C# bindings often required #code. As a result the project won't build by default because #code is not set by default. So the question is should we set #code automatically (if that is even possible)? Other options are rethink about the default for the #code attribute, or just allow the project to fail and let the user set #code manually.",0,1
Should we also change this to throw an exception for older API levels?,0,1
https://github.com/xamarin/androidtools/blob/b639c1ee85191193453b0bf436e816619737a2d9/Xamarin.AndroidTools/Devices/AndroidDeviceExtensions.cs#L63-L69,0,1
"We don't even support anything less than API 19 now. So I'm not sure that fallback is even needed anymore, we should remove it and the #code statement as well I think.",0,1
@github @github are we really pushing this to Nuget? Or is this to an internal pipelines feed?,0,1
Should we include the RuntimeIdentifier in the Intermediate Path? Or will that just confuse things ?,0,1
I'll see about adding the SmokeTest run of MSBuildDeviceIntegration to the windows smoke test run,0,1
Does this file need to be added to #code ? It will be deleted on the next build otherwise.,0,1
same here,0,1
This one is done,0,1
https://github.com/dellis1972/xamarin-android/blob/37f5ce86b359324752fc5375e360304c6a545572/src/monodroid/jni/monodroid-glue.c#L655,0,1

"should we care about the order of the #code here. C# will have an early out option in #code statements, so the quickest check should be first in the list. We should probably try to remember that when reviewing code from here on :)",0,1
"My guess is the BinarySearch will be faster than the #code call, correct?",0,1
TPN? not sure what that is an acronym for?,0,1
Should be fixed in https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid/pull/990,0,1
So we have a few options.,0,1
"1. a hard break , users need to switch to the new defines for net5. (not desirable I think).",0,1
2. define the old #code prefixed ones in net5..,0,1
"3. define the new non prefixed ones in our product now as well as the old, but issue warnings the old are deprecated (if possible) to allow users to migrate. We can then phase our the old style.",0,1
Personally I would prefer option 3.,0,1
The failing test does not seem to be an issue caused directly by this PR.,0,1
Further investigation reviled an existing issue with incremental builds when using #code AOT.,0,1
Because #code AOT calls the #code task during the #code target it updates the assembly. The next build after than WILL cause #code to run because the #code are newer than the #code files.,0,1
While #code doesn't run in that scenario (and does with this new code). I believe we should try to alter the code so that #code does NOT cause the next build to do work it doesn't not need to. So that should be fixed in a separate PR.,0,1
I've changed this over to use #code,0,1
don't use log. here. it will lock up the UI thread (if someone decides to build in the UI).,0,1
"You should add a reference to the Xamarin.AsyncTask Nuget, and derive from that. Then use the LogMessage overloaded methods to log any data. It will marshal stuff back to the UI thread correctly",0,1
Do we even need this since its not depending on #code anymore?,0,1
@github we have a typo here,0,1
#code vs #code,0,1
I think we need to make this a LogCodedWarning if possible,0,1
@github why did we need to change the order? Is the order important?,0,1
I spoke with jonp about that. I think we should pick up any directBootAware. That means it will be forward compatible if google decide to add a new one. That said I need to also check the app element itself as well. I'll fix that up today.,0,1
LibZipSharp has been setup to use #code see https://github.com/xamarin/LibZipSharp/blob/master/Native.cs#L414,0,1
So it has to be in that directory. What other files do we have in x64?,0,1
interesting trick :),0,1
Should we remove this? What happens if we get an error which we are not expecting? This would then bubble up to MSBuild and give a horrible MSxxxx error. Should we keep a generic error here which asked users to report the issue ?,0,1
"I did try, but shared projects do not seem to like the way we include stuff like the Linker code and the pdb stuff etc. It seems they don't like the items where we define a property for the path e.g.#code.  I will have another go..",0,1
"It might be worth splitting those items into a separate .targets file, since we never edit them anyway",0,1
It works :D,0,1
not tempted to make this an SDK style project :P,0,1
erring out with a non actionable error is probably not the best. Let's leave this as it is.,0,1
"again, this is based on the customer template. I'll remove this.",0,1
"I guess because #code was ok with the old #code, but the new #code is not. It reports them as invalid.",0,1
I suspect google changed it at some point. not sure when. The old style does not even appear in the docs,0,1
[1] https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/permission-tree-element,0,1
"If we do, we should change all of them.",0,1
@github I took care of this on https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/754/files#diff-75caddb49a406bd996417c64cc1c00b1R275,0,1
I *think* (and @github can correct me :) ) we tend to prefer that we explicitly define the dependencies in,0,1
#code for .NET and #code for Legacy. We can do this in addition to #code but it does help when figuring out the build order if we have it in the other files too.,0,1
This is for .NET 7+ only right?,0,1
Also it makes it compatible with linux as well as that will look in #code by default (if it exists),0,1
is there a way to conditionally import this I wonder. So only if #code.,0,1
can we add some inputs and outputs on this :),0,1
Order was not important. I just decided to put all the unit test adapters at the bottom.,0,1
"@github this code path is only used for #code, #code and #code entries which are normally included in one of the Support Libraries. So we might have an attribute like",0,1
Now I'm not sure if there are any of our support libraries which do use that but if there are and #code is blank we might have a problem with the build later. We should probably add a unit test to make sure this works and/or raises a decent error message if #code is blank and we hit one of these.,0,1
should this value be true?,0,1
Do we want to use Linq here? We usually try to avoid it for performance reasons.,0,1
"I think we do, because we want to skip the code underneath if we already added a file of the same name.",0,1
"@github It takes a while for the latest release to get on to DevOps (assuming you are using the system installed XA on DevOps). As they have to update the image, tests it etc.",0,1
Perhaps it might be better to use a tool like [boots](https://github.com/jonathanpeppers/boots) to install the specific version you want?,0,1
:+1 for #code,0,1
"We already had a concept of #code but did't have the same for assets. I figured this would be an easy win, especially if you have large assets (like movie files).",0,1
Should we be using the #code stuff we have in https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/master/build-tools/Xamarin.Android.Tools.BootstrapTasks/Xamarin.Android.Tools.BootstrapTasks/Adb.cs#L217. Or are we sure we won't get any output after the #code call has completed?,0,1
@github is #code the right thing we need here?,0,1
Could we introduce an extension method which provides a #code extension. We could then remove a number of these #code blocks in the code.,0,1
have you sen all the translations use #code not #code ?,0,1
We tend to allow users to override the exe name from MSBuild e.g #code and them combine them in tool tasks like so,0,1
where #code will be the #code. We should probably follow the same pattern here for #code and #code,0,1
context see https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/commit/0ca2c216b04c67ca0b1b6cf5d34580a4b26adac2,0,1
"It has to do with how this works in XS. At some point the property was being reset even after it was set to 'true' so we could not rely on 'true' instead we needed to check for '' or 'false' . That commit should have included this file as well, but this was overlooked.",0,1
actually I'll leave it in. That way our build process will make sure it works :),0,1
"If its not actionable by the user, the #code might be better. #code has a cost since it will emit in any build except quiet. Where the LogDebug* works only for diagnostic builds (and bin logs)",0,1
"I don't think so, this takes place after #code and #code, if there is a problem with the xml it will have been caught earlier in the build.",0,1
"silly question, but does this need to be net6.0? or can it be netstandard2.1?",0,1
I think we need input from @github as to what the expected behaviour is in this instance.,0,1
Should we mention #code here? as its specific that that ItemGroup cannot contain those items.,0,1
Oh and all the unit tests are going to have to change as well. Most are hardcoded to look for #code most of the time.,0,1
Not 100% sure this won't break VS2012 since I'm not sure if that IDE can load v4.5.1 assemblies (afaik VS2012 was released before v4.5.1 was out... I'm happy to be wrong though :) ). It will need testing.,0,1
Are we missing this file? I can't see it in the PR,0,1
The fix above was merged,0,1
does this need to be High? It means we will always how this regardless of the verbosity set.  We should be using Log.LogDebugMessage instead? This would mean it only shows up in diagnostic builds.,0,1
"I did this to that it matches what was already there. I can rework this to use #code. Or perhaps we get this in, and then do a PR to remove ALL #code references?",0,1
"#code will also need MSBuild tests I think and MSBuildDevice. This folder contains the release/debug runtimes. I don't think the apk tests will test debug/fastdev at all, so we might not get good coverage just running those tests.",0,1
This was fixed in https://github.com/xamarin/android-sdk-installer/pull/452 so we can close this PR.,0,1
So we should emit both then? I'll take a look at doing that.,0,1
Hmm errors are,0,1
"yes something like #code or #code. That is was I was envisioned, so its all kinda self contained.",0,1
We should probably test this with #code = #code as well just to make sure we don't break anything in that mode too. Since some users do disable it.,0,1
should this be here or in DeviceTest?,0,1
https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/master/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Tests/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tests/Utilities/DeviceTest.cs#L19,0,1
Does this need to be conditionally imported?,0,1
"can I assume that #code doesn't care if you have duplicate entries? What does it do about conflicting ones? Could we get in to a situation where a User ha a custom config, which turns on optimisations, but we then turn it off again?",0,1
Ok Strong naming is needs to be added to,0,1
#code,0,1
can we name the bool parameter please :) #code,0,1
the iOS/Mac tooling does not allow this to be overridable. I suspect this is by design so NetStandard Facades are never included in the output.,0,1
Depends on https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/5926,0,1
"in the case of ""unknown option"" there will be only one error we are interested in.",0,1
otherwise we get an error for each line of the following.,0,1
For reference some performance differences https://gist.github.com/dellis1972/f5a9c9475dadea1331c6c62b1a478cd8 for .net 6,0,1
I thought part of the problem was that nodes are reused? Won't this stop that from happening?,0,1
@github I just realised these tests need a device right?,0,1
So they are in the wrong project. The should be in the #code project in #code where we have all the device based tests.,0,1
It should also make use of the #code property and #code the test if we don't have any devices attached.,0,1
For example https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/master/tests/MSBuildDeviceIntegration/Tests/InstallTests.cs#L233,0,1
I need to make changes to this anyway to make sure the new targets do not run as part of a DTB.,0,1
You can confirm this by looking at the Ids in the Rtxt file contents https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/3025/files#diff-8649defe4caffc0b9f604d92c1ad8808R78. These ids were generated by aapt2 on the same resource structure. I also included a test to make sure we produce the same results from the Rtxt as well.,0,1
This seems to work,0,1
So we might be able to setup a property which contains #code so its not all #code,0,1
nice :) I could have used this in #3938,0,1
"The #code target only calls build if we are running from the command line. In the IDE is does NOT call #code. Our tests run as if they are in the IDE, so a call to Build will be needed.",0,1
"Conceptually, #code + #code feels ""weird"": it's inconsistent with other existing properties, such as #code, #code.",0,1
Is there a reason to not go with #code (plural)? Is it easier for the IDE to have the two separate properties?,0,1
We have many MSBuild Properties which rely on an it being one or the other for example (and this is just a small example).,0,1
Also take a look at our current signing system. https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/main/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Xamarin.Android.Common.targets#L2287,0,1
This is pretty messy.,1,1
"This depends on if we are signing with ApkSigner or not. #code files MUST use ApkSigner, #code MUST not.",0,1
"Now I'm not saying that we don't need to rework this because its clear that we do. However, the approach in this PR seemed like the most straight forward given the time constraints for this feature. Tacking on the additional apk generation for this specific case i.e when the user is in release mode and are generating an #code.",0,1
"As we talked about on the meeting, we could just make #code internal. So not something users would use, but it would be automatic if they are using .net 6 AND #code And #code.",0,1
"I wonder how much larger it would be, though…. Could we make it work with an ""inner build""-like system?",0,1
"my concern with inner builds are performance, the fact that we (in .net 6) have to do an inner build for each abi already, adding yet another one for packaging/signing, then in the future more for Dynamic Features. I'd rather avoid those if possible. But it might well be our only option.",0,1
"So I guess the question really is, how quickly do we want this? Should we do it fast or right?",0,1
This looks good so far. I like how we still raise #code if the value is not an #code.,0,1
@github looks like this bit is using spaces rather than tabs. I think @github likes to keep the formatting similar to the sourounding code.,0,1
You got this,0,1
You so got this,0,1

Thanks for submitting this issue,0,1
Why not use #code?,0,1
I think we should come up with a better version than 1.0.0.,0,1
We could use the existing mlaunch version:,0,1
"or we could come up with something else (Xcode version? Something completely different that's calculated in maccore and doesn't take xamarin-macios into account? Go with ""0.0.1"" and decide something later?)",0,1
@spouliot / @dalexsoto what do you think? I lean towards the mlaunch version (although the downside here is that there can be multiple mlaunch versions for the same maccore hash).,0,1
Note for future: we can probably use #code and then exclude that category when running the tests.,0,1

Why #code (for the second argument)? You're not assigning anything to it.,0,1
"Same, #code output:",0,1
Then the [NoWatch] attribute on the other members added to this type is redundant.,0,1
"True, but that same argument apply to any generated code and optimization that are done. That includes the ones that are already present in that step: if you modify the generated Dispose then that code must be updated (or at least verified) to match.",0,1
"A test can be added to make failure more likely but still any generated code change must be reflected in all the optimizations, that's the contract for any code decorated with [BindingImpl].",0,1
"True, that's the contract. We're also humans who make mistakes... in theory we'd check that all optimizations continue to work as expected after changing BindingImpl methods, but experience tells me there's a significant chance that won't happen.",0,1
I might have missed something but I don't know why this would be limited to release builds ?,0,1
"You're right, I got confused.",0,1
"It's also only applied on types that are not subclassed. E.g. UIView would not be removed, even if empty, because a lot more logic would be needed to replace the calls (like UIWindow::Dispose back to its base class).",0,1
Removing an override is not a binary breaking change: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/,0,1
"Which means that if UIWindow::Dispose calls UIView::Dispose, and UIView::Dispose is removed, then the call will just go to the next Dispose implemenation further up the chain (which might end up being NSObject::Dispose).",0,1
"That said, I'm not sure if it would still work if it all happens within the same assembly.",0,1
On the other hand I'm wondering if a mix of two other ideas would make this idea more future-proof:,0,1
1. Enhance the optimization that removes the null assignment to remove the Handle == IntPtr.Zero check as well. This would mean the only thing left in the Dispose method would be the call to base.,0,1
2. Check if there is (or implement) an optimization in the linker (or our own custom steps) that removes virtual overrides that just call base.,0,1
"This seems both safer/more defensive, and generally more useful (the second part at least, if it's not done already).",0,1
"Another point is that this optimization will break if we ever change the dispose method to check for NativeHandle.Zero instead of IntPtr.Zero, and there are no tests in this PR to catch this :)",0,1
"Yes, the difference is that #code won't call any #code operators: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50811687/183422 (It's guaranteed to always be a pointer-comparison)",0,1

There are no functional changes,0,1
The 32 failed tests show that something functional changed.,0,1
"but if you really feel strong about this, I can revert the contents",0,1
"Yes, please.",0,1
Just that it's never going to be refactored after this,0,1
"If you want to refactor code, do it in a separate PR, and make it as clear as possible (PR description / commit message) that there should only be no functional changes.",0,1
It's always much easier to review two (or more!) small PRs than a single big one.,0,1

The .lastrun files are wiped out on a git clean so xliff-tasks complains about translations being out of date even when they aren't.,0,1

"Looking at the source for xliff-tasks, when they check if a translation is out of date, they actually compare the documents: https://github.com/dotnet/xliff-tasks/blob/cc53f75b404500236364694ff514dcdee2427a94/src/XliffTasks/Model/XlfDocument.cs#L68-L200, but something obviously goes wrong and then that function says that the translation should be updated when it wasn't (because when you run with #code no files are actually modified).",0,1

Stupid q - how does the implementation know to use the #code instance?,0,1
This only reinforces my belief that powershell is the best terrible scripting language we have.,1,1
will fix thsi up.  that line looks terrible.  sorry.,1,1
"Oh interesting. So you've got this implemented as ""in _structural_ order"" navigation. I suppose I imagined this as in ""in _id order_ navigation"".",0,1
So for example:,0,1
**EXAMPLE A:**,0,1
structural order: #code,0,1
**EXAMPLE B:**,0,1
structural order: #code,0,1
"Hmm. Maybe structural makes more sense. Cause in the case where we've got some panes that are opened and closed and opened, the ID order might be insane. Consider example B, close 3&4, then make a new vertical split (5), then close 2, then open a new split off 5 (6), then make a new split off 1 (7)",0,1
Now the structural order is: #code which makes way more sense than #code,0,1
WTF.  stupid autogenerated files.,1,1
"317 lines to 116, so like 33% but its much saner to make changes to now, it was insane how many copies of compiler flags there were before",0,1
"Sorry for this stupid mistake, changed",0,1
"https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/29571 will 100% break this (and we only held off merging it because we got spooked with the number of breaks already in 3.5 IIRC), since this is a terrible hack that makes #code ""look like any"" even though it's a type parameter and #code should be identical to #code or simply no constraint.",1,1
"Since the return type is MonoWasmEventPipeSessionID maybe it should be a cast to that. Also, if EventPipeSessionID becomes 64-bit later and the return value is somehow 32-bit, I think this would be a wrapping conversion which could cause a non-zero EventPipeSessionID to become 0? I guess that's what the assert is for but it feels gross to do the assert on something other than the actual return value, I would prefer to assert on the (post-cast) return value instead.",0,1
"The symbol is neither from source nor metadata? @github has convinced me this isn't insane, but I'm wondering if this needs to be doc'ed somewhere.",0,1
"Please do, this seems insane.",1,1
Stupid question: why do we know its not a literal? because it could be dynamic?,0,1
"The problem with ""IsMemberAccessExpressionName"" is then you need ""IsMemberAccessExpressionExpression"".  I think that reads terrible.  So instead i have ""IsNameOfMemberAccessExpression"" and ""IsExpressionOfMemberAccessExpression""",0,1
"Not sure this clarification helps or makes it worse; I think one of the benefits of generators is that developers do not have to manage generated files (e.g. register them for clean in the build, knowing where to put them, knowing how not fuck with the timestamps etc).",1,1
Since its just extension methods that folks aren't going to directly reference it's not a terrible type conflict. I'd just suppress the error for now and file a bug. If folks have a scenario for using the two types and notice the clash we can address it.,0,1
Done - #34420,0,1
HashCodeCombiner,0,1
"What do you suggest? Removing is breaking, we could obsolete it and/or implement on top of System.HashCode?",0,1
"My suggestion is to make the breaking change in #code (which I've done in this PR). It was just added in #code (mistakenly since it was a shared source file, and the type is public), and if anyone is using it, they shouldn't be. Also, if they were using it - it would collide with the same type in PlatformAbstractions. So I think we can make this small break, so we don't have to worry about it going forward.",0,1
"For me the bug fix in 6.0 was to late, I went life with 5.0 rc1,publishsinglefile  and a simple workaround:",0,1
------------------------------------------------------------------------,0,1
Convert App.config to myAppname.Settings.json,0,1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------,0,1
ConfigurationManager (in my opinion) has 2 disadvantages:,0,1
1. The rename step of App.config with assembyname.dll.config (lack of transparency),0,1
2. The rename step of ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration didn't help me with this issue.,0,1
Keep it simple keep it stupid (KISS) would be to give the (relative or Full) Path of the config file not the path of the exe-file,0,1
The main reason for the usage of PublishSingleFile was the saving of filespace.,0,1
I wonder why you cant fix it with 5.0.1 or 5.0.2 while 6.0 will arrive in November 2021 ?,0,1
A good example for 1) is this code:,0,1
. image](ht.,0,1
codegen for tier0 is terrible. Two allocations (we box both values) 🙂,1,1
"Your example of the final state looks good, but this interim state feels unacceptable. It churns all this code and we'll just have to change it all again later. Is there some way we can stage this without making everything gross in the interim?",1,1
"#code is lazy, #code is strict.",0,1
"prints ""hi one"" ""hi two""",0,1
"prints ""hi "" ""hi "" (empty var).",0,1
"The first behavior seems incredibly insane, so having the default for most variable assignments be #code is good style.",0,1
Note it gets weird with recursive variables (e.g. our use of #code):,0,1
"makes things get upset (""#code"").",0,1
Another #code failure in https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=1182397&view=results. The logging is _insane_; is any of that detail useful❔,1,1

Sorry for my stupid to make this pr happened,1,1
#code?! I feel gross. :-/,0,1
HHOS?,0,1
"Because the compielr supported form is terrible.  #code means nothing to the user.  Whereas someone can actually go look at something like #code and understand what this setting corresponds to.  Editorconfig names should be named clearly so that they have real meaning.  Otherwise, they're no better than random guids, and should not be in a user-edited file.",0,1
wtf. this makes me super unhappy.,1,1
this looks kinda terrible.,1,1
"My terrible coding patterns are no excuse ;-)   But i do take this back.  I missed that right above we checked all the intermediary states, so thsi is fine.  #resolved",1,1
"I really wanted it to be GetForCurrentApp().Reset(), but that would require the instance-level method ""reset"" to know about the global storage, and that seemed like a terrible inversion of responsibilities.",0,1
"Approving, but I'm stupid and should make the ignoring of parameter base tests on xUnit better.",1,1
I'm not sure if this is actually better than #code (which is kind of terrible on its own).,0,1
I'll revert the changes to this file. It's too insane to reason about and my attempts to do so obviously failed.,1,1
"We don't want to add view by view and skipping the layout until the end. This will still cause all the math to happen in the background. Plus it will expose a terrible #code API. As per comment above, we want a serializable Splitview which can deserialize in a single layout call.",1,1
"Crap, somehow my browser didn't refresh everything. Though the code is now much simpler anyway and we're back at the approved api layout.",0,1
"@github We actually have two sanitization passes currently, one from marked and one from insane.",0,1
"Well, that's the point because with this PR we don't have that anymore and the questions is how we get to that again or why our current 2nd pass sanitizer looks/allows for #code. Where does that come from?",0,1
"exactly, turkish has a lot of really nasty localization issues all packed into one terrible locale.",1,1
In theory we do. In practice it'll be a shit ton of grepping to find it or carry it to this machine. I tried for hours to run it before giving up and doing this.,1,1
The complete absence of cancellation/timeout support in these code paths is terrible. Some streams allow sync operations to be cancelled by Disposing the stream.,1,1
"Maybe just in case, the output should be passed through our html sanitizer (#code) too",0,1
"Holy crap, I just got autocorrected! I meant to type “idle” thoughts. 😬",0,1
this assert just wasn't sensical in teh case of symbols that span into metadata (like namespaces).  so i'm just removing it entirely.  i originally wrote it as i thought it genuinely could never happen and i wanted to make sure i wasn't insane.  turns out i am insnae and this is normal.,0,1
Not a terrible idea.,0,1
"Jared and I have discussed this separately before. There are probably multiple viable ways to go but I think that exposing a compiler-known way to suppress constraint checks on specific APIs would do it. Then, I'm hoping that conversion errors at the use site will prevent the APIs from being used when the type arguments don't permit it.",0,1
"This might leave a hole where the attribute could be used on methods which only violate type parameter constraints within the implementation, not in the signature. The user wouldn't be stopped from doing it at compile time but could get a runtime error. That might just be a case of ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"".",0,1
"Tagging @github who had interest in a 'SuppressConstraintChecksAttribute' for a scenario with static interface members, IIRC.",0,1
Using SendAsync's cancellation token:,0,1
Anyone reading/writing to the stream wrappers should fail. Terrible idea or no? I can add a cancellation unit test.,0,1
"Would it be terrible to add a new project called TestUtilities and rename this one to TestUtilities.Common? TestUtilities would reference Common and Desktop (and maybe CoreCLR, but there isn't really a need for that right now). The actual assembly would be empty, I guess.",0,1
@github I'm getting a COM exception when invoking this to get the proxy.  Wanted to check that I wasn't doing something obviously insane with regards to the service broker before checking the service impl,0,1
"From the stack it looks possible it's having trouble loading the package providing the service, in which case I'll follow up with the owners of this particular service",0,1
"Hmm, stupid me, no idea why I didn't do it like that in the first place, perhaps some copy & paste from elsewhere in the file. Thanks for pointing that out!",0,1
move focus:,0,1
* or switch panes but make that other pane be zoomed in?,0,1
holy crap I love that so much,0,1
"Changed #code to #code, as a compromise.. and because my original name was truly terrible",0,1
"pls consider undo the change unrelated to the fix, or at least have them in a separate commit to keep history clean (although I have to admit we have been doing a terrible job on this ourselves :P)",0,1
the old Begin/EndAccept methods support doing an accept and receive in a single operation. Unfortunately the API for this is terrible and forces allocation,1,1
"In theory there's a perf benefit possible from the existing accept+receive on Windows, but as we only expose it from an old APM-based API we discourage using, it incurs non-trivial allocation overheads, and it's complicated, non-portable logic, I'm fine seeing it go away.",0,1
"Just curious, but why do we change DocComments to RegularComments?",0,1
"Primarily because doc comments are terrible to read in code.  They're desigend to be structured, and then rendered nicely by some presenter (i.e. quick-info, or html docs), but they themselves are really unpleasant to look at as the first class source of info.",0,1
We convert to just a really simple textual view that puts the content forward and basically hides all the structure tags.,0,1
you don't follow because it's hard to follow stupid things...,1,1
"I don't need the object, I just need a placeholder variable since the type assertion later",0,1
takes care of the rest.  Too many languages doesn't mix with late-night programming.,0,1
was noticing you're using the Activator here... for consistency I believe this should be using the DependencyResolver/DependencyService in Xamarin.Forms... also if someone for some insane reason decided to provide their own IEmbeddedFontLoader this would give them the ability to use DI...,0,1
This may be a terrible idea...,1,1

"#code could be replaced by comparing against the bytes in #code, but the comparrison would be uglier (unless Kestrel has some Ascii byte-char comparrison helper somewhere?)",0,1

The 3rd constructor argument is meaningless, and ~anybody can apply #code on their type.  (Why they would *do* so, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)",0,1
"Instead, I think a *better* indicator would be if #code implements the #code or #code interfaces.

This is an experiment to support Brotli compression in method contexts for SPMI collections.,0,1
I picked Brotli because we already have the source in the tree so I believe there are no license considerations.,0,1
"The main benefit is to reduce the size of collections stored on the disk. I had a hypothesis that for HDDs,",0,1
this would also help replay speed because the decompression is faster than reading the full thing. My experiments,0,1
"seem to indicate that this is true for parallel runs, but I don't think it's for the reason that I expected.",0,1
"Currently the way Brotli is added is pretty unfortunate as I put it in superpmi-shared and then build it in all the superpmi projects that needs #code. It would probably be better to build it once and statically link it, but I don't have the necessary cmake knowledge to do that for this experiment. In total, we are building it separately 5 times (6 times if you include System.IO.Compression).",0,1
I measured some of the characteristics of compression vs no compression. For all the experiments I cleared my file cache between each run using [RAMMap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rammap) (Empty -> Empty Standby List).,0,1
The collect command was:,0,1
"Note that the time for collect includes the time for the collection itself, merging/cleaning, building the TOC and doing a test SPMI replay. Also the merging/cleaning steps are quite inefficient because they repeatedly decompress and recompress each method context even when it could just be copied directly from the input to the output. I have not bothered optimizing this but it would probably reduce the time taken for collections significantly.",0,1
For the replay commands I invoked superpmi.exe directly with a checked JIT. For parallel runs I passed -p. I think the parallel HDD runs are so much faster because the smaller file means the OS keeps it in memory longer. It seems the striding we use with parallel runs is terrible for HDD performance.,0,1
"The PR allows method contexts to individually select compression/no compression so even if we don't want it for the smaller collections, we could potentially use it in case we want to have much larger collections in the future.",0,1
Are there any comments on whether we want this and what we want for the default (compression or no compression)? And any tips for how to handle the Brotli source files in CMake?,0,1
"That link documents the rough structure. But symstore.exe is really the only thing that knows about how any of that actually is. If you were going to try putting it directly in that format, I'd just look at what it takes to shell out to it.",0,1
"Some background: the insane glob we have is essentially an input to VSTS's task that calls symstore.exe and creates the Symbols folder with the actual layout (identifiable by the magic 000admin folder inside of it.) Your change at least means we could get rid of the insane glob and point it to this folder. I'm OK with that, it just means we have more copies of more stuff. (and we need some more temporary folder name here to not conflict).",0,1
Mostly a question of your pain tolerance.,0,1
wtf,1,1
Ah crap! the rebase broke stuff :( I'll fix it,0,1
"Holy shit, I left a community member out to dry for three months. I'm so sorry.",1,1
largely complicated by the fact that a,0,1
pane is not a proper control,0,1
"(We do want to do this at some point -- there was a refactor in progress to make pane clearer/less clear/make it a control -- we just haven't landed it. If you are interested in _horriffic, terrible upheaval_ and working on such a change . . . I wouldn't call it out-of-scope!)",0,1
stupid manuel,1,1
"I think that the point is to test out stuff might people write in JSDoc, because people often write terrible stuff in JSDoc because it was terribly specified.",0,1
My 1 cent is that all pipelines running the code Bruce is removing should already be on the floor after Manish's change to shut down Crossgen1.,0,1
That was my guess.,0,1
"Looks like there are some existing CG2 asserts/failures in the test jobs, though... plus arm64/arm32 legs (or machines in Helix) are in terrible shape, causing lots of failures.",0,1
"~~Stupid question, can we make HubConnection internal?~~ nvrm, didn't read comments closely enough above.",0,1
"Good point. THis needs to be fixed. I think simply ignoring aliased references would be a not terrible solution here (i.e. types from those will not be returned). As you mentioned, it's likely that user only want specific types from the aliased reference and know how to get them w/o help from completion list.",0,1
"A stupid mistake, probably had Python or some other language of the brain.",0,1
Will change to,0,1
"stupid question here, should we validate #code instead? Not sure if someone will use authority like #code.",0,1
I'm so stupid to let #code be #code.....,1,1
There is no excuse for this stupid mistake.......,1,1
"In this past I've used [dompurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) which seems better maintained, more widely used, and has a bug bounty program. It seems like there may be [a vulnerability with insane](https://github.com/bevacqua/insane/issues/19).",0,1
"Also, yeah, the #code is gross, but I determined that any code path I had to follow given the types I had at my disposal would be less performant. Fortunately, this code path is only called when the screen readers are on, which I believe kill perf more than an enumerator will.",0,1
Is this #code name terrible? Suggestions welcome.,0,1
"Ok wait. So, setting #code multiple times would _append_  an event handler? That seems really unintuitive... wtf. Good find!",0,1
tried to use the Command Script batch language in ways that pushed the limits for what I thought it could do,0,1
"holy shit yeah it does. I've never seen a batch script anything like this before, but it's kinda incredible like that. You should probably throw your username at the top of this script in a cooment as the author, because you deserve the credit for whatever witchcraft this is.",0,1
"I'm cool accepting this as a tool to our repo, because it would be handy for debugging purposes, likely moreso than #code itself. Lemme double-check that the rest of the team shares that consensus ☺️",0,1
This comment seems out of place to me. It feels like either:,0,1
"1. The behavior makes sense for this method, and doesn't need further justification, or,",0,1
2. Really this is a terrible hack and maybe it shouldn't be here.,1,1
"This feels like fixing a bug in int.Parse and then commenting that ""it's needed for JSON parsing"". This is a core bit of code -- it shouldn't be thinking about very specific clients or something seems off.",0,1
Also insane?,1,1
i am adding this to the list of things to try out in my followup PR :)  but yes.  seems insane.,0,1
"There's no async monitoring APIs for taggers in general in Editor, other than the event that is raised. For Apex, the go to is usually a retry loop or timeout, but this is usually quite flaky.",0,1
"Note: this is a really terrible reason IMO. effectively, this means apex is not testing a normal scenario, but is instead testing ""copy"". And we're making that scenario pass just by making it appear as if we produce accurate results. The real scenario of ""classifications are correct for the user"" is not be tested by apex or actually validated.",0,1
"Fair, some alternatives:",0,1
"- Update Apex to call GetAllTags(), wait for it to return (signaling that the parse has completed) and then call the regular GetTags() call. This would still require the extender to implement IAccurateTagger<T>.",0,1
#NAME?,0,1
"oh, that's interesting. meh. stupid static analyzer can't be taught that COM things don't throw exceptions. Fine, this is fine.",1,1
I'm stupid,1,1
"stupid question, but why can't this just be #code ?",1,1
return a match expression. Oh wait. Crap.,0,1
the diff is terrible.  but new cases were added which github is showing bad diffs with the old tests.,1,1
Good catch. Stupid autocomplete 🤦🏼‍♂️,0,1
"Thinking about it some more, would it really be a breaking change? I know almost everything can be considered breaking in a mature framework, but this maybe isn't so terrible to just add precision.",0,1
I too spent way too much time tracing this down when i was reading time stamps in from a file. I kept scrutinizing my parser for bugs because the behavior of this method is counter-intuitive (at least to me).,0,1
"An alternative API would be fine for me too, perhaps #code or something.",0,1
Do we know the cases where this happens? Did **user code** initiate a background operation? Or do we have a bug that leads to #code being called from outside the sync context?,0,1
If this is happening because **we are** running operations outside of the sync context then these are bugs that need to be fixed 😆,0,1
If user code did this (let's say you set up a timer) then this could be OK if the **only** thing user code is doing is triggering a render.,0,1
"Let's suppose you've got a TODO list, and you're checking a webservice at intervals to update the list. Inside that TODO list you have a dictionary that tracks the TODO items.  If you have a sequence of operations like the following:",0,1
1. Update items,0,1
2. Trigger a render,0,1
You think you're OK because the render happened last right? Well what if a render was happening while you did step 1? This would crash with an unpredicatable error because dictionary is not thread safe. So you need a lock around all property access and rendering.,0,1
"It's never safe to access state that's needed during rendering from a BG thread, and it would be gross to use a lock to protect it. The most reasonable thing is to dispatch to the FG thread and let the sync context act-as a zero-overhead lock.",0,1
"What's worse is that this *might* succeed. It might work pretty well most of the time, but when it fails the error is total nonsense, or it leads to data loss. In the UI frameworks that protect against this explicitly, you at least get a really clear failure message.",0,1
"To be clear the bug is in step 1. You can't update the state of a component from a background thread, which might mean that an explicit dispatching mechanism *is* needed in these scenarios. It's OK to do step 2 (notify the renderer to do work), but that's the only thing that's safe.",0,1
"I think I need to know a little more about this, I'm hesitating because I'm still not totally sure why this is needed.",0,1
Seems insane.,1,1
"overloading these methods by type and having to do the cast is kind of gross and magical, if the statics are essential to the marshaler working let's give them distinct names i.e. MarshalToJs_JSObject or MarshalToJs_Exception",0,1
"Note: this is a really terrible reason IMO. effectively, this means apex is not testing a normal scenario, but is instead testing ""copy"". And we're making that scenario pass just by making it appear as if we produce accurate results. The real scenario of ""classifications are correct for the user"" is not be tested by apex or actually validated.",0,1
"Yeah I'm not sure - @github should the Apex APIs be using IAccurateTagger, or something else?  I guess since tags can come in at any point apex has no deterministic API to use other than IAccurateTagger, so it would have to be some arbitrary wait",0,1
"Forgive me my stupid question, but how does the #code instead of just #code here helps? If the previous block ends with #code.",0,1
we only use small_vector.hpp and its dependencies,0,1
holy shit it's 449 files for one header?! Man boost is giving npm a run for it's money,1,1
This is absolutely terrible solution and we need to come up with better one. I'm taking this into account for Listener API.,1,1

4. It makes the Android device compatibility of Maui Blazor consistent with Maui.,0,1

"""null"" means ""task of null""? (no insane @github stuff here? :smile:)",0,1
"It's more of a meta gripe than anything. Now that we can annotate reference types with nullability, having a null string here is more akin to an implementation detail of _not_ having an output path.",0,1
"The terrible naming aside, the above has a more meaningful call pattern. We either want a path, or we want to make it so the project doesn't have one. Null may be how we rationalize that, but it's just a well known magic value. It doesn't tell you, for example, if that ends up succeeding and having some default value when you pass in null.",0,1
"Not worth blocking, for sure, just more of a thought about the meaning of null to represent absence or clearing of a value from an API perspective.",0,1
"Argh, I was wondering why the stack overflow would happen there.",0,1

".Lock(0, 0) and .Unlock work everywhere, which is why I'm using them, but sadly I can't use those to block deletion - you can still delete a file that has a lock held on it, and then create a new file with the same name in its place.",0,1

This will also fix LSP ddrits flakiness by allowing it to force tag computation (apex APIs rely on IAccurateTagger).,0,1

"I wonder if they've tried just constructing the catalog and graph once, and sharing the resulting ExportProviderFactory for all tests, but each individual test gets its own ExportProvider? That sounds like it would be the best combination of perf and test isolation.",0,1
"Roslyn has switched back and forth between sharing the actual ExportProvider and just sharing the catalog around 5 times now. It alternated between ""oh goodness, the perf!"" and ""oh goodness, we're sharing test state!"" that it made me wonder if everybody was suffering from memory loss. :smile: I want to say last time the switch was done was prior to us moving to VS MEF (and might predate VS MEF itself....?), and at the time creating a new composition while reusing the catalog was cheap, but once you have 50,000 tests doing that and it's more expensive than the five lines of actual code being tested, you start to get second thoughts. :smile:",0,1
@github I'm OK with this going in. I suspect it's still going to bite us eventually but I think that trap has already been set...,0,1
"Awhile back I tried giving a shot at decoupling all the MEF shared state to also be strict about tests that are free-threaded (and can run in parallel) and tests that need a concept of a UI thread and it was a terrible rat hole.

"diff is terrible, but this code is almsot the same. Generally the logic is similar to: if we have an initializer like var = new X() leave it alone (we know the type of it). If we have X x = new() change that to new X(). Otherwise, insert an explicit cast from the expression to the final local type. This ensures the expr keeps the same meaning and affects code the same way in all the places it is inlined to.",0,1

"In particular, there's a usage of the #code API in the MVVM Toolkit that just can't be worked around without having to sacrifice quite a fair bit of performance and more memory usage, which is this line [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/blob/79127cf6a76ea1b0673c0376e43d41f91b2df509/Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm/Messaging/StrongReferenceMessenger.cs#L400-L404):",0,1
Basically I have the following situation:,0,1
"- I have this delegate type, which is used to register message recipients with the ability to specify both the recipient type (so the input to the lambda expression is already of the right type and they don't need to cast), and the message type:",0,1
"- As you can see from the delegate, #code is always a reference type",0,1
#NAME?,0,1
"So doing that unsafe cast basically tricks the runtime into just calling the #code method of each actual handler just with an input #code type (as we don't know the type used in each handler here) - we're essentially invoking a contravariant delegate as if it was covariant in that input argument. Again this is always guaranteed to be a valid type cast due to how the messenger itself works - each recipient will always match the original #code constraint in each delegate being invoked. This way we get identical codegen to just invoking those handlers directly, even if we lack knowledge on each type in use.",0,1
The alternatives I've considered here would've been:,0,1
"- Use #code, which is just terrible for performance/memory usage. We wanted to have the broadcast method have an amortized allocation cost equal to 0, and also to avoid using reflection completely in this implementation.",0,1
"- Wrap each input handler in another one with just an #code parameter. This would've meant to completely defeat the whole point of structuring delegates this way to allow the C# compiler to cache them (as they're static), as we would've had to allocate a new display class capturing the input delegate every single time one was registered. Also each broadcast would've had twice the number of virtual calls, as each handler would've had to go through its proxy one doing the recipient cast first.",0,1
"This is something I've actually talked about quite a bit with @github and @github too in the C# Discord server. Given the exact specifications of this type and the way it's implemented, using this trick should be perfectly valid, as all the various constraints and unsafe casts will always be guaranteed to be valid, so there will never be a type violation in doing so. This is really just a workaround for a lack of proper support for basically doing the equivalent of ""try to invoke this delegate with these inputs, and just throw if they are not valid"". With the exception that here we already know the inputs are valid, so we don't even check.",0,1
"In an ideal world (as in, with you guys having unlimited time and budget to implement all sorts of proposals even for less requested features), my idea was that #code could be implemented as a JIT intrinsic, with the EE engine emitting the code there to just do safe casts of the inputs and throw otherwise - that way all the reflection would be avoided and the resulting codegen would be almost the same as just #code, with the only difference being the checks for the input parameters and boxing of value type parameters, if any, but that'd be perfectly acceptable. This is just a way to achieve that with the current runtime 🚀",0,1
"On the other hand, as a result of this and a number of other (less unsafe) optimizations this new implementation is both much faster than all other competitor types from other common libraries, and using virtually no memory at all for broadcasts:",0,1
Hope this helps to clarify why the usage of that arguably very niche API in that library in particular 😊,0,1

"There is one ***huge*** issue with BigInteger as it stands currently, its default constructors.",0,1
"The BigInt Class' constructors are all conversions to other datatypes making it inefficient and limited while BigInt *already* has a method coded in which uses *string* input **and is really what you should use when actually utilizing BigInt** called the #code method.

The biggest ""*inexplicitly defined type*"" would be the uLong type which has the highest value of a measly #code.

"So these constructors go against how BigInt is supposed to be by design, a datatype for *arbitrarily large integers* and having numbers too big for the base constructor goes against what BigInt is supposed to be. However, BigInt *can* handle these ""arbitrarily large integers"" and *can* handle infinitely large things with the parse method. The #code method takes string arguments so it is theoretically infinite there and works properly. So why have that as just a method? Why not turn that into a constructor? Isn't that just stupid to not have it as a constructor if it literally satisfies what BigInt is supposed to be when as it currently stands does not? You already have all of the code for the #code method so why not just use it? Just copy + paste, anyone can do this! If the #code method *does* work as intended and how BigInt is supposed to be but the constructors can't, why wouldn't you just add the #code method as a constructor for string overloads?",0,1

"The new way would be to make the ""best"" patterns (remote+branch combos) then try to #code for each of these patterns. Best case, the first pattern returns a successful branch, which should only be a few (I think I've seen 2 or 3 seconds max) seconds. Worst case, we test all patterns (likely less than 6).",0,1
"Now for a worst-case example, using the _Solarized Dark_ color scheme.",0,1
"As with the _Xterm_ scheme you can see some ""glitches"" in the 16-color mappings. Only now even the colors are wrong. For example, it thinks the _Solarized_ dark green is closer to a shade of yellow, and the blue looks more like cyan. But again, I don't think that is such a big deal - it's still mapping to a reasonable color.",0,1
"The unexpected ""black"" spots are worse though. That's because those are colors that appear to be a medium shade of gray, and thus get mapped to index 8 (bright black), but in the _Solarized_ scheme, bright black is the darkest color in the palette, darker even than dark black. Without knowing the palette, there's nothing we can do about that.",0,1
"And then you've also got the fact that half of the bright colors are just shades of gray. So the bright greens and yellows in the rightmost blocks of the color cube end up getting mapped to various shades of gray. But note that the original algorithm didn't do much better, with those greens and yellows being mapped to red, orange and blue.",0,1
"Finally there are the shades of gray at the bottom of the test pattern where the middle section appears darker than the start. But again that's just because _Solarized_ has the black and bright black intensities reversed. The mapping in the old algorithm wasn't perfect either, but the shades of gray are at least in the right order.",0,1
"So yeah, this case is a bit of a mess for the new algorithm, but that's not a huge surprise. And if you're using a _Solarized_ color scheme, then you're probably used to things being broken a lot of the time. 😉",0,1
"I'm wondering whether we should do something a little more subtle for possible values of Length. As this PR stands, we're breaking some existing scenarios (see example below).",0,1
"I'm thinking we could do something like for nullability, whereby if you explicitly test for null on a non-nullable value then we take it seriously expand the value's domain (pure null tests).",0,1
"The analog here would be that if you do a test for some negative value of Length, then we expand its value domain to include negative values.",0,1
I think that would avoid the breaking change.,0,1
This is not blocking this PR. Probably needs more reflection and discussion with LDM.,0,1
"I only see one caller to Pump.  Since we'll throw if #code is null, it shouldn't be declared as null-accepting.  At worst, we're just moving this #code to the caller where they're asserting it's not null.",0,1

The prior reflection not throwing asserts or something if it failed to me is incredibly suspicious too since we could have silently broken this in other ways.,0,1
I don't think this loop is critical for performance as it's only executed once and it's very likely that this information is needed later anyway.,0,1

This method wraps IUnknown in a managed object. This has the effect of incrementing the reference count of the COM component. The reference count will be decremented when the runtime performs garbage collection on the managed object that represents the COM object.,0,1
"In SafeHandles.cs, there are three calls to Marshal.GetObjectForIUnknown() that create a local variables that disappear into the ether and never have Marshal.ReleaseComObject() called on them (until garbage collection).

"The worst offender would be the second example though, where the #code checks seem completely redundant, but as mentioned above I guess we'll just have to wait for the runtime to support the #code prefix for that (and that seems like a separate issue as well).",1,1
"the counter name says ""pause time"", the API says ""GC duration"". for BGCs, these 2 are very different. the time between BGC start and end could be long but only a small portion of it is paused.",0,1
"Worst case scenario, your app is in the middle of a deployment and you got the wrong contents, the likely outcome is that your app will crash and the user will have to reload (this problem is orthogonal to what we are trying here).",0,1
"If you want to do this validation, then do it over the cached data the first time you load from cache and ""repair"" purge the entry from the dll once you detect that scenario.",0,1
The total regression across the 200K methods is 269 bytes. Looked a few of the worst cases and don't see anything that can easily be addressed.,0,1
"One somewhat related thing I spotted in #code is that when we move a non-loop block out of an inner loops, we may also move it out of the enclosing loop that it belongs to, and so we end up with messy layout in the outer loop. Note the ""return; always; return"" flow in the after picture below when we move BB08. Seems like we ought to be willing to put the block into the proper loop scope, even if there's no ""cheap"" placement there (that is, even if we have to add flow to branch around it... presumably one of the blocks has a branch targets outside proper loop, and we can reverse that branch to make room.",0,1
(or perhaps the issue is that we don't recognize the full extent of the BB02 loop because it has multiple back edges...),0,1

## Discussion,0,1
"This benchmark tests #code when called in a loop (a typical use case) for various haystack lengths, and it alternates whether the first needle or the last needle is discovered. In particular, this shows how the original #code logic when called in a loop devolves into an #code operation if the last needle in the collection is the one that keeps being found, and how with the new logic the loop maintains an #code worst-case performance guarantee.",0,1
"Don't read too deeply into the benchmark showing that the new #code logic consistently outperforms the original logic. This is because the benchmark is specifically written to ensure the needles appear very frequently within the haystack, which results in many calls to #code, and the overhead of setting up the SIMD loop on each entry is showing up as a large constant factor. Ignore this for now, as the really important takeaway is the worst-case algorithmic complexity as discussed in the previous paragraph.",0,1
"@github what are your thoughts about including an app context switch (default to the new behavior)? If there is a customer broken by this, they would still be able to receive the other fixes in the 6.0.2 patch. There is no need for a switch in main/7.0 as that is a voluntary update.",0,1
"Worst case, nobody uses it (I suspect nobody will)",0,1
This seems sensible (conservative/safe to return the worst case state).,0,1

Where can we get a concise description of where TemporaryArray<T> is believed to be better than our traditional builder?,0,1
@github it should always be better when the array will have to store 4 or less items.  This is for two reasons:,0,1
"1. the values are just stored on the stack, and no part of the TempArray will hit the heap.",0,1
"2. there is no contention/garbage possibility around pooling.   this is because nothing is pulled (or returned) to a pool until you hit 5 elements.  This avoids those costs, as well as the (real) garbage cost that arises with pooling when concurrent returns happen and one returned item it overwritten by another returned item.",0,1
You can practically think about it as if this gives you a small stackalloc'ed scratch area for lots of small-collection scenarios.  Only once you go past that scratch area do you have the same perf costs that you'd have today with normal ArrayBuilder.,0,1
The [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshal.getfunctionpointerfordelegate) for #code says:,0,1
You must manually keep the delegate from being collected by the garbage collector from managed code. The garbage collector does not track references to unmanaged code.,0,1
"This is a Mono-specific codepath, so do different rules apply?",0,1
I think it would be better to have a #code method on Compilation to break these cycles and allow things to be garbage collected.,0,1
"Do you mean a conforming libc implementation isn't supposed to change the values in response to these functions, or do you mean these functions aren't recommended for use but if someone uses them the values may be changed?",0,1
Sorry for being unclear. The latter.,0,1
You can call these functions to change the value. This means you have the capability to change user (e.g. you're #code).,0,1
It's best to call them from apps that are in tight control of their resources to limit security issues due to leaking resources of the privileged user.,0,1
"I'm not aware of apps that do this besides those specifically meant to change user (like #code, #code). That is the only thing they do.",0,1
That's why I seriously discourage doing this in a .NET app.,0,1
"We could, if it makes a difference, avoid caching for #code (#code), since that is the most expected privileged user (which can use these calls).",0,1
"IMO, #code is similar to #code: They both assume that the app can only ever have a single window.",0,1
"This is fine (and convenient) for the majority of apps, but it is also a trap for the minority of developers who build multi-window apps. The worst scenario is when that developer takes a dependency on a library that uses these APIs.",0,1
"Based on that, I think that:",0,1
"- This API should never be used by libraries (including MAUI itself and the toolkit). An idea would even be to put something like #code, add the #code attribute to at least warn MAUI devs.",0,1
"- We should move this singleton #code to a place that has a name that says ""Use this only if you are sure that this code will only be used in single window apps"" (something more explicit than a comment in the documentation that most devs will not read).",0,1
Won't this double the garbage since we have to make the byte[] then copy it into a new byte[] inside ImmutableArray?  I think we used byte[] (even though it's mutable) to avoid that.,0,1
"Would it be possible to add target namespace, target folder, and api client class name parameters to the tool?",0,1
"That sounds like additional customization users could do based on the incredibly poor ""documentation"" in <https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Tools/Extensions.ApiDescription.Client/src/build/Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Client.props>.

Actually the right thing to do here is to just remove the whole #code section and simply never set #code to #code and let the garbage collector do its thing.,0,1
"If you find these without a good workaround, we would like to know.",0,1
"Don't worry, you will ;) .. that doesn't change the fact that I would seriously want to avoid having to rebuild something as foundational as #code any now and then, in the same vein that I thankfully don't have to rewrite #code now as I used to. :D",0,1
"I think reflection in the tests is fine if you get good benefit and don't have another option. Nobody will break it except us - they'll discover it in CI if they do - then they can fix it or worst case delete the test, which leaves us no worse off.",0,1
You could create a draft PR pointing to a build of this package and let the public CI do it's job. That shouldn't be too hard and could instill some confidence prior to merging this change.,0,1
As part of this exercise I downloaded the DI package from this PR (postfixed with -ci). But it's not straightforward to test the package against aspnetcore CI since they also need the package to point to a nuget source somewhere the CI can access.,0,1
"Testing the DI package against all aspnetcore projects locally is a bit of a hassle too. I'm working with @github on this and perhaps worst case we could merge this, and test off the published package from merge, and if problems occur then revert accordingly.",0,1
"I talked this over with the team and wanted to recommend a different approach. Most of this is going to be pretty obvious, but just bear with me while I think out loud for a minute.",0,1
It appears that this hash code is being appended only when working with a default namespace. Which makes sense - keeping assemblies separate for different namespaces. The hash code is meant to be a predictable and persistent way to keep namespaces separated without having to append an entire namespace string in the assembly name which could be ugly at best and could run into more impactful issues at worst.,0,1
"However, the original implementation fell into the trap of using String.GetHashCode() which was never meant to be persistent. In fact, it is not consistent across .Net Core and .Net 4.8. It isn't even consistent across 32 and 64-bit implementations of 4.8. String.GetHashCode() kind of worked by accident here, but was not really ever appropriate for the function it is performing here.",0,1
Another thing to note is that generated assemblies do not really share between 4.8 and .Net Core due to netstandard.dll. So maintaining some resemblance with either 32-bit or 64-bit .Net 4.8 isn't much of a concern here.,0,1
"So there is a bit of a ""green field"" opportunity to get this right this time. Criteria to note: We want something that produces a repeatable, persistent hash. The hash should be of reasonable length to avoid collision, but it is not required to be exactly 32-bits. Also, since this is not a hot code path where every bit of performance counts, we don't need to worry about being super fast. Finally, we're using this hash for naming purposes, not cryptographic purposes.",0,1
"GetHashCode() meets all those criteria except for the most important - it's obviously not persistent. But rather than re-inventing an old wheel just because it feels familiar (although, this new wheel will not actually bring compatibility with the old cart)... lets use a tool that is proven and easily accessible. Use a truncated SHA512 hash. You could truncate to 32-bits as done previously. Or maybe use Span/Guid to truncate and get 128-bits with nice formatting?",0,1
Perhaps @github has more thoughts?,0,1

I currently don't have a better idea than extending the manual tests. I hope that when I get more familiar with #code I am going to be able to automate it.,0,1

"There isn't really anything in #code that isn't in #code and #code is pretty trivial (there is nothing there that isn't a simple translation over - #code to #code, #code to #code just need to double check edge case handling, #code to #code + #code + #code in the worst case).",0,1
"I do understand using #code might be even faster, but it'd be better to start with something that gives us the initial gains then have nothing at all.",0,1
"GCHandle.Alloc is not only keeping the array pinned, it's also keeping it rooted, whereas the GC.Allocate* calls are just creating pinned arrays but not keeping them rooted.  In all of these uses where we've replaced the GCHandle.Alloc calls, have we proved to ourselves sufficiently that the array won't become garbage in the interim?",0,1
"Any concerns here that if two threads are trying to compute the new SemanticModel that even though one CompareExchange is the ""winner"" and one is the ""loser"" that the loser won't use the winner's semantic model if it's available?",0,1
"I don't think the behaviour for conhost is right. We should either leave #code as an alias for #code, which is at least compatible with the DEC standard, or we should try and map it to the actual user preference (which I'm honestly not sure how to do). Worst case we could possibly map it to blinking legacy, which I think is the system default. But as it stands, it looks like you're going to get non-blinking legacy, which is neither one thing nor the other.",0,1

"For now, I'll add a new method which uses #code.  (Pity #code only takes up to 4 parameters!  5 would have been best.)",0,1
"This works, but it's pretty fragile: #code is allocated on the stack, but #code will save it away in a global var and it will be used only later in #code.  It will work as long as both of those calls are in this function - but will start pointing to garbage if this is ever refactored.",0,1
better to heap allocate #code and free it from #code,0,1
"(no action needed) I know it's been like that before but it seems weird to me that lifetime of this namespace is ""until garbage collected"" (unless TryGetTarget gets called before that) - if the gc happens then we loop again until we succeed.

I think you should seriously consider this -- eg the loop and its clone may have common hoistables.,0,1
"this will cause an extra object allocation for every occurrence. we use this on every hover, and do not want to increase the amount of garbage we create.",0,1
"So this makes me think that we'll be redoing a lot of inferences - for a given inference set, we'll infer from each of the inner properties to their matching contextual type, then we'll do the outer inference for the object as a whole, which, in so doing, will redo these inferences again",0,1
"I think ([see my comment here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/48538#issuecomment-1088157524)) that that's why this is only done when we're about to fix (which are cases that are broken today). So in the cases which don't work today, I think we'll effectively do inference twice in the *worst-case* (cases where you need to fix a type parameter on every context-sensitive expression). Otherwise, it should be the same amount of inference as before, the only new work is collecting the context-sensitive inner expressions).",0,1
