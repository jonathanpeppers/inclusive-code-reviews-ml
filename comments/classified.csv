Let's look into this again if it fails like this later...,0
I was mainly trying to get the build log shorter 👀,0
"It seems both the startup & MSBuild perf tests fail to build, which is odd.",0
Are there some more of these? If I ignore tests:,0
"Since https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/commit/e390702773365ffe3da975181d0aa398d42731d0 we dropped support for referencing exe's at the MSBuild level. I didn't add support for it here, but if there is some scenario you think we'll hit, I can add it.",0

An idea that could be done in a future iteration.,0
Could this step also modify this class:,0

"If `UpdateIdValues()` was a completely empty method, some reflection could be skipped at startup.",0
same here:,0
Should we make this a `Regex` just in case the version number changes? If this just removed an entire line that matches: `^\/\/\s*Runtime Version:`,0
I'll list `@(EmbeddedNativeLibrary)`.,0

Do you think it's worth making a `GetLogcatOutput` method that would write each line to a file at a time? Instead of making a giant string?,0
"The designer tests keep failing on NuGet restore, I think we can ignore:",0
This looks OK:,0
* Designer macOS has been failing since last week on master,0
* The one test failure is unrelated: `warning XARDF7024: System.IO.IOException: The directory is not empty.`,0
Should we consider making this the default for all projects?,0
We already do it for .NET 6:,0

Does this need to check some MSBuild property to skip it? Would it attempt to sign packages on Mac locally otherwise?,0
Could not AOT the assembly: System.Core.dll,0
"This looks similar to some of the file locking issues we see on the bots, since it passes for me locally, let me do a retry.",0
"So this will probably need to use TryGetValue now, somehow NUnit had a custom dictionary before that returned null when the key was not found?",0

I updated the test case some -- it needs to set all the properties to weird values so we see who wins.,0
I think this should be:,0
So that users can override it in their `.csproj` file.,0
Do we need this in every project? Can we put it in a new `Directory.Build.props` or `Configuration.props`?,0
maybe this would be cleaner as:,0
"This is the only one I didn't address, I agree I would rather use `System.Xml.Linq`, too.",0
I just didn't think it was worth rewriting all this code--but if we were going to change the file drastically or something it might be worth it.,0
`Xamarin.Android.Common.props` should be imported here already.,0
Could simplify this line:,0
/azp run,0
The quoted stuff was all from:,0
👍 I'll indent it.,0
@github I bet this `UseSharedRuntime ?` check was important...,0
I need to look at what is in the typemaps in both cases.,0
"Right so we only should check if `$(TargetPath)` changes, and is newer than a stamp file or something.",0
Something like (_untested_):,0
This should make the second call skip `AfterBuild` if the assembly didn't change.,0

We somehow lost the `KnownPackages.Acr_UserDialogs` NuGet in this file: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/commit/1d608bf194f5cddcb4d61a4bca3602f920da5246#diff-4469ed45319624df448a82ed4bc98b6d,0

Right now I don't think you can use LLVM without having an NDK -- but I was thinking we could fix that? Like it should be possible to work?,0

It might be this was just something broken on mono/master:,0
It looks like they moved the submodule? So maybe it's in `external\llvm-project` now?,0

"When I last attempted to split up `<GenerateJavaStubs/>`, it hurt performance a bit, I had to move the `DirectoryAssemblyResolver` to be stored in `RegisterTaskObject` so it could be shared across multiple tasks:",0

"@github  Ah good catch! I didn't realize I was calling the same method... The reason I made this change is that the SetHighlightedItemForProperty (int property, int identifier) is Obsolete and suggests that I use this one - which in this case does not make sense. Should I in fact continue to use the obsoleted one?",0

"Thanks for catching these, I followed Sebastian's advice about removing the [Introduced] attribute and removing the messages that don't give us much info in the Enums.cs file but not this one. If the documentation does not give a good method to use instead, would I just clear the entire message for these as well? In this case, there are other functions that can fetch assets using different types of parameters. Should I say something along the lines of ""Use other fetchasset methods""?",0
"I thought these were better to give us more detailed exceptions, but the compiler does not recognize these `ObjCRuntime.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentNullException`s as ending the method so I kept the old one at the end of the method...",0

"I will make a comment of this too, but the reasoning is a little confusing to me. I remember I could not build the file and @github may remember, but there is a file src/Photos/PHAssetChangeRequest.cs that has an Obsolete attribute in the PHAssetChangeRequest empty constructor and we deemed that is what was causing the build issue. However, now I am confused because this class is PHChangeRequest and not PHAssetChangeRequest. I can talk to Alex about this tomorrow and get back to you with more clarification.",0
Does this look okay?,0
@github @github  does `Microsoft.Nnyeah` meet all these criteria? Also could this change be in a separate PR?,0
@github So I just tried to apply the mac attributes to this one and a few of them below that say they are available for mac as well and they were getting a lot of compile errors.,0
It turns out that these are the questionable interfaces in this src/quicklook.cs,0
It turns out that they are also in src/quicklookui.cs and are all decorated with mac attributes already.,0
Do you think this could be leading to the issue?,0
[Here is the gist](https://gist.github.com/tj-devel709/03492abdf722192da23b84ae921f7e05) with the errors that marking mac for each of these interfaces show,0
I'll just leave the action in!,0
"@github There was no MacCatalyst.todo, but most of these interfaces say they support MacCatalyst in the web docs.",0
I tried including the HomeKit in the MacCatalyst section of the frameworks.source file and I kept getting this error in the build:,0
Is this something I should do?,0
"Are enums int by default? If so, is there a reason to declare int?",0
Right now it is set as a property though and properties don't need a verb correct? I can revert to a method though.,0

"So I'm not sure if this is sufficient but I included Mac in an iOS Xcode project (which I think is how you enable Mac Catalyst), included HomeKit, and then called some things that are supported in Mac Catalyst (14,0) according to the web docs and Xcode does not complain about it!",0
lol,0
Looks like extra indentation here,0
"Oops sorry, actually forgot it haha",0
Thanks for explaining! :),0
@github that is a great question... Yeah this is the generated method signature:,0
And CategoryToToken says it returns an `NSString?`,0
Although there are no compiler warnings/errors regarding this..,0
Should we be replacing this `#if XAMCORE_4_0` with an `#if NET`?,0
@github maybe just an if statement inside that makes those changes ~ adds watch to the legacy and doesn't go though the platforms for the dotnet_iOS_MacCatalyst?,0

nit: extra new line,0
Oh okay yeah sure that makes sense!,0
Looks like Sebastien's test fails when these are removed so maybe they are needed:,0
perhaps 'duplicated'?,0
Thanks!,0
Enum value looks strange,0
You can add the iOS availability on enums and their individual values too.,0
"Automatic,",0
"AutomaticOutLine,",0
"Also just a small thing but add a comma after the AutomaticOutLine so that if anyone else ever adds something to your enum, their name won't show up in the blame and seem like they added that value. Great job! :)",0

"This one was having test failures that I was waiting on, but a new (weekly) version of the localization PRs came out which includes all the changes in this PR and more!",0
"OK, let's YOLO this 😁",0
Sounds good 😂,0
@github changes look good. Interestingly all the ignored enums and functions are in all platforms supported by the framework. There is an option to create a single ignore file that uses common-* as the prefix rather than the platform name. Food for though 😉,0
@github  Would you recommend that I change it to common? Would it still be okay in common if it doesn't cover watchOS also?,0
Flagging just in case since lowest supported is 10.14,0

"@github let me know if the json was tool generated, in that case ignore my comments.",0
Yes they were auto generated. The output used spaces instead of tabs though so it is possible that I messed up indentation when trying to use tabs to not show changes in Rolf's existing json,0
