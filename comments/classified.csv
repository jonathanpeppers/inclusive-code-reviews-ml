The failing test does not seem to be an issue caused directly by this PR,0,0.5
Further investigation reviled an existing issue with incremental builds when using #code AOT,0,0.5
Because #code AOT calls the #code task during the #code target it updates the assembly. The next build after than WILL cause #code to run because the #code are newer than the #code files,0,0.5
While #code doesn't run in that scenario (and does with this new code). I believe we should try to alter the code so that #code does NOT cause the next build to do work it doesn't not need to. So that should be fixed in a separate PR,0,0.5

@github we have a typo here,0,0.5

@github why did we need to change the order? Is the order important,0,0.5
I spoke with jonp about that. I think we should pick up any directBootAware. That means it will be forward compatible if google decide to add a new one. That said I need to also check the app element itself as well. I'll fix that up today,0,0.5
LibZipSharp has been setup to use #code see https://github.com/xamarin/LibZipSharp/blob/master/Native.cs#L414,0,0.5

interesting trick :),0,0.5
Should we remove this? What happens if we get an error which we are not expecting? This would then bubble up to MSBuild and give a horrible MSxxxx error. Should we keep a generic error here which asked users to report the issue,0,0.5

@github I just realised these tests need a device right,0,0.5
So they are in the wrong project. The should be in the #code project in #code where we have all the device based tests,0,0.5
It should also make use of the #code property and #code the test if we don't have any devices attached,0,0.5
For example https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/master/tests/MSBuildDeviceIntegration/Tests/InstallTests.cs#L233,0,0.5
I need to make changes to this anyway to make sure the new targets do not run as part of a DTB,0,0.5
You can confirm this by looking at the Ids in the Rtxt file contents https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/3025/files#diff-8649defe4caffc0b9f604d92c1ad8808R78. These ids were generated by aapt2 on the same resource structure. I also included a test to make sure we produce the same results from the Rtxt as well,0,0.5
This seems to work,0,0.5

On the other hand I'm wondering if a mix of two other ideas would make this idea more future-proof,0,0.5
1. Enhance the optimization that removes the null assignment to remove the Handle == IntPtr.Zero check as well. This would mean the only thing left in the Dispose method would be the call to base,0,0.5
2. Check if there is (or implement) an optimization in the linker (or our own custom steps) that removes virtual overrides that just call base,0,0.5
"This seems both safer/more defensive, and generally more useful (the second part at least, if it's not done already)",0,0.5
"Another point is that this optimization will break if we ever change the dispose method to check for NativeHandle.Zero instead of IntPtr.Zero, and there are no tests in this PR to catch this :)",0,0.5

This is an experiment to support Brotli compression in method contexts for SPMI collections,0,0.5

In total, we are building it separately 5 times (6 times if you include System.IO.Compression)",0,0.5

"Note that the time for collect includes the time for the collection itself, merging/cleaning, building the TOC and doing a test SPMI replay.

I have not bothered optimizing this but it would probably reduce the time taken for collections significantly",0,0.5
For the replay commands I invoked superpmi.exe directly with a checked JIT. For parallel runs I passed -p. I think the parallel HDD runs are so much faster because the smaller file means the OS keeps it in memory longer. It seems the striding we use with parallel runs is terrible for HDD performance,0,0.5

#NAME,0,0.5
"So doing that unsafe cast basically tricks the runtime into just calling the #code method of each actual handler just with an input #code type (as we don't know the type used in each handler here) - we're essentially invoking a contravariant delegate as if it was covariant in that input argument. Again this is always guaranteed to be a valid type cast due to how the messenger itself works - each recipient will always match the original #code constraint in each delegate being invoked. This way we get identical codegen to just invoking those handlers directly, even if we lack knowledge on each type in use",0,0.5

This would've meant to completely defeat the whole point of structuring delegates this way to allow the C# compiler to cache them (as they're static), as we would've had to allocate a new display class capturing the input delegate every single time one was registered. Also each broadcast would've had twice the number of virtual calls, as each handler would've had to go through its proxy one doing the recipient cast first",0,0.5
"This is something I've actually talked about quite a bit with @github and @github too in the C# Discord server. Given the exact specifications of this type and the way it's implemented, using this trick should be perfectly valid, as all the various constraints and unsafe casts will always be guaranteed to be valid, so there will never be a type violation in doing so. This is really just a workaround for a lack of proper support for basically doing the equivalent of ""try to invoke this delegate with these inputs, and just throw if they are not valid"". With the exception that here we already know the inputs are valid, so we don't even check",0,0.5
"In an ideal world (as in, with you guys having unlimited time and budget to implement all sorts of proposals even for less requested features), my idea was that #code could be implemented as a JIT intrinsic, with the EE engine emitting the code there to just do safe casts of the inputs and throw otherwise - that way all the reflection would be avoided and the resulting codegen would be almost the same as just #code, with the only difference being the checks for the input parameters and boxing of value type parameters, if any, but that'd be perfectly acceptable. This is just a way to achieve that with the current runtime 🚀",0,0.5

Without knowing the palette, there's nothing we can do about that",0,0.5

It appears that this hash code is being appended only when working with a default namespace. Which makes sense - keeping assemblies separate for different namespaces. The hash code is meant to be a predictable and persistent way to keep namespaces separated without having to append an entire namespace string in the assembly name which could be ugly at best and could run into more impactful issues at worst,0,0.5
"However, the original implementation fell into the trap of using String.GetHashCode() which was never meant to be persistent. In fact, it is not consistent across .Net Core and .Net 4.8. It isn't even consistent across 32 and 64-bit implementations of 4.8. String.GetHashCode() kind of worked by accident here, but was not really ever appropriate for the function it is performing here",0,0.5
Another thing to note is that generated assemblies do not really share between 4.8 and .Net Core due to netstandard.dll. So maintaining some resemblance with either 32-bit or 64-bit .Net 4.8 isn't much of a concern here,0,0.5
"So there is a bit of a ""green field"" opportunity to get this right this time. Criteria to note: We want something that produces a repeatable, persistent hash. The hash should be of reasonable length to avoid collision, but it is not required to be exactly 32-bits. Also, since this is not a hot code path where every bit of performance counts, we don't need to worry about being super fast. Finally, we're using this hash for naming purposes, not cryptographic purposes",0,0.5
"GetHashCode() meets all those criteria except for the most important - it's obviously not persistent. But rather than re-inventing an old wheel just because it feels familiar (although, this new wheel will not actually bring compatibility with the old cart)... lets use a tool that is proven and easily accessible.

"@github reordering them would certainly be a better choice, but it isn't trivial for me, as I'm no expert in the details of how the JIT really works. As the reverse p/invoke is added to the prolog/epilog in the flowgraph stage, and the inlined call frame logic is handled during lower; however, I'm not comfortable making such a change myself, as the fix looked to be more involved than I was prepared to handle, and prolog/epilog code is notoriously fussy to get right. That said, if this gets checked in in the current state, I'll open an issue against the JIT team to look at coming up with the more optimal fix. I've been able to get this to reproduce reliably by running the determinism test in a loop under jitstress1 mode, so verifying a more complex fix is not a difficult task",0,0.5
"@github Rare is possibly the wrong word.... possibly, less common would be a better term.

"I think you already had some sort of ""context"" object that was beginning to congeal.

"Is the debugger flag only being used to control whether we list completion items before their declaration point? And do completion providers get passed an OptionSet from the originating workspace (or can get at it)? If both are ""yes"", then perhaps we should instead have there be a not-UI-exposed completion option that simply specifies that debugger behavior, and the debugger workspace we create just sets that option explicitly. I could imagine people might actually like that behavior during real typing as well. It's not rare that you might write some code and realize you need to use a local declared farther down. Rather than me breaking context, moving the local up, and then writing the code again, that it's perhaps OK to actually complete it anyways. It's I am not saying we should expose it in a UI (at least not until customers come with pitchforks asking for it :smile:), but if they did come along and ask for that we'd implement that with an option. Given that also might fix this problem too, I can't help but notice the coincidence",0,0.5
