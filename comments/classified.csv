While #code doesn't run in that scenario (and does with this new code). I believe we should try to alter the code so that #code does NOT cause the next build to do work it doesn't not need to. So that should be fixed in a separate PR,0,0.5
I've changed this over to use #code,0,0.5
don't use log. here. it will lock up the UI thread (if someone decides to build in the UI),0,0.5
"You should add a reference to the Xamarin.AsyncTask Nuget, and derive from that. Then use the LogMessage overloaded methods to log any data. It will marshal stuff back to the UI thread correctly",0,0.5
Do we even need this since its not depending on #code anymore,0,0.5
@github we have a typo here,0,0.5
#code vs #code,0,0.5
I think we need to make this a LogCodedWarning if possible,0,0.5
@github why did we need to change the order? Is the order important,0,0.5
I spoke with jonp about that. I think we should pick up any directBootAware. That means it will be forward compatible if google decide to add a new one. That said I need to also check the app element itself as well. I'll fix that up today,0,0.5
LibZipSharp has been setup to use #code see #url,0,0.5
So it has to be in that directory. What other files do we have in x64,0,0.5
interesting trick :),0,0.5
Should we remove this? What happens if we get an error which we are not expecting? This would then bubble up to MSBuild and give a horrible MSxxxx error. Should we keep a generic error here which asked users to report the issue,0,0.5
"I did try, but shared projects do not seem to like the way we include stuff like the Linker code and the pdb stuff etc. It seems they don't like the items where we define a property for the path e.g.#code.  I will have another go",0,0.5

@github I took care of this on #url,0,0.5
I *think* (and @github can correct me :) ) we tend to prefer that we explicitly define the dependencies in,0,0.5
#code for .NET and #code for Legacy. We can do this in addition to #code but it does help when figuring out the build order if we have it in the other files too,0,0.5
This is for .NET 7+ only right,0,0.5
Also it makes it compatible with linux as well as that will look in #code by default (if it exists),0,0.5
is there a way to conditionally import this I wonder. So only if #code,0,0.5
can we add some inputs and outputs on this :),0,0.5
Order was not important. I just decided to put all the unit test adapters at the bottom,0,0.5
"@github this code path is only used for #code, #code and #code entries which are normally included in one of the Support Libraries. So we might have an attribute like",0,0.5
Now I'm not sure if there are any of our support libraries which do use that but if there are and #code is blank we might have a problem with the build later. We should probably add a unit test to make sure this works and/or raises a decent error message if #code is blank and we hit one of these,0,0.5
should this value be true,0,0.5

"silly question, but does this need to be net6.0? or can it be netstandard2.1",0,0.5
I think we need input from @github as to what the expected behaviour is in this instance,0,0.5

Oh and all the unit tests are going to have to change as well. Most are hardcoded to look for #code most of the time,0,0.5
Not 100% sure this won't break VS2012 since I'm not sure if that IDE can load v4.5.1 assemblies (afaik VS2012 was released before v4.5.1 was out... I'm happy to be wrong though :) ). It will need testing,0,0.5
Are we missing this file? I can't see it in the PR,0,0.5
The fix above was merged,0,0.5
does this need to be High? It means we will always how this regardless of the verbosity set.  We should be using Log.LogDebugMessage instead? This would mean it only shows up in diagnostic builds,0,0.5

"#code will also need MSBuild tests I think and MSBuildDevice. This folder contains the release/debug runtimes. I don't think the apk tests will test debug/fastdev at all, so we might not get good coverage just running those tests",0,0.5

So we should emit both then? I'll take a look at doing that,0,0.5
Hmm errors are,0,0.5
"yes something like #code or #code. That is was I was envisioned, so its all kinda self contained",0,0.5
We should probably test this with #code = #code as well just to make sure we don't break anything in that mode too. Since some users do disable it,0,0.5

I thought part of the problem was that nodes are reused? Won't this stop that from happening,0,0.5
@github I just realised these tests need a device right,0,0.5
So they are in the wrong project. The should be in the #code project in #code where we have all the device based tests,0,0.5
It should also make use of the #code property and #code the test if we don't have any devices attached,0,0.5
For example #url,0,0.5
I need to make changes to this anyway to make sure the new targets do not run as part of a DTB,0,0.5
You can confirm this by looking at the Ids in the Rtxt file contents #url. These ids were generated by aapt2 on the same resource structure. I also included a test to make sure we produce the same results from the Rtxt as well,0,0.5
This seems to work,0,0.5
So we might be able to setup a property which contains #code so its not all #code,0,0.5
nice :) I could have used this in #3938,0,0.5
"The #code target only calls build if we are running from the command line. In the IDE is does NOT call #code. Our tests run as if they are in the IDE, so a call to Build will be needed",0,0.5
"Conceptually, #code + #code feels ""weird"": it's inconsistent with other existing properties, such as #code, #code",0,0.5
Is there a reason to not go with #code (plural)? Is it easier for the IDE to have the two separate properties,0,0.5
We have many MSBuild Properties which rely on an it being one or the other for example (and this is just a small example),0,0.5

"As we talked about on the meeting, we could just make #code internal. So not something users would use, but it would be automatic if they are using .net 6 AND #code And #code",0,0.5

"my concern with inner builds are performance, the fact that we (in .net 6) have to do an inner build for each abi already, adding yet another one for packaging/signing, then in the future more for Dynamic Features. I'd rather avoid those if possible. But it might well be our only option",0,0.5

Then the [NoWatch] attribute on the other members added to this type is redundant,0,0.5

I have not bothered optimizing this but it would probably reduce the time taken for collections significantly",0,0.5
For the replay commands I invoked superpmi.exe directly with a checked JIT. For parallel runs I passed -p.

"- As you can see from the delegate, #code is always a reference type",0,0.5
"So doing that unsafe cast basically tricks the runtime into just calling the #code method of each actual handler just with an input #code type (as we don't know the type used in each handler here) - we're essentially invoking a contravariant delegate as if it was covariant in that input argument. Again this is always guaranteed to be a valid type cast due to how the messenger itself works - each recipient will always match the original #code constraint in each delegate being invoked. This way we get identical codegen to just invoking those handlers directly, even if we lack knowledge on each type in use",0,0.5

"- Use #code, which is just terrible for performance/memory usage. We wanted to have the broadcast method have an amortized allocation cost equal to 0, and also to avoid using reflection completely in this implementation",0,0.5
"- Wrap each input handler in another one with just an #code parameter. This would've meant to completely defeat the whole point of structuring delegates this way to allow the C# compiler to cache them (as they're static), as we would've had to allocate a new display class capturing the input delegate every single time one was registered. Also each broadcast would've had twice the number of virtual calls, as each handler would've had to go through its proxy one doing the recipient cast first",0,0.5
"This is something I've actually talked about quite a bit with @github and @github too in the C# Discord server. Given the exact specifications of this type and the way it's implemented, using this trick should be perfectly valid, as all the various constraints and unsafe casts will always be guaranteed to be valid, so there will never be a type violation in doing so. This is really just a workaround for a lack of proper support for basically doing the equivalent of ""try to invoke this delegate with these inputs, and just throw if they are not valid"". With the exception that here we already know the inputs are valid, so we don't even check",0,0.5
"In an ideal world (as in, with you guys having unlimited time and budget to implement all sorts of proposals even for less requested features), my idea was that #code could be implemented as a JIT intrinsic, with the EE engine emitting the code there to just do safe casts of the inputs and throw otherwise - that way all the reflection would be avoided and the resulting codegen would be almost the same as just #code, with the only difference being the checks for the input parameters and boxing of value type parameters, if any, but that'd be perfectly acceptable. This is just a way to achieve that with the current runtime 🚀",0,0.5

"which is unlike every other type in the default constructor which means simply writing #code **will not** work because you aren't explicitly trying to convert the number to the #code datatype which also still has a max value, 179769313486231570814527423731704356798070567525844996598917476803157260780028538760589558632766878171540458953514382464234321326889464182768467546703537516986049910576551282076245490090389328944075868508455133942304583236903222948165808559332123348274797826204144723168738177180919299881250404026184124858368, but it is large enough to handle most things, however, numbers will not get automatically converted to double type, they need to be explicitly defined with the ""d"" suffix like #code but as double still has it's limits, this still goes against the purpose of Bignteger since as soon as you do #code the double datatype will stop working. The biggest ""*inexplicitly defined type*"" would be the uLong type which has the highest value of a measly #code.

"2. Has limitations; it will not work when trying to define an actual ""arbitrarily large integer"" like tested  by multiple people in this Stack Overflow question (#url)",0,0.5
"So these constructors go against how BigInt is supposed to be by design, a datatype for *arbitrarily large integers* and having numbers too big for the base constructor goes against what BigInt is supposed to be. However, BigInt *can* handle these ""arbitrarily large integers"" and *can* handle infinitely large things with the parse method. The #code method takes string arguments so it is theoretically infinite there and works properly. So why have that as just a method? Why not turn that into a constructor? Isn't that just stupid to not have it as a constructor if it literally satisfies what BigInt is supposed to be when as it currently stands does not? You already have all of the code for the #code method so why not just use it? Just copy + paste, anyone can do this! If the #code method *does* work as intended and how BigInt is supposed to be but the constructors can't, why wouldn't you just add the #code method as a constructor for string overloads",0,0.5

Where can we get a concise description of where TemporaryArray<T> is believed to be better than our traditional builder,0,0.5
@github it should always be better when the array will have to store 4 or less items.  This is for two reasons,0,0.5
"1. the values are just stored on the stack, and no part of the TempArray will hit the heap",0,0.5
"2. there is no contention/garbage possibility around pooling.   this is because nothing is pulled (or returned) to a pool until you hit 5 elements.  This avoids those costs, as well as the (real) garbage cost that arises with pooling when concurrent returns happen and one returned item it overwritten by another returned item",0,0.5

It appears that this hash code is being appended only when working with a default namespace. Which makes sense - keeping assemblies separate for different namespaces. The hash code is meant to be a predictable and persistent way to keep namespaces separated without having to append an entire namespace string in the assembly name which could be ugly at best and could run into more impactful issues at worst,0,0.5
"However, the original implementation fell into the trap of using String.GetHashCode() which was never meant to be persistent. In fact, it is not consistent across .Net Core and .Net 4.8. It isn't even consistent across 32 and 64-bit implementations of 4.8. String.GetHashCode() kind of worked by accident here, but was not really ever appropriate for the function it is performing here",0,0.5
Another thing to note is that generated assemblies do not really share between 4.8 and .Net Core due to netstandard.dll. So maintaining some resemblance with either 32-bit or 64-bit .Net 4.8 isn't much of a concern here,0,0.5
"So there is a bit of a ""green field"" opportunity to get this right this time. Criteria to note: We want something that produces a repeatable, persistent hash. The hash should be of reasonable length to avoid collision, but it is not required to be exactly 32-bits. Also, since this is not a hot code path where every bit of performance counts, we don't need to worry about being super fast. Finally, we're using this hash for naming purposes, not cryptographic purposes",0,0.5
"GetHashCode() meets all those criteria except for the most important - it's obviously not persistent. But rather than re-inventing an old wheel just because it feels familiar (although, this new wheel will not actually bring compatibility with the old cart)... lets use a tool that is proven and easily accessible. Use a truncated SHA512 hash. You could truncate to 32-bits as done previously. Or maybe use Span/Guid to truncate and get 128-bits with nice formatting",0,0.5

"At one point we had an invoke icall with a generic ``#code`#codemono_wasm_invoke_js#codeeval#codeEM_ASM_INT#code`#code`#code`#code`#code`#code``, the overhead of looking up the string literal is nonzero (especially because it's not required to be interned), and not being able to pass arguments requires the caller to do unclean things like shove arguments into globals (which is not a cheap thing to do via the current API... you'd have to do SetObjectProperty per-argument.)",0,0.5
"My endgame for this is that we use source generators to create strongly-typed wrappers for specific methods (JS pinvoke, basically) that correctly and efficiently use this new icall under the hood. Later on those wrappers could transition to using dedicated JS and bypassing the icall machinery if necessary",0,0.5

For example, in this test, I'm Sleeping for a small certain amount of ms but I don't know for how much time the kernel actually sleeps because I don't really know how how precise Sleep is. Also, I'm probably measuring render time wrong because I only measure CPU time between the calls but maybe GPU calls are async (?). My code in that repo is probably very naive. Also, I'm not sure if the terms that I use are the right terms",0,0.5
"Anyway, on my sample program, I'm able to reduce input lag by sleeping a little bit before rendering and I don't know if that applies to the Microsoft Terminal as well because it is more complex (render time can vary)",0,0.5
It looks like the input lag is a tiny bit better with the Sleep but it's really hard to tell. I don't know how to measure input lag precisely,0,0.5
This is why I hesitated to remove the Sleep,0,0.5

"So I've never actually managed to get #code to fire when playing around with this. I'm pretty sure it fires when the observed vector has a #code performed on it.

If we're #code wouldn't we have already copied the selection at this point in #code,0,0.5
Yes and no,0,0.5
"Yes, because that covers the scenario of (1) create a mouse selection then (2) releasing the mouse button. The content immediately gets copied to your clipboard. When you right-click, you paste that content, so this code isn't called at all because we're not in ""quick edit mode""",0,0.5
"No, because ""quick edit mode"" is specifically when you add these steps to the scenario above... (3) shift+right to extend the selection a bit. Then, when you right-click, we already copied the wrong contents! We copied the data when you let go, not when you're right-clicking. So this extra code just detects when you've done step 3 and we need to copy the contents again",0,0.5
