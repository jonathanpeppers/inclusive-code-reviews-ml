Context: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables

We ran into a couple of issues when trying to start Android emulators
on machines with multiple Android SDKs installed.  Certain SDK
environment variables (e.g. `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`)
were set on these machines, pointing to a path that did not contain
the emulator system image that we had installed ourselves.

The use of the wrong Android SDK would cause errors:

	[emulator stdout] emulator:  Not a directory: C:\Android\android-sdk\system-images\android-29\default\x86_64\ (TaskId:5)

Fix this by updating the `<StartAndroidEmulator/>` task to set both
of the `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variables to
`$(AndroidSdkDirectory)`.

I am saying that the behavior as specified feels wrong to me.

Since this property doesn't have declared setter, the specified behavior (initialize the backing field) is reasonable. Because there isn't really other alternative with exception of disallowing this. The behavior would be reasonable for ```public int P { get => field; set; } = 5;``` because this is what the generated setter would do anyway.

However, the specified behavior (initialize the backing field) doesn't feel reasonable for this scenario:
```
public int AlwaysEven { get => field; set {field = value * 2} } = 5;
```

In the current implementation, there are three steps to insert a new class declaration

3. insert a new node

As I understood from the https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/23871 description, better to combine three steps into one to just replace a node with a function by class declaration. Maybe I'm wrong and need to do the following steps 

1. copy comment before (to change comment with a carriage return) and remove (to avoid comment duplication) previous original comment (I'm not sure, however, we can try to use `{ leadingTriviaOption: textChanges.LeadingTriviaOption.IncludeAll }` in `replaceNode`)
2. replace a node with function by a class declaration

Do `fourslash/server` tests require explicit changing comments to add carriage return symbols?

@github I think the ask on https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/8307 is for restoring `Position` when the value provided in `SetLength` (that changes Position to the arg. passed) fails, so if you try to write to a file by first checking how much space is left, the Writing should start from where it originally was:
```cs
using FileStream fs = File.Create($""E:/some_file.txt"");
bool success = false;
int size = 1000;

while (!success)
{
    try
    {
        fs.SetLength(size);

        int contentSize = size - fs.Position;
        byte[] content = GetContent(contentSize);

        fs.Write(content, 0, content.Length);
        success = true;
    }
    catch (IOException ex)
    {
        // Try with a smaller file size.
        size = (int)(size * 0.9);
    }
}
```
Assuming you have 900 bytes left. In the above example, the `Write` succeeds but an exception is thrown when `fs` is disposed, this is because Position will be at the end (900), since the SetLength call on the first iteration left the Position at 1000.

Am I understanding the problem wrong? 
Is this an issue that we should address? If not then we can close this PR. 

Also, I think that as a workaround you could save `Position` in a local variable and set it back after `SetLength`.

"Thanks, seems like there are actually several interesting aspects:
* if the current relop VN evaluates to a constant then than any dominating compare with the same outcome will match. Here we have false and false. When something like this happens we'll reach the wrong conclusions.
  * the existing optimization (which is not destructuring phis) seems vulnerable to this too. The case where the current compare has a known outcome without any consideration of dominating compares should likely be handled specially. There might be something upstream handling these cases already which is why this hasn't tripped anything up.
  * if we substitute in a phi value and we get a constant then the branch is partially redundant regardless of any dominating compare, for any pred that would bring in that phi value. We don't keep track of the correspondence between phis and pred BBs (indeed we don't even have a 1-1 correspondence) so we'd need to reconstruct this info somehow. 
  * phi inputs that lead to ambiguous outcomes may be partially redundant with a dominating compare (as was the intention of this PR) but again the resolution is only for those pred blocks that bring in that value. Other preds associated with other phis may have the same, the opposite, or an ambiguous outcome.
  * for the phi-destructuring we may need to disregard dominators with known-outcome VNs,  and/or else disregard the unreachable paths from those dominating compares. Here the path from BB01->BB03 is unreachable and so the phi value (j =2) is unrealizable.

So the upshot is that if we substitute in a phi we can either get:
* a known outcome -- branch is partially redundant along some paths regardless of dominator behavior
* an unknown outcome with matching dominator -- branch is partially redundant along some paths, behavior requires path analysis
* an unknown outcome

and we need to account for those paths and pass them down to the jump threader in some fashion; this will feed into the true/false/ambiguous preds detection done there."

"I'm not opposed to this change as this improves build time and also the confusion around what should I use when I have a single target framework in a project within the dotnet/runtime repository. The only concern that I have is that the only validation to avoid usage of these properties will be either a wrong compilation (which might drive people nuts to not understand why the right code is not compiled) or PR Review... but I guess it is fine and people can get use to using `TargetPlatformIdentifier`.

Also it is a bummer that to condition for properties we have to now use `[MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier` to get the `TPI` value, but for items we can directly access the `TPI` property. 

I think while this brings value, this will bring some confusion to the table as the `Targets*` properties are/where simpler as you didn't have to think much about when/where to use them vs now if I want to use it to condition a property I need to do a ""more"" complicated condition by calling an MSBuild function to get the TPI value. 

If we think it is more valuable to make the system a little bit more complex for contributors (which I think will take some time to adjust but pain will eventually be gone), I'll get an email prepared so that we can merge today but we also need to fix the current build failures."

> I wonder if we could use 'Number' and it's 64 bits to store the bits and only do some math when we need full sized BigInt.

I guess the idea is to do something like this:

```typescript
/// We pack 64-bit integers into the 64 bytes of a double
type PackedInt64 = number;

const doubleView = new Float64Array(1);
const int32View = new Int32Array(doubleView.buffer);

export function pack(lo: number, hi: number): PackedInt64 {
    int32View[0] = lo;
    int32View[1] = hi;
    return doubleView[0];
}

exort function getLo(value: PackedInt64): number {
    doubleView[0] = value;
    return int32View[0];
}

export function getHi(value: PackedInt64): number {
    doubleView[0] = value;
    return int32View[1];
}

export function toBigInt(value: PackedInt64): bigint {
    return BigInt(getLo(value)) + BigInt(getHi(value)) << BigInt(32);
}
```

And this works on Chrome:

```console
> let x = pack (12, 0xffffffff)
undefined
> x
NaN
> getLo(x)
12
> getHi(x)
-1
```

But not in Firefox because of [NaN boxing](https://brionv.com/log/2018/05/17/javascript-engine-internals-nan-boxing/):

    > let x = pack(12,0xffffffff)
    undefined 
    > x
    NaN
    > getLo(x)
    0
    > getHi(x)
    2146959360



Because they rewrite all NaNs into a canonical form, so `y = pack (1234, 0xffffffff)` will also have `getLo(y) == 0` and `getHi(y) == 2146959360`

> But that would be different math than in my use case, because we would store different bits. And different math to get `Number`.

I'm not sure if it's possible just using math - for int64 values that have a bit pattern of a NaN, I'm not sure how you would construct it just using math.

if I understand the role of ""containment"" right then vmovss must go away.

Alternatively, I tried to investigagate the lowering way and change **ContainCheckIntrinsic** method, but ended up with the IsContainableMemoryOp check is never true for Math.Min/Math.Max. The only option I had was marking both op's with SetRegOptional which doesn't seem right.

I would be so happy if you pushed me to the right direction :)

"My preferred API surface when smart wrappers is involved -- and this extends to WRL::ComPtr and all similar variants -- is this:

```
smart_wrapper_thing GetAThing(); // produce shared wrapper
thing GetAThing(); // produce dumb thing, see note 1
void TakeAThingOptional(thing*); // consume only -- non-owning and non-shared -- optional
void TakeAThing(thing&); // consume only -- non-owning and non-shared -- required
```

_Of course, ref vs pointer is a decision you can make for the specific type. `HKEY` is by nature optional._

Putting the `smart_wrapper` into the consuming contract forces the caller to have that type (bad) and implies some ownership semantics (dependent on the type).

(1) In general, a function that returns a smart wrapper is subject to the same restrictions as one that returns the thing directly (like `HKEY openWslRegKey`): it must ensure that if an exception is encountered before the smart wrapper is populated, it does not leak the resource. Registry functions don't _throw_, so the need for returning a smart wrapper is reduced. That makes `HKEY open...` _okay_ in my book so long as we make sure to cover the error conditions."

I meant `AreUpper32BitsZero` defaulting to `true` for any instruction with a ""supported format"" which deals with a 4-byte size: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/55129/files/f058b59c7eea2d743d728dc080613e8b6c710e61#diff-6b4e0f32449f2f144e05699f59f74415a564693637f643084a896dfbd081830dR313
```cpp
// Else rely on operation size.
return (id->idOpSize() == EA_4BYTE);
```

This is basically assuming that any instruction that has a 4BYTE op size zeroes the upper bits and this isn't strictly true for every instruction. I expect its mostly correct due to most machines having the VEX encoding and due to most GPR instructions on 64-bit zeroing the upper bits for the 32-bit version, but it would also be nice if we had this explicitly codified (such as via an instruction flag)."

"@github It ""looks wrong"" because it is peeking at characters offset from the `at` position.
Think of `_lineBufferOffset` as where we are in the source text.

     If Peek(at + i) <> chars(i - skip) Then Return False

"To be clear code bringing down the process is not my area of concern.  Code is always free to bring down the process and there is literally nothing we can do to prevent it.  Analyzer could decide for example to call `Environment.FailFast` and we are powerless to stop it.  This is understood and expected.  

What I am concerned about is whether the compiler needs to be hardened against exceptions that originate from the analyzer layer.  The compiler is not hardened against that and there is no intent to do so.  This change though is making it so the compiler needs to understand exceptions can happen and react appropriately.

"here's one idea: 

the part that gets confusing here is htat we're in instance methods computing new data, which we'll then use to create a totally new instance.   There's nothing per-se wrong with this.  But there's always this nagging concern in my head of: OMG, is he going to accidently mutate state of hte object.

I realize that's a somewhat silly concern as all the fields are readonly and Immutable objects.  But at teh same time, it still makes it a bit hard to reason about.

So a little suggestion i might have would be to call into some sort of static helper that computes all the new fields, and then construct the new value out of that.  Or, alternatively, have N static helpers that do nothing but interrogate the old data and return the new data for that particular field.  The top level algorithm is just:

```c#
var newXField = ComputeIncrementalUpdateToX(this.xField, args...)
var newYField = ComputeIncrementalUpdateToY(this.yField, args...)
...
return new Graph(new...);
```

This would also have hte added benefit of having each part of hte algorithm independent and easier to review.  Right now it's super hard to check to ensrue that you're not accidently using the wrong local vs. field in many of these sibling loops.

"Questions that came up today

- Jupyter can update outputs from a background Thread, after the cell has finished ""running"". To update outputs without a WorkspaceEdit they can create a dummy Task for that cell, we had discussed this possibility earlier, but it results in blinking the run state and execution order, so I can try to delay/debounce that or we can just live with it 
- The output methods on the Task are not correct for modifying outputs on other cells, need to be able to pass in an index
  - Jupyter only needs replaceOutputItems for modifying outputs on other cells, but do we want the full set of methods for setting outputs and output items on the Task's cell and other cells? This would be 8 in total.
- What is the right way to guarantee that edits will be applied? I added a method that applies edits without checking the model version, but this is wrong, because edits use an index that could be invalid. I think we just have to loop retrying to apply these from the EH. If edits used a URI instead of a cell index maybe it would work to just force apply the edit."
"The FD standard specifies `file://localhost/some/path` or `file:///some/path` but allows `file://some/path` for bug-compatiblity, if I recall the research from the other OSC 7 PR. I think `file://myhost/some/path` was messy, because if I recall correctly, the FD spec would be looking for `/myhost/some/path` on the local system (`file://` can only refer to local system file paths in the FD spec, so this falls into the back-compat processing) while on Windows, `file://myhost/some/path` means `\\myhost\some\path`, i.e. a UNC path using the hostname as the hostname.

Windows is happy with `file://localhost/C:/games` and `file:///C:/games` and takes them both as 'local' when asked via ""Run"".

So `file://WIN-DESKTOP-1/D:` would be very likely to be invalid, as I don't think a CIFS share can have `:` in its name. (I could be wrong. Either way, it's certainly not what the user intended).

I think my suggestion at the time was to receive a URL, and if the hostname was the local system name, replace it with `localhost` before letting any Windows APIs see it.

It all gets super-messy with WSL though, as `file://wsl$/Ubuntu/home/users` is the correct file URL for `/home/users` in the Ubuntu WSL instance, but there was definitely _strong_ objection to using `file:$(wslpath -m ${PWD})` to generate this, in favour of some magic at another level so that the WSL environment could ignore that it was in WSL when generating OSC 7."

"The more I read the Teams thread and the documentation for `AssemblyLoadContext` the more I think we should just go with the allow list approach here. Imagine if we built the allow list and then integrated it into `AnalyzerAssemblyLoader.ShouldLoad`. That makes the logic here a lot more simple, it's a simple `ShouldLoad` check to determine whose responsibility it is to load. 

The other reason comes down to the invariants around `AssemblyLoadContext`. Specifically [this one](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dependency-loading/understanding-assemblyloadcontext): 

> Be repeatable. A query for a specific dependency must always result in the same response. The same loaded dependency instance must be returned. This requirement is fundamental for cache consistency. For managed assemblies in particular, we're creating an Assembly cache. The cache key is a simple assembly name, AssemblyName.Name.

The current implementation is not going to meet that because it's using the runtime state of the default `AssemblyLoadContext` to determine the load behavior in the child one. As the runtime state evolves the answers in the child `AssemblyLoadContext` will change. Hence we violate this invariant. 

Sorry to go back and forth on this one. It wasn't until this morning where I was re-reading the thread, doing some experiments and re-reading the docs that I saw this invariant and realized we may be on the wrong path here."
"Can't quite tell, but it appears SendUnableToUpdateRuleSetNotification is going to pop a dialog, which means we need to have done TakeOwnership() on the original UIThreadOperationContext or we might end up with dialogs improperly stacked.

Press Ctrl+C to shut down._, since the application did not transit from starting to started state. I definitely think this can be made clearer by adding logging, as you suggest.

A few thoughts on your cache example:

1. I don't think it is unreasonable to ask the developer to check the state of the host (using `IHostApplicationLifetime`) here. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it is the one source of truth for the host's state. I understand that what I'm suggesting is a changed behavior. It would be interesting to know how common of a scenario it is to have code like that in combination with a call to `StopApplication` made in a hosted service. 
2. If we would throw on `_applicationLifetime.ApplicationStopping` instead of returning, the behavior changes from how it works today, as it is currently possible that all hosted services starts even though the application is instructed to stop.
3. A wild idea, that probably is not feasible:  It is possible to decorate the host's `IServiceProvider` so that if services are resolved from a not fully started host, it logs a warning before resolving the service, or perhaps it should not be possible to resolve services if the start is interrupted? This is probably overkill, and the logging from the incomplete start would probably suffice - just widening the solution space 😆 "

"We are leaving support for custom Promise return types for ES5 and earlier which do not have a global Promise, so we want to keep the same argument list. The default behavior now will be to use the Promise captured in the same scope as `__awaiter`. This is to avoid issues when creating closures in namespaces:

``` ts
// input.ts
export namespace x {
  var Promise = ""Not a Promise constructor."";
  async function f(): Promise { // references global Promise type
  }
}

// output.js
var __awaiter = ...; // captures global Promise here
export var x = (function (x) {
  var Promise = ""Not a Promise constructor.""; // local Promise var shadows global Promise
  function f() {
    // Before this change, we would capture Promise here, which would be the wrong Promise:
    // return __awaiter(this, void 0, Promise, function *() { });

    // After this change, we use the Promise captured at the top-level of the module.
    return __awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function *() { });
  }
})(x || (x = {}));

Sorry I merged something wrong and so GitHub automatically added you as a reviewer.
"I would ask for your apologies for the rant you’re about to read, but after 6 years and all the patience I can muster, I believe I’ve earned it.

The original issue and PR for this bug is about to celebrate it’s SEVENTH BIRTHDAY. Over that time Skye and I have expended **so much energy** trying to get this over the finish line. It is incredibly disappointing that there are so many at Microsoft *continuing* to get in the way of getting this done.

.NET Core was sold to us developers as a way to break from the past, and major releases were going to be places where breaking changes could be made. Yet for 6 years I’ve continued to hear excuse after excuse. To quote Yoda, “always with you it cannot be done.”

Had this been fixed with .NET Core 2 when I submitted the first PR, MAUI and the other platforms would have dealt with it when they were being built, and WPF would have been fixed when it was being migrated. But it was punted to .NET Core 3.

Then, after the PR was already accepted and integrated, I was told WPF was already late and had too many bugs to be able to get the work done in time for the .NET Core 3 release. Our work was held up because the WPF team over-promised and couldn’t get its act together. Victory was ripped away from us at the last possible second.

In the time since, instead of guiding people building new frameworks like MAUI towards making decisions that would allow this work to get done more easily, Microsoft finds time to invest in things like “Minimal APIs” that only marginally impact developers.

So you’ll have to forgive me if, after missing it in .NET Core 2, 3, 5, 6, AND 7, that maybe I don’t believe we’ll see it in .NET 8.

It’s cool though. Maybe we’ll see this get fixed by the time .NET 12 rolls around. In the meantime, I’ll just continue to wonder how anyone EVER let WPF get past a code review with exceptions being thrown in event handlers, and why it seems like the same people are being allowed to hold back amazing frameworks like Blazor from taking advantage of these features.

@github thank you so much for your efforts. I can only imagine the emotional toll that having your status as “.NET contributor” ripped away year after year after effing year has had on you. It sucks having so many people stand in the way of something so obviously broken."

Possible fix John added to that PR - [`29a835f` (#25587)](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/25587/commits/29a835f7a41ddccae69ad3e26f2b0f95c4053a8c)

Could this issue be the cause instead?"
"Anyone who wants to know ""what are these spans valid against"".  Right now we just say things like ""there is an error in document 'Foo.cs' at span 1-5"".  But that is lossy data.  Clients who get this data can't properly know if that span is accurate.  For example, if someone wanted to navigate there, it could put the caret in the wrong place.  

--

I would turn it around.  Right now we lose data, assuming that no one wants it.  But i think that's wrong.  I think people care greatly about the spans for diagnostics, especially knowing where they actually are.

Roslyn has been built hugely on hte non-lossy snapshot model of the world.  We don't have any other APIs that say things like ""here's data associated with some non-snapshot concept"".  i.e. we don't say ""here's the tree for this filename"" or ""here's the semantic model for this document id"".  We always associate data with a real snapshot so we know it is accurate, and also so we can appropriately map between snapshots in a cohesive manner."

"> I think the type should be inferred from the property itself down when generating a named constant but not the other way around. I just don't see how that's useful.

I have given two concrete examples of how i think it would be useful to some subsets of our customer base.  That is sufficient to me.  I see no reason to think that that pattern matching will not *commonly* be used for this case.  i.e. someone simply wants to deconstruct, and they just like explicit types.  As such, they will do ```X: type x, Y: type y, ...``` as the *norm* for how they deconstruct.  Inferring thusly what the types of X and Y are seems very sensible to me. 

In the case where we're wrong, the user fixes up the type.  That's the same with the type-inferred *already* today.  THis is 100% a heuristic-based approach to *guess* at what we think is the most reasonable thing to infer.  It's often wrong because the user intends something different.  That's ok."

"I made a compiler change to report the error on the base type instead of the deriving type declaration. I think this is better for a few reasons:
- It just seems better for clarity. If I see a squiggle on the base type, I immediately know where the problem is, but seeing a squiggle on the type declaration doesn't give me much of an idea as to what could be wrong. The problem is really with the base type, so why not make the location more specific to that?
- In case of a partial class, the current location might not even be at the same declaration. I don't think it's a good experience to show a squiggle for a problem that's in a completely different location.
- Other errors that have to do with invalid bases already report a location of the base itself, see below for `ERR_StaticDerivedFromNonObject`, `ERR_DuplicateInterfaceInBaseList` etc.

"we are calling GenTreeCast constructor:

and after that we call `CanonicalizeCastNode` to clear the flag in some cases, is it worth it?
One option is to do 
```
inline GenTreeCast* Compiler::gtNewCastNode(var_types typ, GenTree* op1, bool fromUnsigned, var_types castType)
{
  if (varTypeIsFloating(cast->CastOp())) { fromUnsigned = false; }

or add this logic to `GenTreeCast` constructor (note it will affect more cases then).

Often I set conditional breakpoints on flag values so I would prefer not to change it back and forth without a reason.

Have you tried to add `assert(!varTypeIsFloating(cast->CastOp() || !fromUnsigned)` and fix the callers who call it with wrong value of `bool fromUnsigned`?"
"> _If this was not explicitly discussed during the API review_

We did mention that Windows differentiates between a symlink to a file and a symlink to a directory, hence why we needed to have separate creation APIs for directories and for files.

> _having this check and subsequent throw requires processing in user code (try-catch)_

We want to throw an exception because we think it's safer to tell the user early that they are using the wrong API for creating a symlink to the desired target.

> _it can be argued that a link is almost always created in a situation where the target is well known. I can't even think of a scenario where someone creates a link without knowing anything about the target._

I would consider this an argument in favor of throwing to let the user know they are creating a symlink using the wrong API, especially since they know the file was either a file or a directory.

Here are a couple of examples of the `mklink` command with the wrong target.

"@github: I checked. The manifest is all good. The DAC signature in the packages that flow to upstream (zips, runtime packs, transport packs). The only place where it is unsigned it's in the CrossOSDiag package and its symbol package. Those used to be signed in the `prepare-artifacts` signing pass as they are a specially crafted package - it has assets built in several legs.

- One big question I had: In the post build plan, will symbols only be indexed after they've been signed at the top of staging?
  - If so, all intermediate repositories will have to fetch symbols manually for their failures. The use of cross OS diagnostics will also not work - all dumps will have to be debugged directly in that platform and downloading the DAC will be a manual process. darc could probably help here. This just warrants long documentation as current investigation of dumps will be heavily degraded.
  - If not, then we have issues signing here. Unless you can somehow - which I thought wasn't possible, but maybe I'm just wrong - we will need the cross OS artifacts to be signed before indexing at a minimum. And then we get to the same discussion as earlier of a public symbol server with unsigned assets. One thing we could do is use an interim symbol server that's not MSDL + SymWeb (either sleet - though we've had perf bottlenecks there - or AzDO artifact services)."
"@github 

> I was under the impression that the C# team was still promoting == null and != null as the preferred equality checking mechanism and that is null and is not null were more of a secondary thing

Think I'm not quite getting my point across. The C# team doesn't have any type of official position here (at least not that I'm aware of). Hence this isn't about conforming to some guidelines. Different teams make different choices about this. I personally love `is null` & `is object` but that's just me :smile:

My comments are mostly in response to this 

> If we had a fixer that targeted types that has user defined equality operators, it could potentially result in a much smaller PR

My read here is that you preferred the use of `is null` and variants applied only to types that have equality operators. If that interpretation is wrong I apologize. 

I feel like that approach though misses the point of embracing `is null`. That style is all about developers writing code that unambiguously operates as they intend around checking for `null` or the absence of it. The intent is to make it as simple as straight forward as possible. There is no need to go searching around for equality operators because `is null` has only one interpretation. If the only use is reserved for cases where equality operators exist then it really defeats the purpose of the change. 

> @github's recommendation seems viable. 

Indeed. If the runtime team wants to embrace `is null` as a style then that is a very reasonable way to approach it.

I think we can catch it if we turn on `runtimeTargets` for .NETFramework.  That will give us coverage for the runtime-specific scenario.  We might want to ignore any `runtimeTargets` that don't start with `win` (since we don't really care if someone who builds a .NETFramework project for RID = linux gets wrong asset).

The condition for the debugger tests was wrong so it is not running on Rolling.

Change the condition to install the windows certs to be based on platform rather than name suffix, that way it makes it more resilient for future additions and to be able to share the same template reference for windows and non windows if needed to add this platform to an existing template reference scenario.

In several cases, NullabilityInfoContext would return values which were
out of sync with the C# compiler's interpretation of the nullability
metadata. This fixes the following cases:
* The `NullablePublicOnly` attribute was not considered when analyzing
private constructor parameters.
* CodeAnalysis attributes on indexer properties were not recognized.
* CodeAnalysis attributes were not recognized in a `#nullable disabled`
context.
* Private value-typed members lacking nullable annotations were not
properly marked as nullable/notnull.
* Mixing CodeAnalysis attributes with opposite meanings (e. g.
`AllowNull` and `DisallowNull` produced the wrong result.
* Analysis of members inherited from generic base types did not
incorporate the nullable metadata associated with the inheritance.

Backport of #63814 to release/6.0

/cc @github

A 6.0 PR introduced a regression in the profiling APIs, where the ObjectsAllocatedByClass API was triggered by the wrong profiler keyword.

## Customer Impact
As it stands in 6.0 profilers cannot enable ObjectsAllocatedByClass without enabling object allocation callbacks, which is extremely expensive, perturbs the process, and is impossible to do on attach.

## Testing
Manual and automated tests

## Risk
Low, the fix is targeted to just the ObjectsAllocatedByClass API.

Fixes #68042

This is unfinished, but I'm leaving for vacation, so I wanted to share the current state of this effort.

## Problems with previous code
The previous conversion code is buggy. 
* It relies on false assumptions 
  * ""Round the input to a 15-digit integer. The R8 format has only 15 digits of precision, and we want to keep garbage digits out of the Decimal were making.""  This is an incorrect assumption, and the cause of the linked bug.
* It seems to have solved an off-by-one error in a hacky way 
  * `const uint DBLBIAS = 1022;` is conceptually incorrect; the exponent bias for `double` is `1023`
* It generally doesn't take advantage of a lot of functionality we now expose in `double` and `decimal`

## Summary of approach
This PR is a general refactor of the conversion code. The primary goal is to solve the reported bug, but secondarily make this process more efficient by reusing fast code we have written elsewhere. To achieve this, @github and I brainstormed reusing a section of the Dragon4 algorithm for `double` to `string` conversion, as printing a `double` already involves converting it to base 10.

To do this, I split up the code for the Dragon4 algorithm into two parts and added an additional API that allows `Decimal.DecCalc.cs` access to the first half of Dragon4. This API is structured to return everything `Decimal.DecCalc.cs` needs to construct a `decimal` representation of the original `double`.

## Status of the work
The rough draft of the approach is complete, and the original bug reported in #68042 is now fixed. Unfortunately, the logic does not seem to be holding up for all code paths, as there are a number of failing test cases in `DecimalTests.cs`. For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18474647/173167981-811fca87-1009-4a2f-afdf-bc2b5f0e2fa8.png)

I haven't had enough time to dive deep into what is causing these issues, but I'm adding GitHub comments to the logic that I think is shaky.

## What is left to do

* Fix the logic to handle all the failing edge cases
* Ensure we have proper test coverage
* (Possibly) perf analysis to see if borrowing from Dragon4 is giving the performance we are expecting
* If we determine this Dragon4 method is barking up the wrong tree, use another method @github and I have brainstormed. In my opinion, correctness and maintainability is more important than performance here. 
* Backport to previous versions of .NET?

The suppression on `System.Attribute` is wrong. Ran into this in #70201 where `EditorBrowsableAttributeTests.EqualsTest` is failing because we didn't generate any reflection metadata for the field. This proves beyond any doubt that even I can't write a correct trim warning suppression.

There's a difference between ""a field is kept"" and ""a field is accessible from reflection without issues"". The issue is more pronounced in Native AOT (where the field can be completely erased from reflection). The implementation of `Attribute.Equals` didn't see any fields on the attribute type because the static analysis didn't deem any of them necessary.

Fields (or methods) that are provably not visible from reflection without warnings are free to be optimized in any way by trimming (e.g. how we strip method parameter names in illink).

This fixes the suppression and replaces it with a more correct DAM on type.

"Regardless of which pattern we use, this code just seems wrong.  You're not always disposing the disposable.  That very much goes against how disposables are almost always used.  i.e. the way people normally intend disposables to be used is such that they're always disposed. i.e. in synchronous code we don't do:


```c#
var disposable = ...
code...
disposable.Dispose();
```

Because an exception/early-return wil prevent disposing.  Instead we either use a try/finally, or just a using-block.

This is one of the benefit of just using the built in language constructs.  this sort of mistake would have been immediately noticeable.  Someone would have seen the naked 'dispose' and said 'that should go in some sort of try/finally'.  When you hand roll your own deconstruction of async/await, it's very easy to get it wrong and to not actually provide the semantics that are wanted.

In this case, regardless of hte choice about aysnc/await or ContinueWith, we still need to likely ensure that we actually dispose our disposables."

Yes, it happens in the tests on CI. It's what I'm describing above. The connection `Dispose` propagation might be faster than the completion of `sendRequestContentTask`. Effectively bubbling up `HttpRequestException` instead of the one thrown by the content.

As I said, very similar thing happens in HTTP/2. There wasn't and isn't any hang problem, but sometimes the exception from abort is faster than completion of request sending task and we bubble up the ""wrong"" exception. This already exists, I just caught it with my new test.

@github Says:

> Hey Joao! I was following your work on https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/compare/joao/snap , isn't the core problem related to the incorrect path to gdk-pixbuf-2.0 on these platforms ? for 64 bit we always default to x86_64-linux-gnu https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/resources/linux/snap/electron-launch#L8 but the library is under /usr/lib/. Am i understanding the problem incorrectly ?

The actual problem is that Code should always use the gdk-pixbuf inside the snap. But by removing the env very early on (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/7d62a5b857e41d43e62bb6a17aa2fe6bd58019df) we hit the situation in which the About dialog reads the wrong env later on and looks up a path which doesn't exist in the snap, so ends up falling back to the OS. In Ubuntu this isn't a problem, but in other Linuxes the path doesn't exist.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/7d62a5b857e41d43e62bb6a17aa2fe6bd58019df must be reverted, but we still need to address spawning other processes (eg Firefox), that's what this PR does."

**Imitation of the system top border (this PR):**
- Done by Chromium and it looks like also Firefox and the thing that powers UWP apps (because they are affected by the same weird bugs, see below)
- Not perfect in this PR (see PR description)
- Must be updated if an OS update changes the behavior (like 1809 which removed accented borders when ""Title bars and window borders"" is disabled)
- No one seems to do it correctly when the accent color setting is disabled
  - Chrome (continues to paint the top border with the accent color even when the setting is disabled): ![Chrome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56923875/74543318-76a3b780-4f45-11ea-9fc6-d92b897ca197.png)
  - Firefox (no transparency, wrong color): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56923875/74544965-56c1c300-4f48-11ea-8d71-2c3166c9bd33.png)
  - UWP apps, the best imitation (have transparency ✔️ but the color isn't the exact same, really hard to notice): 
![UWP apps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56923875/74544728-ea46c400-4f47-11ea-8da7-973955451e94.png)
- BTW, weird bugs start happening once you starting switching between light/dark mode (I'm running 1903)
  - Settings app: ![UWP Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56923875/74543007-ee251700-4f44-11ea-888d-2de0bbc87ff3.png)
  - Firefox: ![Firefox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56923875/74543601-f03ba580-4f45-11ea-897e-f1f190af4b88.png)
- But you have to be looking really hard to notice any difference

**`DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea` + DWM API to force dark border (the original idea in the issue):**
- Solution used by explorer.exe (I think) when dark mode is enabled to not have a white border across the window like we have now
- Unofficial API = might break = must be updated if the API changes
- Probably wasn't made for that use case (of always enabling it to prevent the white border bug)"

"> Why's that? I actually thought a signed int was the right choice.

It's just... It kind of feels wrong to me at times. For instance your code does `std::min(r, 100)`, which is 100% exactly what I'd do myself. But shouldn't it be `std::clamp(r, 0, 100)`? Because if `r` was negative, the computation would result in a negative number and thus in a red value of `255` instead of `0`. We know it works, because `VTInt`s are never negative.
So I've been thinking whether it would make sense to make `VTInt` a `uint32_t` or maybe even a `uint16_t`. The former would contractually guarantee that negative numbers can't exist and the latter would even make it possible to freely convert it to both `uint32_t` or `int32_t` without any AuditCheck naggings. Hmm... 🤔
But it's not that important really...

> I've done some initial experiments with a LUT, and it's a big improvement for `ColorFromRGB100`, but in `ColorFromHLS` it actually seems somewhat slower.

Oh nice! I'm glad it works in practice! BTW here's a SO answer with a low-level HLS-RGB routine: https://stackoverflow.com/a/45450486
That post is [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) so we can easily use it here if we choose to do so. I think the last line is supposed to read `(r+m)<<16`, etc., which makes me question whether the code is correctly tested. But it does seem reasonable."

"I guess the `rsGetRsvdReg()` might be available, and you know that the instructions and addressing modes you're generating won't require it (in the emitter), but it kind of seems wrong, anyway. It seems like you should request another temp reg from LSRA and use that instead.

One reason why: ideally, we would be able to only allocate `rsGetRsvdReg()` if the size of the frame (and maximum local variable offset) required it. We haven't done that on arm64 because we have ""enough"" registers, so always reserving one didn't seem expensive.

this comment (and the next) are wrong
"This is a habit from C/C++, but it it's not a bad habit to have. Putting the constant on the left is called a ""Yoda conditional"" and in languages like C/C++ that don't present warnings on assignments in conditionals this prevents you from accidentally using `=` instead of `==`. It's not necessary in C#, but I think a lot of people will want to use the same style and since it isn't wrong to do so in C# I don't think we should go about changing it.

"Yeah, the socket limit should keep it sane as long as it's filtered by `sysctl`. It's anywhere we intend to walk the entirety that it becomes a very big problem and will need OS-specificity. `xinpcb` contains not only TCP and UDP but also SCTP and raw, so `kptr_t` becomes much more necessary.
I don't think we should change to a `long` here though; TCP/UDP is still defined as 65535 possible ports maximum. If we're seeing more than 65535, something else has probably gone wrong. ;)"
"`xinpcb` is correct. However as I mentioned above, on FreeBSD this might be incorrect and possibly problematic behavior as `xinpcb` _may_ be an `int64_t`. I think 'absolute correctness' here would be for `count` to be `sizeof(kptr_t)` and `kptr_t_alias count = (kptr_t)...` but I definitely could be wrong.
But `int32_t` isn't likely to break things, since this operates off `net.inet.udp.pcblist` and so should never exceed ~64511."
"This seems like a good approach assuming that the allocated byte count is reliable.

"> Could you please elaborate what exactly is wrong with copying the structure? 

We recently did a performance investigation which revealed a large number of allocations (10+GB) in calls to `MetadataTypeName.NamespaceSegments`. This is a lazily-computed value which is persisted to a mutable value type, so part of the investigation time involved determining if the code was operating on the ""original"" instance of this type or a copy (where the latter would fail to persist the lazily-computed value such that subsequent calls return the cached copy).

> What effect is this going to have?

An analyzer will report a warning if a copy of an instance of this type is made (as opposed to _moving_ the instance, which is safe). The attribute eliminates the need to perform the investigation described previously (in fact, the evaluation was actually performed by applying this attribute and seeing what happened).

Current usage of this type produced one true positive report from this analyzer, and zero false positives. The analyzer is good, but not perfect, so it is possible that some future use would report a false positive that needs to be suppressed or fixed."
"> However, this isn't necessarily the wrong choice. Crossgen2 does not use the IsSupported function call mechanism, but instead it performs speculative compilation assuming the processor intrinsic IS available which yields excellent performance for this case on Haswell and newer processors.

Do we have a rough percentage of CPUs that are Haswell or later that would justify whether or not this is actually worthwhile? If you go based off of the March 2020 Steam Hardware Survey: https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/

Then roughly 75% of reported CPUs support AVX2 (and would therefore have BMI1/BMI2/LZCNT, based on what Intel/AMD have shipped):
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10487869/80646078-f0b1eb80-8a20-11ea-8eed-568daf0f3d37.png)

This naturally doesn't take into account developer machines, server hardware, etc. But, if we are saying LZCNT is likely to be supported, then there is an equal number of AVX2/BMI1/BMI2 machines in the same boat and a greater number of AVX machines and we should likely consider what is a ""good baseline""."
">  Why are we trying to make LSP only depend on the features layer?

The main concern I have with this is that the editor layer needs an implementation for every editor (as I understand it, anyway). O# can't use it because of this today, and if we ever want Roslyn's LSP to be usable by things other than VS it will need to be independent of that layer. If my understanding of the layering concerns here is wrong, then do please let me know, as I could totally be wrong about my understanding of how our layering works."
"Yes, the JS would error at runtime. The JS decl emit differs because the original declaration of `A` isn't actually a class and a lot of our code in the checker for resolving base constructor types depends on it being a class, regardless of what the binder says. Its probably fine to have the decl emit be wrong here if we report an error when you subclass."
"If I understand this PR correctly, here's the current approach (please correct me if I'm wrong):

(1) Every time a RawValue is added, we also add the same value as an OriginalRawValue.
(2) On parse, we parse the RawValue and set the ParsedValues, then clear the RawValue (as today), but we leave the existing OriginalRawValue in place
(3) On add of a strongly-typed value to ParsedValues, we also add a new OriginalRawValue.

Question: What happens if a user modifies an existing ParsedValue? E.g. update a single-valued header, or remove an item from a multi-valued header. Seems like we are not handling this case.

Beyond that, I have two concerns with the current implementation:
(1) It increases the size of the header store by adding OriginalRawValues (as @github mentioned above)
(2) It adds overhead in the common case of setting strongly typed values, because we need to also store an OriginalRawValue whenever this happens (as I mentioned above)

I'd suggest the following changes:

First, I don't think we actually need OriginalRawValue. We can just keep RawValue around after parsing is done. We can know the RawValues have been parsed by the presence of Parsed and/or Invalid values and not re-parse the RawValues again once it's parsed.

Second, I think we can avoid the overhead of keeping the RawValue in sync with any changes the user makes to ParsedValue by simply clearing the RawValue if they make changes. We can then generate a new RawValue if/when they enumerate NonValidatedHeaders. This also fixes the update issue I mentioned above. 

In short, at a given time, a header is in one of these states:
(1) Just parsed values. E.g. user adds parsed values. We can generate a raw value from these when needed (we do this today anyway when enumerating).
(2) Just raw values. E.g. user adds raw values via TryAddWithoutValidation. If the user does something to cause parsing, then we parse and end up in state (3) below.
(3) Both parsed values and raw values. In this case, the parsed values and raw values are always guaranteed to be in sync. If the user modifies either, we discard the other and end up in state (1) or (2).

Thoughts?

Fixes: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/62218

## Customer Impact

When doing some refactoring on how we calculate assembly versions we accidentally removed a property that calculated the file version embedded into the assembly.  When an application is compiled as self-contained and bundled into an MSI file, upgrading from a previous (e.g. .NET 5) which can lead to this assembly missing on the installation location or the wrong assembly to be used.

## Testing

VIsual inspection of the assembly to make sure the file version is correct and higher than the ones in previous releases.

## Risk

Low, this is just changing the file version embedded into the assembly.

"> Why are we choosing to rewrite the key? Keys are entirely opaque to the framework - they may happen to look like .NET member accessors, but that doesn't mean we should arbitrarily transform them.

I think this is a reasonable argument for not adding this feature to System.Text.Json. However, based on the amount of feedback on the issue, this seems to be clearly the default behavior customers want from `ValidationProblemDetails.Errors` when using camelCased JSON properties.

The original issue mentioned nothing about the `DictionaryKeyPolicy`. To most people, the fact that the `ValidationProblemDetails.Errors` is a dictionary is merely an implementation detail. They just want the error keys to look like JSON member accessors. Later comments merely point out that a `DictionaryKeyPolicy` couldn't even be used to work around the current behavior.

I don't we should be using `DictionaryKeyPolicy` to gate this behavior especially if we're going to camelCase after every `.` meaning we're not really following any built-in `DictionaryKeyPolicy` to begin with. It would probably be better to continue to ignore the `DictionaryKeyPolicy` in here and gate this on the `PropertyNamingPolicy` instead. It might be *technically* wrong, but it behaves the way people want it to. That said, it would make this change more breaking.

```suggestion
#nullable enable
        public record RecordTypeOptions(string Color, int Length, string Foo);

"Because I like seeing multiple kindModifiers in the rest of the baseline updates, I'd lean toward using a Set...except that we don't target ES6 yet, so you'll have to use `const modifiers = createMap<true>()` to mimic a set, then `arrayFrom(modifiers.keys())` to get the keys.

"@github If we're talking about _`ambient`_ context and decorators, I think we can avoid the new variables and use the original expression., because _`ambient`_ elements are skipped in JavaScript files. Maybe I'm wrong and we need to use a temp variable to store _computed property name for _`ambient`_ context  too 

Do you prefer to have the output for non-ambient names like this 

```ts
function dec(klass, name) {}
const isSymbol = Symbol('isSymbol');
class Foo {
}
__decorate([
    dec,
    __metadata(""design:type"", Number)
], Foo.prototype, isSymbol, void 0);
```

instead of 

```ts
var _a;
function dec(klass, name) {}
const isSymbol = Symbol('isSymbol');
class Foo {
}
_a = isSymbol;
__decorate([
    dec,
    __metadata(""design:type"", Number)
], Foo.prototype, _a, void 0);
```

Need to check this case, maybe there are cases in which a temporary variable is required to store a member name.
"
"```ts
class C1 {
    /**
     * @github {A}
     */
    value;
}

class C2 extends C1 {
    /**
     * @github {A & B}
     */
    value;
}
```

We set properties from `C2` to `seen`,
```ts
Map({ value /* A & B */ })
```

then we iterate over all the properties of the base types. In this case, we only have one property `[value / * A * /]`.

```ts
!isPropertyIdenticalTo(existing /* value: A & B*/, prop /* A */)
```
props are not identical, so we drop value from `seen`, as a result, `seen` is empty. 
```ts
arrayFrom(seen.values()); // []
```

I found that we can filter properties based on property `parent`

```ts
class C1 {
    /**
     * @github {A}
     */
    value;
}

class C2 extends C1 {
}
```

```ts
const seen = Map({ value /* A */ })
```

```ts
const baseProps = [value /* A */ ]
```

if props / * existing / prop * / refer to the same `parent`, it can be inherited in the child class, then we compare with the identity. Maybe it is a completely wrong way and needs to use another one. In this case, I'm really sorry that you wasted time reviewing this PR., I'll close the PR later.

"@github , I am actually adding this check back.

It handles the following case:
Let's say we run this command multiple times without making any edits to the content of the file.

`<script type=""text/plain"">
  <p></p>
</script>`

First time, in the HTML tree corresponding to the document-root, there will have no children for the script tag and we would create one children.

Second time, in the HTML tree corresponding  to the document-root, there will be one child for the script tag (The one we added in previous step). If we dont have this check, we would add another child which would make script node having 2 children (which is incorrect)

Third time, in the HTML tree corresponding  to the document-root, there will be two children for the script tag (The one  previous step). if we dont have this check, we would add another child which would make script node having 2 children (which again is incorrect as it should have 1 children only)


So if the file is not edited, looks like there is some cached HTML tree that is returned and running this command more that 1 times would result in wrong HTML tree structure (a one that does not correspond to the text in the file).

So adding a 0 check to ensure that we don't add children to the script-node that has already been set up. Alternative approach is to clear the children array of script-node before setting up its subtree but that would again be not as performant as this check."

Given that it's subjective, we should aim for consistency. General C#/.NET naming guidelines suggest using full words rather than abbreviations, and that's the guideline we follow in the rest of Xamarin.Forms [1]. Keeping the terms consistent throughout the API makes them more discoverable - if I type ""horizontal"" into a search or Intellisense, ""CenterHorizontal"" will show up while ""CenterH"" will not. 

If folks want to find the API to deal with columns, they should be able to trust that we call them ""column"" everywhere; not ""column"" in some places and ""col"" in others. 

[1] We've probably gotten at least one property name wrong somewhere, but it's _mostly_ consistent.

"Was looking at this and thinking that even one minute probably isn't enough here. Seen CI have hiccups where threads stalled for considerable amounts of time in the past. 

This lead me to think about how this problem is approached elsewhere in our code base. Specifically how is `SpinWaitComplete` handled when called outside a `ForceComplete` method chain where there is an explicit `CancellationToken` to use. Found the following examples:

- `AliasSymbol.GetTarget`
- `SourceMemberContainerSymbol.GetMembersByNameSlow`

In these cases we always pass `default` for the `CancellationToken`. I think that is the approach we should take here. This means that well written code will behave correctly, even under extreme CPU load. While the current approach could exhibit incorrect behavior under extreme load. 

The upside is that when this is done wrong, if we make the mistake you mention, the code will deadlock and deadlocks are very easy to debug. :smile:

"There will be some hiccups when we migrate to Helix, complex system stuff will go wrong. I feel like it's invetible we'll hit a few periods where we want to flip away from Helix, go back to the old system while we work out the kinks and then flip back. 

Ideally there would just be a nice global variable we flip in the YML to achieve this. That though feels like it will make the scripts really awkward: double the queue information, lot more `if` in them to change how it works. Definitely would be hard to follow and a bit more up front work. 

At the same time the only other option for ""temporarily disable Helix"" is revert this change. This change is more than just flipping our infra to Helix, it's also changing how run tests work, changing how our scripts work, etc ... That could be done independently because they're all designed to work on Helix or without Helix. Wonder if we should do the following: 

1. Get this change to a point where we all agree and approve it. 
1. Do not commit this change 
1. Open two new PRs: one PR that contains everything but the YML changes and one that contains only the YML changes. Merge them in that order. 

Then if we do hit a bug where we need to temporarily disable Helix we would just be reverting the YML. That's probably more managable than all the other work that is coming along here.

"For my records here...

The weird crash I was experiencing in the middle `OpenConsole.exe` while testing off the handoffs from the operating system, especially from background tasks running out of things like Visual Studio, VS Code, and on login, were because there was TOO MUCH handoff occuring.

I had a torn state. My inbox console was doing the very aggressive handoff strategy, including in the case of connect of a second client. That's no bueno. The handoff happens just fine, but the `OpenConsole.exe` accepting the handoff doesn't have the process list table or other records of the already connected clients. Therefore when it eventually receives a disconnect message for them... it tries to look them up in its table and horks because it was the `conhost.exe` that accepted the initial connection, not the `OpenConsole.exe`.

I already solved this problem in https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/commit/1cf4fb180634333b24fb1cda2797e45c3d18490d by blocking handoff for attaches and for consoles that are already initialized the first time.

I'm putting my foot down that there's no half way state here right now. Either the inbox one, when it initially starts up, hands everything off and is done with the matter OR something goes wrong and the inbox one remains the console server for the remainder of that session. Otherwise there's this state and countless other state that would have to pass, and that's beyond the scope of what I'm trying to accomplish right now.

Also, technically, we probably should be having some opaque value stored in `CONSOLE_API_MSG.Descriptor.Process` instead of a `(ConsoleProcessHandle*)` so this would fail in a table-lookup sort of way not an access violation from a weird pointer dereference off of a foreign heap value. But I'm just going to put this over here...

"> The behaviour of 12 bit variants is to repeat the first digit at the end, e.g. rgb:123/456/789 becomes rgb:1231/4564/7897. This is done by caculating value / 0xfff * 0xffff.

I didn't see any unit tests for the 12 or 16-bit channel values, but I think this algorithm _description_ is wrong. For example, this turns `0x600` into `0x6005`, according to Windows' calculator.

The algorithm itself seems correct, it's the same thing `XcmsLRGB_RGB_ParseString` does to turn any number of digits into a 16-bit channel value. It's just the text that confused me.

That said, it looks like this never happens, because the colour parser ends up scaling _down_ to 8-bits-per-channel, rather than _up_ to 16-bits per channel.

I'm a bit suspicious of that scale-down algorithm too, as it appears to just be trimming the least-significant digits (it seems `scaleMultiplier` appearing in `scaleDivisor` cancels out?) For example, given `0x6fff`, it gets scaled down as `(0x6fff * 0x11 / (0x11 << 8))` => `0x6f`. I'd have expected `0x70` there. Scaling up those two possible values, again, we get 0x6f6f and 0x7070. That's a difference from the original of 0x90 and 0x71 respectively, suggesting that 0x70 was the more-correct value to scale down to.

That said, I'm basing this on rounding-to-nearest behaviour: if there's specific rules about scaling colour channel values down, I'm unaware of them. For example, I tried to invert the round-up rule above as `0x6fff * 0xff / 0xffff`, and that also comes out with `0x6f`. However, the same rule for `0x6f00` comes out with `0x6e`, while the algorithm in the code still gives `0x6f`. There's a good change this last thing was _not_ how one inverts that rule though, since in its native habitat, it only ever scales up."

"Yes. I have a list. The places that previously only handled RecordDeclarationSyntax are guarded (kind check or base type check). Some are guarded locally and are checked elsewhere (unreachable).
For the latter cases, I didn't see anything wrong with them. I could add assertions if you think that's useful.
An example is `ExpressionVariableFinder.VisitRecordDeclaration`.

It would be wrong to return `tempOptions` here?
"such assert won't stand nowadays, first because there are many cases where `dstIndType` is not integral, second because VN tries to handle GC heap and for it the type is always `TYP_REF`, so we could have `srcType = TYP_REF`, `dstIndType = TYP_DOUBLE`.

There are many cases where VN is potentially wrong and we uncover more of them by improving our optimizations but for now, the CQ benefits from it still outweigh potential undiscovered bugs from it.

"I know that this was here before, but it is wrong. The widening has to do proper sign-extension like what the regular invoke does (regular invoke does it using `InvokeUtil::CopyArg` method).

var arr = (int[,])ctor.Invoke(new object[] { (sbyte)-1, (sbyte)2, (sbyte)-3, (sbyte)4 });

"I don't think so. The entire idea of this is the call is a synchronous operation and the caller is blocked waiting for a response. Hangs here are bugs that need to be fix and if we timeout or throw then we risk disabling the code path and falling back to the managed impl.

I think this code is in the wrong place - you are likely walking more of the tree than you need. Wouldn't it be better to stop the walk at the very top of this function?
Having said that -- if we think doing this is not going to help those customers be successful (eg because we're not happy with the API) -- then I certainly am not arguing to do the wrong thing 😄  I think it would be better to sit on the problem until we feel confident we can do something useful.
"> Should it also have a general fallback at the bottom sort of like we give errorType when type checking?

It has a ""fallback"" already - emit the node as-is, which is used for _most_ typenodes. We only map away jsdoc-y typenodes here, cause printing them in not jsdoc is probably wrong. Namepath is even more special in that it doesn't even have emitter code, so actually just printed as an empty string."

- `testing-library__vue` is broken because `GetByRole` in `@github/dom` is overloaded and the `BoundFunction` type uses a conditional type with `infer` on a function type so it only picks one of the two overloads (which happens to be the wrong one for this case) (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/45937)

"@github, I don't really think that more details are all that useful, unfortunately, the real difficult details of what's wrong tend to be in unusual structure handling, which isn't actually well represented in the gc ref map in any case, except as an unfortunate side effect. From a crash dump of the assert it shouldn't be all that hard to find method that is being handled incorrectly, and then run that portion of the crossgen2 codebase to see what the argument layout engine is doing wrong. As I recall, the difficult bit of the investigations we did before was finding the exact method that had a problem reliably, and this should make that process much faster."

Why would jit produce all that code for structs instead of a GC allocate call like with reference types? I might be wrong but it tries to get size from runtime handle first? Isn't it known at jit time?
"Personally, I don't have strong feelings between `GetEntryPointModuleHandle`, `GetMainProgramHandle`, and `GetMainProgramLibraryHandle`.  I'll even square the triangle with `GetEntryPointLibraryHandle`.

I do have weak feelings, which produce a preference order.

* GetEntryPointModuleHandle: The entrypoint is a unique thing.  You can have multiple methods named Main, but only one is the actual entrypoint.
* GetEntryPointLibraryHandle: While I think of .netmodules before I think of any Windows-specific use of ""Module"", I'm happy to say ""library"" instead of ""module"" here.  Maybe I'm wrong and this is my top choice.
* GetMainProgramLibraryHandle: In addition to Main being a non-unique target, lowercase ""main"" is subjective.  If you wrote a thin exe that hosts a big worker library, you may think of the worker library as the ""main"" aspect of your program.  It's probably not a likely mistake, but I like precision.
* GetMainProgramHandle: This could be a method handle, a function pointer handle, a library handle, a process handle, ... anything.  I don't like how vague it is.  Though, given that the type is `NativeLibrary`, maybe it's OK, and maybe it's better than the longer version.

Now that I'm done, I think GetEntryPointLibraryHandle is, in fact, my probably weak top choice (it's, at most, ""barely strong"").  But I don't want to rewrite my narrative bullet points."

<hr />

Currently, when process Handle can't be opened for any reason (local machine case), `ProcessManager.IsProcessRunning` enumerates all processes in the system to ensure that no process with given Id exists. This enumeration implemented via `EnumProcesses` call which is very slow (~10ms) compared to good case when process exists and handle is successfully opened

I want to suggest some improvements to (mostly) get rid of this fallback to achieve better performance.

Main suggestion is assume that process doesn't exists when `OpenProcess` failed not due to lack of permissions (`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`).

But there are some special cases should be considered.

Handle to process couldn't be opened:

- for Idle processes (`id=0`) (`ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER`)
- for protected (e.g. csrss.exe) processes (`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`)
- any other cases when our process is limited? maybe there is something special on Nano Server or old/future versions of Windows (who knows?)

In these cases we could (1 OR 2 OR 3):

1. fall back to slow enumeration (looks like the safest way, cases when enumeration does happen don't seem to be common)
2. optimistically assume that process is still running (allows to fully remove enumeration for local machine, but who knows if any other corner cases exists)
3. other suggestions?

`System.Diagnostics.ProcessManager.OpenProcess` still assumes `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` means still running process. So second way doesn't look completely wrong.

What do you think, which way should be used? In this PR, I've implemented the first way, but it's not a problem to rewrite with second way if these optimistic assumptions are reasonable.

"This logic looks wrong to me. What happens if `isWithinBaseUriSpace(absoluteUri)` is false, `force` is false, and `replace` is true?

What I'd expect is: since this is an external navigation, the force param is irrelevant, and the `replace` flag means we should be calling `location.replace`.

What the logic appears to do is call `history.replaceState`, which won't produce a useful behavior because it's only doing HTML5-style client-side navigation and won't trigger an actual external page load.

Here's the full truth table I'd expect:

| isWithinBaseUriSpace(absoluteUri) | Force | Replace | Expected behavior |
| ------------- |-------------| -----| ---| 
| false | false | false | `location.href = url` (append external page load to history) |
| false | false | true | `location.replace` (replace with external page load on history) |
| false | true | false | `location.href = url` (append external page load to history) |
| false | true | true | `location.replace` (replace with external page load on history) |
| true | false | false | `performInternalNavigation(absoluteUri, false, false)` (calls `history.pushState`) |
| true | false | true | `performInternalNavigation(absoluteUri, false, true)` (calls `history.replaceState`) |
| true | true | false | `location.href = url` (append external page load to history) |
| true | true | true | `location.replace` (replace with external page load on history) |

Do you agree with this list? Could you check how it corresponds to the implementation? I think the only combination that's currently wrong is the one I mentioned at the top of this comment.

I suspect that before this PR, the logic here was already wrong in that it didn't handle `replace` without also `force`. That was OK before because it wasn't really proper public API. But since this is becoming proper public API now, we should make sure all the combinations of parameters work correctly."

However, the S.IO.Pipelines that's built into the aspnetcore shared framework is 5.0.0.0 and that's breaking crossgen since it can't find the 6.0.0.0 assembly.

The definition is (paraphrasing a bit) “ASI occurs just about any time the parser can’t understand the next token without inserting a semicolon first.” Which means, to truly tell whether a semicolon was necessary, you have to try parsing without it, and see if you get the same result. That’s why this function appears so strange, and why the chances that this misses an opportunity to delete a semicolon is _much_ higher than the chance that `isSemicolonInsertionContext` is wrong—that one essentially just enumerates the places where `parser.ts` parses an optional semicolon."

"Hi, I'm the reporter of this issue - thanks for the swift fix! I was really curious why this has been happening (because seemingly it didn't really look that much different from other code that has been working) and I got into reading this PR to see how it got fixed.

I'm obviously just a bystander and I lack *a lot* of context but understanding this fix probably would allow me to understand the TS compiler better. I'm wondering if you would be able to share a little bit more in-depth explanation behind this? I will totally understand if you won't have time for that though.

I suspect that `SymbolFlags.TypeAlias` checks if this is a `type` type and not the `interface` - does it mean that one could use the `interface` for `LibraryManagedAttributes`? I kinda assumed that this is not possible but maybe I was wrong - I can't quite check this quickly myself because this has not been yet released to the nightly channel.

This change later checks the `typeParameters.length >= 2` - this looks quite odd for me because the given code uses exactly 2 type parameters, so why this is even relevant for this fix? I would more expect that this piece of code would provide exactly as many type parameters as the `managedSym` accepts (up to 2 as no more will be ever provided). Shouldn't also maybe `JSX.LibraryManagedAttributes` with more than 2 type parameters result in an error since those extras won't ever be provided? And how ""fillMissingTypeArguments"" is relevant here for the ""top most"" `managedSym`? Will this fix the other case that I've mentioned (albeit without repro because I've concluded that the underlying issue is probably the same):
```ts
type LibraryManagedAttributes<C, P> = WithConditionalCSSProp<
  ReactJSXLibraryManagedAttributes<C, P>
>
```
This snippet is using both type parameters so I would expect that nothing is missing here but yet it doesn't work either.

I was wondering about an additional thing for quite a bit - maybe you could describe this shortly as well. What's the difference between `aliasTypeArguments` and `typeArguments`, between `symbol` and `aliasSymbol`, between `type` and `typeAlias`? 🤔 "
"Oops, wrong resource.

"I'm still not convinced the current behavior is best choice. We would throw exception on wrong type, but marshal null as false or zero. That's kind of consistent with JS native behavior.

Cons of current approach is that it's not consistent from if you think about `undefined` and `null` as different types.
Cons of throwing exception on `null` and `undefined` is that exceptions are very expensive."

"@github Thanks, I hadn't realized I had the wrong base. Rebased and ready for review!"
"It looks like making the synthesized record properties implicitly declared has negative consequences for completion. After thinking about it more I'm also not convinced it matches our other behavior. For instance, `get` accessors are not considered implicitly declared because they have some syntax associated with them. I think the same thing is true for record properties. That syntax is also associated with the primary constructor parameter, but I don't think it's wrong to consider the syntax as declaring both symbols.

I'll change `IsImplicitlyDeclared` for the properties back to what we have right now and we can think about changing it later if it's important. The accessors will remain implicitly declared because they really have no associated syntax."
"Some background on the change in this PR...

For a type `keyof { [K in X as Y]: ... }` we want to determine if it is correct to simplify to an instantiation of `Y` with `X` substituted for `K`. Let's say `X` is a union type `'a' | 'b' | 'c'`. Without simplification, the `keyof` operation becomes a union of three instantiations of `Y` with `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'` respectively substituted for `K`. We want to determine if it is correct to simplify to a single instantiation of `Y` with `'a' | 'b' | 'c'` substituted for `K`, which it will be when `Y` distributes over union types in `K`. A complication is that we can't always inspect every constituent of `Y` because it might be circular or infinitely expanding. So, for some types we can't easily provide an answer. However, unless we can prove otherwise, it is reasonable to assume that `Y` depends on `K` _in some way_, or else the entire construct is just a needlessly complicated way of writing just `Y`. 

With that in mind, the best approach is to not simplify unless we can definitely prove a type to be distributive. Originally the code was doing it the other way around (assuming distributive and attempting to prove otherwise), but that meant we'd get it wrong in cases where the analysis was incomplete."
"> Any way you can make those results more readable?

Well, I could hand-construct a table. That seems like a lot of work when BDN should be able to output something I could copy/paste directly.

I run BDN using (e.g., with ""runtime2"" as baseline build and ""runtime"" as diff):
```
pushd C:\gh\performance\src\benchmarks\micro

```

The `--join` option would seem tailor-made to put all the different results together, but BDN crashes when using it: https://github.com/dotnet/performance/issues/1855.

> Would be great if you could pick one or two regressions and try to figure out why it's slower.

And the big winner.

It's hard to compare base/diff perf numbers: are the branch predictions wrong/slow? Is the straight-line code more pipeline-able? Not sure how to figure this out... Need some Vtune magic probably."

Yes. Sorry, don't know how I ended up linking the wrong one."
"Thanks @github, I believe I have reached the stage where I have all CoreCLR tests working and some Mono tests too, there are just two remaining failure buckets I haven't yet managed to get my head around and I would definitely appreciate your help:

1) For the two arm64 test legs there's some problem with building the native components; the <code>gen-buildsys.sh</code> script claims the targeting architecture is wrong even though it does seem to get passed in the command-line argument.

2) For the two arm legs there's a configuration inconsistency - we're pulling down a debug version of the framework (just like in pre-existing PR runs without my change) but we seem to be expecting release during the LLVM AOT Compile CoreCLR tests step. Have you got any idea where we're supposed to be overriding the LibraryConfiguration property in this case? In the scripts it defaults to release and I haven't yet found out where we've been switching it over to Debug previously.

Thanks a lot

When enabling the globalization invariant mode on Linux, we'll always fallback to `UTC` time zone which is wrong and a regression from .NET 5.0. We have some docker containers which enable the globalization invariant mode by default on the whole image; the problem will be obvious there.

In .NET 6.0 we have introduced the [Globalization Invariant Mode Breaking Change](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/globalization/6.0/culture-creation-invariant-mode). This breaking change causes throwing exception when enabling the globalization invariant mode and creating any culture other than Invariant culture. 
If the globalization invariant mode is enabled and trying to get the local time zone when running on Linux platform, the creation process will try to initialize the display names of the time zone. This initialization tries to reset the UI culture to `en-US` if it is set to Invariant culture. When we have the globalization invariant mode is on, the UI culture will always be Invariant and cause the time zone initialization to fallback to `en-US` which will throw exception because it is not allowed to create any other cultures in the Invariant mode. We catch the exception and then fallback to use `UTC` time zone instead of the actual time zone set on the running machine.

The fix is simple and not risky which is avoid creating any culture during time zone initialization when the globalization invariant mode is on.

@github @github Looks like I was wrong about the llvmfullaot scenario. I don't have that working. Are there instructions on how to use it on Windows or macOS? I'm not even sure if I am compiling the runtime correctly so guidance here would be appreciated.
"@github Since I'm learning to work with the project, I got a question. Let's say you have a piece of code failing (like the assertion in the log). How do you run clr against this piece of code to debug what is wrong? I believe there must be a better way than just ""copy pasting"" the code into a simple ""Hello world"" project to emulate the behaviour.  Thank you in advance.

"> But there's something else: I think the existing fallback routing logic could still cause problems anyway for URLs ending in .<something>. I wonder if we should do something like re-processing the request as a navigation event if we fail to load an internal resource from the request URL (basically falling back to the host page if our initial guess was wrong). That way, users hopefully won't ever get the weird ""There was no content at _____"" page.

Hmm, it's unfortunate that Android's webview doesn't tell us the reason for the URL load event. WebView2 tells us whether or not it's a navigation, so we know unambiguously whether to use fallback logic or whether to regard it as a 404 if there's no match.

On Blazor WebAssembly/Server, we already have a strategy for dealing with not knowing whether it's a navigation: 

 * If a request matches some existing static content, we serve it
 * Otherwise, if it looks like a non-file (has no potential filename extension in the URL) we fall back on the index page
 * Otherwise, 404

It's not a perfect strategy as `/users/bob.gif` won't get the fallback when maybe you want it to (if that's meant to match `/users/{fullname}`). However people can customize this by editing their `Program.cs`. In practice, very few people have ever hit problems with this and complained about it.

> I think the big remaining question here is how we want to handle URLs that look like they point to internal files, but actually refer to pages. Do you have any thoughts on this @github @github?

(Merging the threads as these perhaps come down to the same question)

I'm definitely happy to give developers control over this. In fact I expect we'll *have to*, because otherwise they have no way to customize this equivalent to what's available for Blazor WebAssembly/Server (i.e., changing the routing config).

The bit I was most thrown off by was referring to loading `/content/file.pdf` as **external** navigation when it's clearly internal to the base href.

Is it possible that the underlying problem here is a matter of terminology? We have this event called `ExternalNavigationStarting`. What if we just passed the whole question on to the app developer by generalizing this to be about all navigations, both internal and external? If we fired an event on *every* URL load, we could preconfigure some `UrlLoadingEventArgs` with a property called `UrlLoadingStrategy` set to whatever our basic guess is (e.g., load internally if an only if it's within the base href - and perhaps in the WebView2 case we take account of whether it's a navigation event since we have that info), then developers can add a handler to customize the logic any way they like for both internal and external loads. Developers who want to override the behavior for a specific subset of URL patterns can match those patterns in their handler, and for all other URLs, leave the preconfigured behavior unchanged.

Does this make sense? Am I up-to-date with all this, or was this already considered before?"
"Reversing a list is not the correct solution. It means that some part of the system is using the wrong representation and possibly exposing it to extensibility. "
"> It's not going to fail if the string is wrong, right? It just won't light up the fixed behavior until you're running on a runtime with the updated OS platform string.

That'd be my understanding, it won't fail, it just won't do anything until the corresponding change is made. I'll make the change"
This seems wrong

"Actually, I reviewed that and initially I was confused by how the `EndpointMetadataApiDescriptionProvider` works but after taking a closer look to it I am confident that my convention is wrong and should be removed. We will be able to do something like this when Results type are self-describing."
"Exactly. You are right and I was wrong.
@github Had added MapGroup(https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/41265) pre conditions with param names and I continued the same."
"We were losing ref-ness here, so the conditions for these errors were not even detected. 
Considering this is an error scenario overall, I am not sure if these errors should be reported, but they were not reported originally for a wrong reason - we were not detecting them at all. 
Now the errors are produced as a byproduct of the binding. Whether these errors should be reported or dropped is a separate question and not a part of this fix IMO.

">This always ends up being parsed as a BinaryExpression, as when a generic type declaration cannot be parsed correctly, it seems we parse ```<``` as Less Than.

>I can't think of any cases where we would parse an expression type as type syntax which would contain an invalid dimension other than an ArrayTypeSyntax.

Can one create such a tree manually by using SyntaxFactory? Also, I might be wrong, but I think with the recent changes to the parser an element type of the array type could be a nullable array type with sizes as well. Also, since we are going to do the collection of misplaced sizes for other contexts too, and in those contexts parser's behavior around handling of ```<``` might be slightly different, or it might change in the future, I think it would be more robust to create a helper that doesn't make any assumption on how the parser works, simply visits the syntax (by using a syntax visitor) and collects all size expressions from array types in the syntax.

For this scenario, the diagnostic should be improved to explain what is wrong in a way the people can understand. Please, either ad a PROTOTYPE comment or open an issue for this.

Was this approach wrong for the AdvSimd case?
"Those directions are wrong now for .NET 3.x and above.  SOS is shipped out of band, not part of the runtime anymore but is automatically loaded from the extension gallery for recent internal windbg versions."
"This is an interesting style of iterator, but I looked it up and confirmed to myself that you're not crazy."
"My gut tells me the interface would be good _now_, but bad _in the future_. As we implement UI-driven features that diverge from the representation in the settings model (which we _will_, make no mistake), we'll have to add things to this idl manually anyway.

_Already_, this is incorrect. We should move the bindable enum stuff up to the ViewModel because _it's a viewmodel of an enum value_, and make the active values in the ProfileViewModel use EnumEntries for enum fields. Much of the logic that is in the Profiles page CodeBehind should be here.

This is just a start, and I think doing the interface thing would take us on the wrong path. What do you think?"
"To be honest, I don't remember why I added that check for '_' there. It looks wrong. Thanks for the fix @github !"
"Could you fix the grammar here? Was wrong before of course. (""XPath failed to match any 
```suggestion
    <value>XPath failed to match any elements</value>
```"
"I thought of some `TextEditorSelectionChangeKind` too, but that might give the wrong impression that the enum is exhaustive.

```ts
enum TextEditorSelectionChangeKind {
    Undo,
    Redo,
    Other // or unknown
}
```

Then users can check for `if (event.changeKind === TextEditorSelectionChangeKind.Other)`.
If there ever will be the variant `typeInput` (or `remoteEdit`), that would break extensions.
Another boolean flag `isTypeInput: boolean` would not break extensions though, as they cannot really depend on its non-presence.

Alternatively, the enum has no `Other` variant but is stored in a field that can be undefined.
But then users could check if that field is undefined."
"I wonder what the right thing to do is in that situation. Right now it would report on all of them if they mismatch (or some subset), but maybe that's wrong? "
"You know this is actually wrong. I just remembered the real reason:
While the D2D-based DxEngine only draws what needs to be drawn, the D3D-shader-based AtlasEngine needs to do alpha blending with the VT foreground and background colors for all pixels. If you don't enable alpha explicitly in WT (which breaks conhost support and thus isn't neabled by default) then AtlasEngine will draw everything opaque."
"This is actually the way I had it initially, but it felt wrong to me hanging on to the pointer like that. I wasn't particularly happy with the current solution either, so I don't mind changing it back if that's what you prefer.

The other option I considered was using a `reinterpret_cast` to get the `OutputStateMachineEngine` from the `_stateMachine`, and from there you can easily get the dispatcher. Something like this:

    auto& engine = reinterpret_cast<OutputStateMachineEngine&>(_stateMachine->Engine());
    engine.Dispatch().SetCursorStyle(cursorStyle);

I like that it doesn't require storing any additional members, but the `reinterpret_cast` seems dodgy to me. I'm not sure that's valid, but we are using that exact pattern elsewhere in the code.

As for holding on to the pointer and just giving the `OutputStateMachineEngine` a reference, I considered that too, but we're instantiating `OutputStateMachineEngine` in a whole lot of places, and having to update all of them seemed like a lot of work. Maybe I'm just being lazy though.

But as I say, I'm happy to go with whichever option you prefer, because I can't make up my mind one way or the other. I just wanted to bring up that `reinterpret_cast` idea first in case you like it."
"I wouldn't have thought so. Obviously the destructor itself is going to be using the object while it is being destructed, so I don't see why it should be any different for other methods. It's just not something that can be relied on in general, because a destructor may be busy cleaning up resources that the other methods depend on. But that's not the case here.

I may be wrong though. I'm not an expert on the standard. Do you have a reference to somewhere that documents this as undefined behavior? If necessary we could always call the `Lock` method manually before the destructor is reached - that's just a bit messier."
"Given that we're immediately returning, there is no ""context"" to this message. *Anything* could cause it.  Additionally, this message looks very similar to the `GetModuleFileName failed` message, meaning *I* will get confused when trying to deduce what went wrong. :-)

The messages should thus be updated to mention what's happening, e.g.

```cpp
log_warn (LOG_DEFAULT, ""Unable to get filename to `libmono-android.debug.dll`; GetModuleFileName returned %d\n"", ret);
```"
"IIRC, the trick was that the renderer->NotifyScroll was accumulating the delta into the psrSelectionRects, and that overflow was what caused the original bug. If there's no selection, then there's no selection rects in the renderer to accumulate the delta into.

(variable names might be wrong here)"
"> Are we testing behavior for this case?

Could we get in trouble by referring to ""wrong"" parameters? Perhaps with getting additional confusing diagnostics, etc. 
"
"> afaik it's possible to determine statically.

We can determine if a cycle is *possible*. We speculate that in some situations where a cycle is possible it will be irritating to warn the user on the basis of the declaration alone. For example, if a mutable record field is of an 'object' or interface type, the value in the field could be some record that leads back to the original record, and we stack overflow.

We are considering several possible strategies for how to warn on a cyclic record, since ideally we would deliver something which is a warning by default in new .NET projects, and would strongly prefer that the warnings occur only in ""something is definitely wrong"" scenarios.

We also don't have to worry about derived records as much with this strategy. For example, a derived record doesn't need to insert a potentially ""redundant"" call to EnsureSufficientExecutionStack, and it doesn't need to be suspicious that at runtime its base class may contain different private fields than it did at compile time, for example. It can simply assume that its base record derived from object does the check.

"> Yes, `dsymutil` works on fat executables. My mistake again : I thought that the AOT compiler stripped the symbols afterward from the output, but it actually doesn't. Xamarin.Mac doesn't seem to strip those executables (I actually do on my own projects with an extra MSBuild task). I'll change it to use `dsymutil` instead, it should simplify that code quite a bit.

And turns out I was wrong on this one as well, I tried with `CreateDsym` from the content of the lipo-ed file and turns out there is no debug section in those files, it's all in the dsym. Since I already need that logic for the main executable dSYM, I'll write a common function for merging multiple abi dsyms and use that in both locations"
"I looked at that too and after pondering for few minutes I came to the conclusion that it was intentional and the generated `xammac_setup` method is called somewhere... Well, perhaps a wrong conclusion on my part :-)"
"Rather than keep doing this in a loop unnecessarily, why not set the `_tokenType` field outside the loop after `reader.Read()` returns false? Does that give the wrong value?"
"> The .lastrun files are wiped out on a git clean so xliff-tasks complains about translations being out of date even when they aren't.

No, that's not quite right. The .lastrun files are used to know if the xliff-tasks should check if the translations are out of date, it doesn't determine if the translations actually are out of date.

Looking at the source for xliff-tasks, when they check if a translation is out of date, they actually compare the documents: https://github.com/dotnet/xliff-tasks/blob/cc53f75b404500236364694ff514dcdee2427a94/src/XliffTasks/Model/XlfDocument.cs#L68-L200, but something obviously goes wrong and then that function says that the translation should be updated when it wasn't (because when you run with `/t:UpdateXlfOnBuild` no files are actually modified).

This looks like a bug in the xliff-tasks, I suggest trying to create a small test case and report it to them (or use the small test case to track down the bug in xliff-tasks and just fix it)."
"1. This is my theory: I think recently CLR assembly resolution seems to have undergone a change in that unhandled exceptions from custom assembly resolvers are not masked and go unhandled. When we moved to a new baseline drop with .NET 4.6 recently, we started seeing exceptions in custom assembly resolver in our Tao StartTargetAction (see our TFS changeset 1394695 and 1408896). The prior code was obviously wrong and would have thrown for both cases that were fixed, but it seemed this exception never showed up, and a subsequent resolver resolved the assembly. My _guess_ is before v4.6, CLR was catching the exceptions from custom assembly resolvers while trying to load these assemblies and moving ahead with next resolver to attempt resolution, but now it doesn't (at least not for Load in no context). Someone from CLR team should confirm though.
2. IDE scenario: In the IDE we never seemed to be getting a callback for the satellite assembly. I debugged through the CLR assembly resolution and it seems to be taking a different code path for IDE and command line scenarios (IDE: _http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/reflection/assembly.cs,3012_ while in command line case: _http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/reflection/assembly.cs,3028_ , the later one seems to call custom resolvers and former bails out without event doing so). It seems to be taking different paths on Assembly.CodeBase value, which I am not sure makes any sense for Load in no context. I am not going to dig further into this, but my best guess is Load in no context comes with its own adventures :)
"
"Purpose of removing the entry once found `count `will be zero is to avoid every further check in future count value check: so that for same value, only checking `Unsafe.IsNullRef(ref count)` will be enough.
Also I feel it is unnecessary to calculate `count` to negative value by `count--` in condition statement.

Although it uses more code, but seems during runtime, it runs shortly. Correct me if wrong, thanks."
"Yes. I tried dropping errors from arguments and it becomes really hard to figure what went wrong and what action to take to fix the error.

"I would say that this is the wrong span to error on. Either error on the comma, or the parameter itself."
"Ahh.... But a generator _is_ a function type. You call it and get back an iterator, just like how you call an async function and get a promise. This error is straight wrong, then."
"If we don't specify the value explicitly then we will try to run the command inside `MyWorkingDirectory()` directory. This scenario holds true only when called from csx files. 

In short, both calling `InitUtilities()` from within library and not setting the value of _workingDirectory are wrong. The correct approach is to always provide the directory to run the command if it is run outside of the context of csx.
"
"The runtime doesn't mind the ordering of the modifiers.

`SuppressGCTransition, MemberFunction` is treated the same as `MemberFunction, SuppressGCTransition`. We should make them compare the same.

I would really just do the dumb thing with `O(n^2)` complexity I suggested in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/70105#discussion_r887623570 and for each modopt on the left side, check if the modopt exists on the right side. And make sure the count of interesting modopts is the same."

"I wrote a test case to to set the branch where `nullishCoalescingOp` is true.  However, that case seemed to be routed first through  `narrowTypeByOptionality` and never ended up calling `narrowTypeByCallExpression`.  From a software design perspective, that seems wrong in the sense that it makes it harder to verify and maintain the code.   However, the result of the test case was correct - ""working as intended"".  For now I'm leaving this untested branch in here as is - perhaps it would be better to code an  excepting assertion that `nullishCoalescingOp` is false?  @github what do you think?"
Ok.  I looked through this all.  Seems like nothing crazy is going on.  Note sure waht the long term plan is for all these `2` types is though.  But i think @github and @github will have to look since they understand this stuff better.
"`dotnet.exe` is manifested to support Windows 10, so if someone is using `dotnet app.dll` or `dotnet run`, Environment.OSVersion is already going to return the same value this will.  Same goes if they've added an appropriate manifest to their app.

I believe your concerns are the same as David's, and as this is a major release of .NET, even if it is technically breaking, I think it's the right trade-off.

A ton of code is doing its own P/Invoke to get a better version, since the version that Environment.OSVersion returns is often either wrong or inconsistent based on how the app is run.  We already use RtlGetVersion in RuntimeInformation:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/0d19a5e18a988ad52ca0c2907edeb40ba4e00d9b/src/libraries/System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation/src/System/Runtime/InteropServices/RuntimeInformation/RuntimeInformation.Windows.cs#L22
.NET Framework's mscorlib uses it:
https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/microsoft/win32/win32native.cs,2798
Windows Forms uses it:
https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/084afd290719163557de1b78d85ade45c3aa0e59/src/System.Windows.Forms.Primitives/src/System/Windows/Forms/Internals/OsVersion.cs#L19
A bazillion uses of it show up in arbitrary code on GitHub:
https://github.com/search?l=C%23&q=RtlGetVersion&type=Code
Even our public samples use it:
https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/37399bc2175cc253e83bd2d7b2a66e613daad38a/src/MusicStore/samples/MusicStore/Platform.cs#L43
I think it's much better if we just fix Environment.OSVersion to actually be meaningful."
"> could you present a potential future scenario that you're worried about that would break this?

The cost is on maintainability. Anyone who has to maintain this now needs to hold all this complexity in their head and get things right on framework/core for any changes here in the future. That added complexity is more chance to get things wrong and to introduce subtle issues (like potential corruption). "
@github @github I think String.Format benchmarks are also need to be included as it's one of the most useful cases for this optimization. This PR might bring string.format to almost allocation free behaviour as we have a thread-static string builder (of 256 chars avg I believe). And we have to track perf difference for this scenario. Or am I wrong and it only works when builder is resizing?
"@github 
> What is the type of `value`?

```ts
{ bar: 1 }
```
It's not a postfix to change the type, it's a postfix to *validate* the type. It's making sure whatever value is there has a type which, in this case, is assignable to `Foo`

*I'm pretty sure there's some other stuff going on with like, turning parts of the value's type into the type in `satisfies` via contextual typing, most likely exclusively in cases that don't widen it. I might be wrong on that front though? That's stuff I don't really understand besides how to use it haha"

"cc @github/jit-contrib PTAL @github 

@github this is practically just your fix, but generalized to any small typed local (for normalize-on-store locals it is necessary too). I think the problem in your PR was just the `genActualType(lclVar) != genActualType(op2)` check, which is always true in this case.

For normalize-on-load locals it seems kind of arbitrary whether we even do this on the creation of the assertion, and it might seem better to do this when using the assertion instead (the ""load""). But since the home of normalize-on-load locals cannot even fit the upper part of the values it seems kind of wrong to leave those bits in the created assertion, so I just went with always doing this when the assertions are created. This would be more complex if we tried doing assertion prop for mismatched accesses of these locals, but we bail on that quite early."

@github I grabbed a recent alpine image from https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-buildtools-prereqs-docker but it doesn't seem to be working here, any idea what might be wrong?"
not sure what you mean? it is all divide. doesn't matter where parentheses are. :) actually wrong. parantheses matter :)
"This shouldn't be here, since this layer isn't consuming UI.Wpf...right? Unless there's something else wrong?"
"@github Is the following message is the reason for the failure or there is something wrong with the PR itself?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31348972/85203473-6eea8a00-b30e-11ea-8bb3-13bc6fce6d28.png)

"
"@github I think it is hard to keep track of the current state of the PR for you. So I tried to collect what is done/missing or needs review/design.

### General

#### Sorting

Sorting is done via the magical `SortingPrefix = ""\uFFFD""` followed by `abstract int SortingGroupIndex` to make sure:
* The items are below other SymbolCompletionItems
* Conversions, Operators, and Indexers are kept together

I have not found any other mechanism for the sorting of the completion items, but using the `SortingPrefix` feels wrong to me.
✔️ Accepted https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#issuecomment-702265486

Do we need to have a test in place to make sure operator/indexer/conversions are between normal members and ""Add using"" (see https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#pullrequestreview-495669239)
✔️ 9d94034c

#### Broken syntax trees

`IRecommenderService`, which provides the methods/properties for completion, handles (probably lots of) corner cases to find the right `container` to look up the symbols. How far should we go to mimic that behavior?
See https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#pullrequestreview-495669239
🔜 

#### String manipulation in `GetChangesAsync`

Needs review. Your markers:
https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496120383
https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496118056
https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r493840482

### Conversion

#### General

Conversions can be defined either on the source type or the target type. We only show the conversions defined on the source type, so the conversions list may not be complete. I did so because otherwise, all types (in scope) need to be searched for a fitting conversion. Test case:

https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/3b4e1aa7ff61500ae4c78f06ddf01c3d4250530e/src/EditorFeatures/CSharpTest/Completion/CompletionProviders/ConversionCompletionProviderTests.cs#L274-L294
✔️ Accepted. Keep as is.

#### Nullable lifting and conditional access

I added support for nullable lifting (`Nullable<int>` -> `Nullable<byte>`) and conditional access `c?.Id -> ((int?)c.Id)`. The related discussion can be found in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r497436721

#### Built-in numeric conversions

Should be fine now. One concern is `decimal` here. The spec defines some explicit conversions and `decimal` is the only built-in numeric type that exposes these as `op_Explicit` methods. I implemented the conversions according to the spec in `GetBuiltInNumericConversions` (including `decimal`), and opt-out of decimal here https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496965837

#### Built-in numeric enum conversions

Added in da2260cc. Only parts of the [built-in conversions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/conversions#explicit-enumeration-conversions) are covered:
* [ ] From sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char, float, double, or decimal to any enum_type.
* [x] From any enum_type to sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char, float, double, or decimal.
* [ ] From any enum_type to any other enum_type.

✔️ Accepted. 

#### Description and glyph

I would like to change the description for conversions. Currently, the description is given for the `IMethodSymbol` of `op_Explicit`. I think it would be better to use the `ReturnType` aka the target of the conversion to build the description. The advantage would be, that we could unify built-in conversions (no `IMethodSymbol`, but a target type) and user-defined conversions.
✔️  Try to mimic the behavior of normal operators. If that is not feasible, fall back to the target type for built-in conversions.

The glyph should be `Operator` for user-defined and built-in conversions. https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496955665
✔️ 

#### Inheritance

Conversion and inheritance are not covered yet.
✔️

### Operators

General test coverage for operators is limited (e.g. no trivia tests) in comparison with conversions.

#### Sorting
Operators are now sorted https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496964177 but the sort order needs to be reviewed. Sorting is tested.

#### Description

Currently, the `IMethodSymbol` description of the operator is shown. I think this is more confusing than helpful. It also suffers from the same problem as conversions for the built-in numeric operators: `IMethodSymbol` is not available. We may present a textual description of the operator.
✔️ Accepted as is. Built-in operators are excluded.

#### Operator lifting

Implemented according to the [spec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/expressions#lifted-operators). Tests: f36861b Implementation: 0d758cd

#### Built-in operators

Not started yet. But I have a test in place that shows the operators, that can be found on the `ITypeSymbol`. See https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496959643
I'm not convinced if we should support the built-in operators.
✔️ Accepted as is. Built-in operators are excluded.

#### Numeric promotion

[Numeric promotion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/expressions#numeric-promotions) might be relevant, but I have not looked into it too much.
❓ Optional

#### Inheritance

Operators and inheritance are not covered yet.

✔️

#### Special operators

Other operators that might be useful to suggest could be (not necessarily as part of this PR)
* `await` for task-like types in an `async` method.
* `?.` in a `#nullable enable` context with expression *maybe null*
* `??` in a `#nullable enable` context with expression *maybe null*

### Indexers

Test coverage needs some improvements (e.g. trivia), but in general, I think indexers are feature complete.
✔️ 

#### Inheritance

No tests yet, but should just work.

in the `uxtw` case, the JIT emits w9, but in the `uxtb`/`uxth` cases, it incorrectly emits `x9` instead of `w9`.

"@github Thanks for your changes 👍, you are right the `return` statement was useless., I'm not sure that new changes for ternary operator have the right indentation., it seems that condition has been formatted without addition indentation. Some time ago I was working on migration the repo to the eslint and as I remember correctly, the following formatting was not acceptable for eslint/indent before we disabled it due to performance reasons. Can @github you check?, maybe I'm wrong. 

```ts
expression
? true
: false
```

Is it acceptable to do like so?

```ts
 symbols: type.getApparentProperties().filter(prop =>
     !isPrivateIdentifierPropertyDeclaration(isTransientSymbol(prop) && prop.syntheticOrigin ? prop.syntheticOrigin.valueDeclaration : prop.valueDeclaration)),

"I'm gonna go ahead and ask the dumb question: Why can't we _automatically_ derive the constraint of an inferred type binding from the constraint of the type being matched?

For example, given
```ts
type Quote<AString extends string> = `""${AString}""`;

type QuotedFirstElement<AStringTuple extends readonly string[]> =
  AStringTuple extends readonly [infer FirstElement, ...infer Rest]
    ? Quote<FirstElement> // Currently errors here, because `FirstElement` is only constrained to `unknown`
    : never;
```
why can't we say ""well, since `AStringTuple` has a constraint of `readonly string[]`, any _elements_ we infer from it should therefore have a constraint of `string`""?

Intuitively, I suspect there's a very good reason for this and that I just haven't thought it through enough, but someone's gotta spring the trap! 😁"

**What's wrong?**

When I was prototyping the NoGC support for regions, I notice that my code ran into a deadlock when running under server GC. When I observe the threads in detail, it appears the threads are blocking on different joins.

**Why does that happen?**
The majority of the code requires that the server GC threads all start together, follow the same path (with respect to joins), and therefore they should all be before the same join and all march towards the next join. 

The issue with this bug is that in a special case, a particular GC thread started earlier than the others and lead towards a different path. 

In particular, in a normal case, we expect all threads to be waiting at the beginning of the `gc_thread_function`. Except for the heap 0 thread, which blocks on the `ee_suspend_event`, all other threads should be blocking on the `gc_start_event`.

However, in the case of `minimal_gc_p == TRUE`, the work to reset the `gc_start_event` is skipped. Therefore when one thread is done with the work, it proceeds to run the next iteration right away without being blocked in the `gc_start_event`, and that is bad because the heap 0 thread will be waiting regardless, so all threads are not running in locked steps.

**The fix?**
I make sure the last thread entered the initial join reset the `gc_start_event` before letting all threads return from `garbage_collect`. This will ensure all threads get blocked on the same waiting condition, just like it was for the `minimal_gc_p == FALSE` case after `generation_to_condemn`.

Note that this fix is independent of `USE_REGIONS`, meaning it might happen in previous releases. We might want to consider backport this fix to earlier LTS.

When we are returning a large region during LOH compaction, the bit shift operator results in an integer overflow (note that `i` is 32 bits integer). With that, `basic_region_start` will be wrong, and thus accidentally reset the allocated pointer on the wrong region, leading to downstream issues.

This change fixes mergeability of tailcall tests: apart from simple
deduplication of the test class names and visibility fixes
I have modified the pointer and reference tests to stop using
Environment.Exit for exiting the test as that kills the merged
wrapper in in-proc execution; I have also fixed them to have main
within a class. In two cases (recurse_ep_void and test_virt)
I found out that I had previously put the Fact attribute on the
wrong method so I fixed that too. I renamed the two C# test
projects to better match the test of tests (widen to widen_r to
indicate it's a release test and thread-race_il_r to thread-race_r
as it's not an IL test).

Thanks

Tomas

Do you want the likely wrong value in the fallback or a value you know indicates it’s incorrect and you can choose 1f if you want in that case?
"Should this be embedded into the dll or stored in the app package ""assets"" system? Not sure of the perf here. Probably better in the dll as we do not have to touch the filesystem - but I may be wrong. @github once the dll is loded into memory on Android, is it fully loaded, or will this still read off disk? Are there any pros/cons with embedded resources vs assets?"

My apologies @github This PR shouldn't have triggered a validation build. Something is wrong with the exclusions I added in #27484. I'll play a bit more&hellip;
"This is the wrong file. Look at the one called ""post 2017"""
"1. you call root.FindToken 3 times with teh same arg.  Considre just doing it once.
2. you coudl simplify with ```token.GetAncestor<VarDecl>() ?? token.GetAncestor<...>() ?? token.GetAncestor<...>()```.
3. this logic looks wrong.  esp the log about variable declaration and foreach.  Specifically (due to lambdas) you could have these nodes contained within each other.  What you're really trying to say is ""find the closest containing ancestor of any of these types"".  However, this code is saying ""find the closest variable, then find the closest foreach"" with the presumption that the closest variable is closer than the closest foreach.

For '3' you sholud be able to make a test whre you're inside a foreach-variable inside a lambda inside var-decl.  The feature will fail in this case i believe. #Resolved"
"> Is there a way I could see a demo of the options?

Sure.

 * For an example that uses the same technique as in this PR, check [this demo site](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/a11ycasts/tree/master/examples/managing-focus-spa) (which you'll have to clone and run locally). Alternatively wait until a nightly preview 6 build shows up containing the change from this PR, probably today or tomorrow, then do `dotnet new blazorwasm` or `dotnet new blazorserver`.
 * For an example that uses the more complex technique, see [this demo site](https://ns7t5.csb.app/).

In both cases you'll need to run a screen reader such as the Windows 10 Narrator or NVDA. For evaluating them, it's not purely a comparison of the UX, as we also have to make tradeoffs about how general it is across site types, and how well we think developers will understand it and get good results from it even if they don't have a good grasp of accessibility. We need the code to be simple enough that you pretty much can't get it wrong even if you're new or confused.

One other good point about the `FocusOnNavigate` component added in this PR is that, if you do want the ""auto-focus skip-to-content link after navigation"" UX, then you can use `FocusOnNavigate` to achieve that. The main thing the developer would have to implement is the skip link itself."

"I'm not understanding the concern.  The original test runs the getter on the item to get the original time and stores it:

// Deleting shouldn't change any info state
item.Delete();
```
And then it runs the getter again and validates that it hasn't changed from what was stored:

"I do want it to be collected in the test, I am testing profiler behavior with unloadable statics. The behavior that I want is that the test loads an assembly and unloads it, then verify that GetAppDomainStaticAddress always either returns a valid object or CORPROF_E_DATAINCOMPLETE. 

The problem is that before this change the ALC wouldn't last for the whole LoadCollectibleAssembly method. It would work sometimes but if a GC happened at the wrong point the call to `dynamicLibrary.GetType` would crash the runtime because the ALC was collected and then finalized.

Having the call to unload at the end of the method forces the behavior I want, where the assembly is loaded and then unloaded."

"Thanks for the comments.  I believe I have updated as per the last comment.  I tried the Wasm Generics test in a loop 100 times and it completed without errors, so this fix looks good for CoreRT/Wasm.  I'm sure you experts will advise if I have it wrong."
"💡 Also add a test just like this one, but with the argument to the indexer being `int` instead of `Range`. The refactoring should work in this case because the indexer syntax will continue to use the `Slice` method instead of the indexer with the wrong type."
"ClickedItem contains the BindingContext not the Cell.  It's only a cell if the BindingContext is also a Cell which isn't a case where we would still want to pass it in as the cell argument. *NotifyRowTapped* needs to just locate the Cell itself where the event fires. Which is also broken on UWP but this change makes it less broken.

This scenario was fairly edge case anyway because since ClickedItem is the BindingContext it will almost never be a Cell unless it's binding to itself or the BindingContext for some reason implements Cell (which it normally won't). So in almost all cases this cast will just be null and in the cases where it's not null then it's passing the wrong Cell into *NotifyRowTapped*"
"It looks like there are a number of other places in this file that are wrong (`locate`, et al). I think a safer approach than trying to modify all the use sites is to have `file_entry_t::read` take an extra `force_extract` parameter, then pass it through to each `file_entry_t` constructor and store it in a field. Then we can check the field in `needs_extraction` and avoid changing all the call sites"

"The description for this is ""changing a reloadable type (marked by {0})"", which made me think the argument would be the attribute, not the type name. Am I reading the line wrong?"

"How strongly do you feel about this? I was trying to avoid duplicating code that exists in the Rebuild project, and will eventually become part of the compiler, but can't currently be re-used.

I don't feel like there is necessarily a downside to using the command line parser (though I know it doesn't map everything correctly), but maybe I'm wrong?"
I reapplied this change and the differences are now what we'd expect to see.  I don't know what went wrong there!
"> I don't see what's wrong with the new suggested name. Can you elaborate please?

"ah, just use `throw new InvalidatiOperationException()` here. No need for helper since it's not a hot path (when exception is being thrown in this case). Also, `string? s_defaultTempPath = null` is correct. string.Empty is wrong."
since it's pointing at the wrong path and passing those old exclusions can probably be removed.  I'll do it in a separate pr

"It's probably worth mentioning that JS is crazy and, I believe, can have both an `export=` and non-`export=` exports, via a file like

```ts

"I've filed #34826 based on your comment. It looks like a bug to me.

Unfortunately, if that fixed things it means that something is wrong with having the IsSupported check be an actual call instead of a jit intrinsic I think. That's very odd, and I want you to track why that is happening before I think its reasonable to sign off on the change."
"There's also the idea of making optional the elements whose binding elements have default initializers, even if they are present in the top level initializer:

``` ts
function g7([x = 0, y = 0] = [0, 0]) { }
g7([]);  // Should work because first and second element should be optional
g7([0]); // Should work because second element should be optional
g7([0, """"]); // Should not work because type is wrong for second element
```

@github I got the numbering scheme wrong. The next non-servicing version for .NET SDK will be 6.0.200 (we just shipped 6.0.100 and servicing will stay in the 100 range).
"Consumers of `isDefinition`:

1. [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/872e6715b4c528c563782d783913a68ca48b3a76/src/vs/editor/contrib/gotoSymbol/browser/goToSymbol.ts#L75) - if regular FAR returns exactly two results, ""compact"" results are requested, and exactly one of the results is not a definition, then the single non-definition will be returned.  (Unfortunately, this is accomplished using two separate tsserver requests.)
2. [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/languageFeatures/codeLens/referencesCodeLens.ts#L45) - CodeLens always drops `isDefinition` results from the references count.
3. VS - The old implementation ignores it.
4. VS - The new implementation appears to (incorrectly?) assume that there will be exactly one definition in the result and uses it (or, in practice, the last occurrence) to determine whether the definition is read or written.

Edit: I filed a bug suggesting VS ignore it entirely.
Edit: The command name for (1) is ""Go to References"" or  `editor.action.goToReferences`
Edit: Using `isDefinition` for (1) will produce slightly wrong behavior if both ""references"" are declarations (e.g. an exported class and an import of that class) - the editor will jump to the other declaration, rather than showing the peek window.  This doesn't seem worth fixing."
"Sadly there are still issues with the fix in this PR as well as the fix in (the now closed) #45628. The core issue looks to be mutually recursive types in which variance is flipped by one of the types. For example:

```ts
type Foo<T> = {
  x: T;
  f: FooFn<T>;
}

type FooFn<T> = (foo: Foo<T>) => void;

declare let foo1: Foo<string>;
declare let foo2: Foo<unknown>;

declare let fn1: FooFn<string>;
declare let fn2: FooFn<unknown>;

foo1 = foo2;  // Error
foo2 = foo1;  // Error

fn1 = fn2;  // Error
fn2 = fn1;  // Error
```

Above, the `x` property in `Foo<T>` witnesses `T` co-variantly and the `f` property witnesses `T` recursively and contra-variantly. The combination should cause `T` to be considered invariant, and it is in the example above. But with a small change to `FooFn<T>` things fall apart:

```ts
type FooFn<T> = (foo: Foo<T[]) => void;
```

Now, because `T` isn't referenced as a ""naked"" type parameter, we don't examine the `Foo<T[]>` reference structurally, but rather attempt to rely on the computed variance--which is in the process of being computed. So, results come out wrong and are potentially sensitive to order of computation. For example, with this PR we get the following behavior:

```ts
foo1 = foo2;  // Error
foo2 = foo1;

fn1 = fn2;
fn2 = fn1;
```

meaning co-variance for `Foo<T>` and no witnessing in `FooFn<T>`. With #45628 we get

```ts
foo1 = foo2;  // Error
foo2 = foo1;

fn1 = fn2;
fn2 = fn1;  // Error
```

i.e. contra-variance for `FooFn<T>` which is slightly more consistent, but still wrong.

The tricky aspect of this example (and others like it) is that invariance isn't revealed unless we examine multiple circular type references structurally and in-depth. Which of course is exactly what we're trying to avoid with the variance computation in the first place."

"> @github, I'm not sure who order this assemblies, but yes, if they are in a wrong order will be a problem. I thought that when blazor generates blazor.boot.json it was being ordered there. @github do you know if the assemblies are ordered before being loaded on blazor?

I think we may be sort of getting lucky because the results of the resolver step insert things in a working order into the json but the runtime doesn't actually require that, it waits for everything to transfer before attempting to load.  I wonder if we should do the same here, it might actually speed up loading because we wouldn't be loading all the other assemblies multiple times."

"Hi @github, and thanks for submitting this PR. .NET API documentation actually lives in a separate repo, [dotnet/dotnet-api-docs](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs).

"Actually this is the wrong behavior. We wrote in the spec that the server can ignore `StreamItem` and `Completion` messages after the stream has been closed.

This text is wrong. 403's aren't the result of exceptions.
"> Another thing I've realized is that if the customer creates their own class deriving from IJSObjectReference and attempts to grab an instance of it via JS interop, the new exception will not be thrown since their own type is from a different assembly. Should we handle this case as well?

That doesn't seem like a problem to me either. We don't need to recognize 3rd-party subtypes of `IJSObjectReference` since there's no way we'd know which concrete instance type to create. So I'd expect it to be treated as `JSCallResultType.Default`, as it already is here.

Good catch on `DotNetObjectReference` though! To be honest, I'm not massively bothered about providing a specific exception if people try to use `JSObjectReference` instead of `IJSObjectReference`. The equivalent would be trying to `@github JSRuntime JS` instead of `IJSRuntime`, and we don't have any exception for that except the default one from DI.

I think if someone does mistakenly use `InvokeAsync<JSObjectReference>(...)` then they'll get an exception from the JSON deserializer saying it doesn't have a default constructor, which is basically good enough because then the developer will have no choice but to realise they are doing it wrong and will have to check docs again or another working implementation to copy/paste.

So in summary I'd be fine with a simplified update like:

```cs
if ((resultType.Assembly == _currentAssembly)
  && (resultType is one of the three known IJSObjectReference ones))
{
    return JSCallResultType.JSObjectReference;
}
else
{
    return JSCallResultType.Default;
}
```

We could even choose to leave the previous implementation as-is, but adding the `resultType.Assembly == _currentAssembly` check seems at least marginally useful."

"Profilers achieve this modification using either [SetILFunctionBody](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo-setilfunctionbody-method) or [RequestReJIT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo4-requestrejit-method). The ReJIT case has its safety enforced by the runtime - each time the profiler calls RequestReJIT we allocate a new ILCodeVersion and every JIT request is bound to a particular NativeCodeVersion which in turn implies a specific ILCodeVersion. In the case of tiered compilation or OSR the NativeCodeVersion being constructed was bound to the same ILCodeVersion as the tier0 native code, regardless if the profiler has created some new IL versions in the meantime. For ReJIT GetAndVerifyILHeader() allows the IL code for a given ILCodeVersion to be provided by the profiler lazily, but it is still logically immutable. Whatever IL the profiler gives the runtime is cached in the ILCodeVersion object and that same IL is returned on every future query. We know that the tier0 code would have already requested IL so all the tier1 requests will be working off the runtime cached copy.

SetILFunction body is the older and less safe variation that currently relies on correct usage by profiler authors rather than runtime enforcement. The documentation tells them that they should not do this:

    > The SetILFunctionBody method can be called on only those functions that have never been compiled by a just-in-time (JIT) compiler.

The current implementation of SetILFunctionBody overrides the IL of the initial ILCodeVersion. The runtime code treats that IL as if it were immutable, but clearly with abuse by the profiler author it wouldn't be. If a profiler is making these types of modifications and leaving tiered compilation enabled then they have already broken the tiered compilation case (tier0 and tier1 would use different IL). I could imagine that getting it wrong in the OSR case has more visble failure modes though. I haven't thought it through all the way, but probably a safer place to be in the future is to re-implement SetILFunctionBody so that it allocates new ILCodeVersions similar to ReJIT so that we can version it explicitly.

"WIP commit message:

```markdown
Context: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/5838

Setting `$(AndroidEnablePreloadAssemblies)`=False, which disables
assembly preloading (see af02a65a), could result in a crash when:

 1. The launched `Activity` isn't located within the ""main App
    assembly"", the assembly built as part of the `App.apk` build, and

 2. The launched `Activity` uses Android Resource IDs, and

 3. Those Android Resource IDs differ between the Library project
    build and the Application project build (usually the case).

This setup is exemplified by the
`DebuggingTest.ClassLibraryMainLauncherRuns()` unit test.

Our current Resource architecture assumes/ensures that there is
Only One™ `Resource` type mentioned by an assembly-level
`ResourceDesignerAttribute` custom attribute, with
`ResourceDesignerAttribute.IsApplication`=true:

	[assembly: global::Android.Runtime.ResourceDesignerAttribute(""My.Resource"", IsApplication=true)]

The `ResourceIdManager.UpdateIdValues()` method looks for this
attribute in all loaded assemblies, and when (if) found, will
invoke the `UpdateIdValues()` static method on the specified type.

The problem is that only the *App assembly* `Resource.UpdateIdValues()`
method does anything, and if the App assembly isn't loaded -- which
may be the case when the `Activity` loaded isn't from the App assembly
and assembly preload is disabled -- then:

 1. `ResourceIdManager.UpdateIdValues()` never finds the
    `ResourceDesignerAttribute`, and

 2. `Resource.UpdateIdValues()` is never invoked, and

 3. Android Resource IDs in non-App assemblies are never updated to
    contain their correct values.

Thus, attempting to use an Android resource may result in unexpected
failures:

	var button = FindViewById<Button> (Resource.Id.myButton);
	// `button` is null, because `Resource.Id.myButton` has the wrong value.

This can result in `NullReferenceException`s:

	android.runtime.JavaProxyThrowable: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
	    at MyLibrary.MainActivity.OnCreate(Bundle bundle)
	    at Android.App.Activity.n_OnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_(IntPtr jnienv, IntPtr native__this, IntPtr native_savedInstanceState)
	    at com.xamarin.classlibrarymainlauncherruns.MainActivity.n_onCreate(Native Method)
	    at com.xamarin.classlibrarymainlauncherruns.MainActivity.onCreate(MainActivity.java:29)

Fix this by *always* loading the App assembly during process startup,
which also happens to be the *first* assembly listed within the
generated `mono.MonoPackageManager_Resources.Assemblies` array, which
is provided to `Runtime.initInternal()`.

You are working on a huge stuff nowadays (RPC, buffer rewrite, settings UI, state  storage, and so much more) and I really don't want to delay you, but I feel somewhat frustrated lately and want to share it.

* Large contribution split into many - is endless :smile:

Don't get me wrong - I know that you are putting a lot of effort in reviewing my commits and in majority of cases your feedback is very timely. I totally value that! And yet, even few PRs that are stuck / having no assignee / reviewer spoil the impression as it feels as irrational use of time.

I still continue contributing, as I really believe in you and the product I use every day, but this frustration persists and I haven't found a cure myself yet :blush:

I absolutely understand the challenge you are facing as a small team under MSFT's quality requirements and I am not coming with a specific suggestion of how and whether to solve this, but just wanted to raise a flag that if a contributor needs to wait a week for a follow up / several weeks to close all required cycles, this can make an  establishment of robust community challenging.

Another **disclaimer**: This above is probably my personal issue and other contributors don't feel so.

In addition, I know I asked this is in the past, but if there are specific areas that can make my contributions more impactful (increasing the ROI of more frequent reviews) please let me know. I tried to solve P1s or tickets with many up-votes - but empirically it hardly increases the odds :blush:

Sorry if it was emotional - simply we are reaching another week-end where I don't know how to advance..

Something feels wrong about this set of type parameters. If we say that this type should have type parameters on its own, then this what we should implement. Another way to somehow express that is to set ```ContainingSymbol``` to be the first generic container that contains the code that creates the type. This feels strange too, because we will be introducing a concept of a type contained within a method. Also, these type parameters feel important, yet they do not participate in equality.

"> I prefer CreateA and CreateB because they give an indication on when each should be used (I'm the same way on overloads generally, I prefer to have different names indicating when to use each if they are really for different purposes)

My main concern here is following existing patterns in the code base (personal pref is CreateA, CreateB methods).  I tried searching through the code base for guidance and unfortunately there isn't a lot to be had.  
- Types which have CreateA / CreateB factory model: 1
- Types which have Create only: 0

There are more examples for `internal` types but for `public` types there is very little data (or my program to look for it had a bug).

I'm not opposed to this, but I think using `Serialized` is the wrong terminology.  It's implying a very specific use which we are currently removing from the compiler.

"Good catch on getEffectiveTypeAnnotationNode!

Unfortunately, I tried your proposed change and `node` ends up 1-too-high after the loop -- that is, it's the node above the ParameterDeclaration in the tests below, so `node.parent.type` ends up looking for the type two nodes above the ParameterDeclaration. Also I still had to use `Node` as the type for binding.parent, since `node.parent.parent` is a big union type that isn't assignable to BindingPattern. The elaboration points out that CallSignatureDeclaration, at least, is wrong.

I did work around the 2-too-high problem by tracking the previous parent on each iteration:

```ts
            let node: Node = binding.parent;
            let decl = binding.parent.parent;

I think both the assertion created is wrong and it also seems wrong that we allow the replacement of a ubyte typed `LCL_VAR` with a non zero-extended value.

Yeah that is weird. Even if it were to match ICloneable interface annotation would be wrong as it defines the return value as `object` not `object?`. Will open an issue in arcade.
"@github

That matches my memories of this. I tracked down the point where we moved to this package and it's PR #29827. 

@github may remember why we needed the non-RTM packages here. My vague memory is that this is still the time when we were dealing with the issues around MS.VB.dll being incomplete. It took a while to find all the places where the incomplete version was being published and fix it to have the complete one. This is likely another one of those cases

"> This is effectively a test issue and not a product issue
> the test server is supposed to be doing the wrong thing and the runtime should be able to handle it.

These sound contradictory? : ) If the runtime can't handle something that it should be able to handle, that is the definition of a product issue.

I think the discussion is making one of a few assumptions. I want to make it explicit which one and make sure everyone agrees with the choice:
a) [Test issue] It was never intended for the runtime to work with a tool that does what the test did (prior to this change)
b) [Product Issue] It was intended to make the runtime work with a tool that does what the test did, however the value in doing so is not enough to justify the dev time, risk, or whatever else involved in resolving it
c) [Product issue] It was intended to make the runtime work with a tool that does what the test did, but it is impossible to implement this behavior on MacOS
d) something else?

A few other misc thoughts:
1. None of the examples I see online suggest that a well-written unix domain socket server would need to delete the socket file prior to closing the socket. If customers write their own servers they probably aren't going to do it unless we doc it and they are diligently reading our docs (a dubious assumption).
2. A tool that repeatedly creates and destroys the socket in a loop probably isn't something a customer would write. However a tool that calls unlink(), socket(), bind(), listen(), accept() in that order and then crashes and restarts at the beginning of the sequence seems pretty reasonable. In theory doing that in a loop with close() at the end simulates what would happen if that server crashed a lot, or if it crashed at just the right moment in time to cause us trouble. I assume we don't know definitively if crashing and relaunching does reproduce the same problem that we see with looping?
3. The description of the issue certainly seemed surprising. If I understand correctly you are saying that poll() returns HUP after the server socket is closed, but calling connect() immediately afterwards is able to reconnect to the closed socket, this generates no error and future calls to poll() do not return HUP?

"I'm not sure I understand how #42485 helps. Before the fix in this PR we'd end up hitting the panic limit at 100 recursive invocations and output an `Excessive stack depth comparing types...` diagnostic, which prints the two types. This happed relatively quickly, but it is nonetheless wrong behavior.

With the PR we keep successfully relating types until we get to 50 levels of instantiations and then stop--but without printing any types, so #42485 wouldn't affect anything. It takes longer for this to occur but that isn't surprising given the very large number of types `XMLHpptRequest` touches if you recursively iterate over all of its properties."
"Another possible conclusion:

We need more analysis of the new errors to figure out how the codefix causes the new errors. I thought that adding `undefined` wouldn't change anything since that used to be the semantics, but it sounds like I was wrong.

In the meantime, we need to decide between shipping a half-baked codefix or not. We've done this before! But for a new pedantic feature, I don't think we'll do much better than codemods written by the experts who adopt new features. So I'm leaning toward not shipping it.

@github do you have an opinion about this?"
"As mentioned - I'm very open to revisiting XState types to see if we can improve the situation anyhow there. I know that this is just a single library whereas this PR potentially impacts a lot more than that though. However, as a dev, I would always take a slower compilation over random errors - so this PR is a big improvement from my point of view.

Is there any rough description for the overall algorithm of how the variance is computed? If I understand correctly then:
- each type parameter has its own variance type
- to compute it we may need to traverse the whole type structurally, because if `T` is passed down through multiple layers then any layer can impact the variance type of the associated type parameter at the root level (and on each level in between)
- potentially when assessing that a type param is invariant you can return early from the algorithm since nothing else can change that
- this information can mostly be cached per uninstantiated type unless conditional types/mapped types do some weird-ish transformations under the hood (not saying that you are caching it, but that such a heuristic could potentially be used, I have no idea if it would be worth it - this is just me trying to understand the problem space better)

I wonder if there is any type construct that makes it impossible for you to take the associated ""slot"" into consideration? Like - I see how ""makes"" type params are taken into consideration, even when a type is ""boxed"" using some other type I can see how the relation gets transitive etc But when I think about crazy conditional & mapped types... I'm getting lost.

In somewhat other words - I wonder if there is anything that we possibly could do to make TS not descend into a particular branch of the structure?"
" geoffkizer : I went back and checked the docs one more time. The documentation for Dns.GetHostName says it ""A string that contains the DNS host name of the local computer."" and ComputerNameDnsDomain says ""The name of the DNS domain assigned to the local computer."" I don't have a cluster to test it on but the documentation for gethostname() says it returns the cluster name. So if `gethostname()` is returning something else, the code is already wrong."
"> I'm just going to close this. Was opportunistically improving something that jumped out at me while reviewing the code for another reason, but it's resulting in diving head first into the world of we don't really like how all of this header parsing is structured in general and not wanting to make these kinds of changes until the whole thing is just overhauled, whenever that may be.

If the PR was just about spanification then I don't think we'd be diving, head-first or otherwise. 

Where we started diving into trouble, I think, was the changes re HttpRuleParser.GetNumberLength. This change isn't just an obvious improvement; it changes the behavior of the method in certain cases, which is naturally going to induce various questions about whether and how to make those changes.

The conversation also got unnecessarily complicated because I read your code wrong initially and was confused; sorry for that, I should have read the code more closely."

- Use F_SETLK64 for fcntl to fix an issue where 32bit arm Android apps would get the wrong flag
- Add numerical magic numbers for missing file systems to Interop.UnixFileSystemTypes so they are correctly recognized
- Make ping test a bit more forgiving if the process returns a few milliseconds _before_ the timeout
- Disable System.IO.Net5Compat.Tests.csproj on Helix for non-Windows platforms like intended, we were still building it since we pass `/p:ArchiveTests=true` on CI

"Note for reviewers: GitHub diff view seems to suggest the indentation for this is ""wrong"" but the actual changes look correct when not looking at the diff view."
"> Actually, forget my idea above; [I implemented it](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/68234), but method overload resolution means it _likely_ will call the wrong overload. Examples in the PR.

Thanks for trying that out, @github. The idea was intriguing."
This condition seems wrong. Wouldn't this project fail to build using `dotnet build` even if native assets are already built?
"I picked ulong because it was easier to make robust:

* Ints don’t implicitly convert to or from it (unlike long), so you get compile time checking that we’re consistent everywhere in .NET
* The JS-side code for reading uint64 is simpler and harder to get wrong than if it was reading int64, as there’s no sign bit to account for."
"Just realised this is now wrong since we’re no longer using XMLHttpRequest.

Is the `EXISTS` check using a cache of the directory content from earlier in the build❔ If yes, what's the workaround (I prefer to avoid separating those test projects into another build step)❔ If no, what am I doing wrong❔"
This was way wrong before and we likely don't really need `node` in `$env:Path` on Windows

"Should I remove the same check from https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/39358?

"Is this class really needed? What would go wrong if we set the `GZipSteam` directly to `Request.Body`?
```
var decompressionStream = decompressionProvider.CreateStream(originalBody);
context.Request.Body = decompressionStream;
```

In case there are something that should be done in a new stream, could it at least use inheritance instead of compositions for the known encodings? The providers returns the custom type which implement a marker interface `IDontNeedWrapper` (Very good name, I know!! 😅) and the middleware only wrap the stream if it needs a wrapper.

```
internal sealed class GZipRequestDecompressionBody : GZipStream, IDontNeedWrapper {}
internal sealed class DeflateRequestDecompressionBody : DeflateStream , IDontNeedWrapper {}
internal sealed class BrotliRequestDecompressionBody : BrotliStream, IDontNeedWrapper {}

In this case we save one allocation per request for the known encodings."

"Or is the assumption here that somebody in different legal contexts (contractor who uses multiple machines) needs different options? Not saying this is wrong, just want to make sure this was intentional vs. something that fell out by copypasta."
"Yep, if you want to take a quick look at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/27534/commits/5de1fad0d7ecba7d88617356954cb96ccae2b1d4 and make sure there isn't anything super wrong with it from a build perspective, that would be nice :)"
My assumption about the precedence of ExcludeAssets being transitive was wrong.  Since the dependencies of SSP are transitive it lets the non-excluded references win over those marked with exclude.  To workaround we need to add all of them.
"> Is sending back HTTP/1.1 on a HTTP/2 connection be legal? Sure, the client is wrong, but do two wrongs make a right?

But it's not an HTTP/2 connection, is it? This check says the client is trying to do HTTP/1.x. The server hoped for HTTP/2 but didn't get it. The goal is to respond in a way the client will understand."
"@github something looks wrong here. Both of our main Linux builds produce files named e.g. aspnetcore-targeting-pack-7.0.0-preview.3.22151.16.rpm but we use platform-specific names for the Windows targeting packs. What is the intention here -- aspnetcore-targeting-pack-7.0.0-preview.3.22151.16.rpm or aspnetcore-targeting-pack-7.0.0-preview.3.22151.16-arm64.rpm❔

We'll need to make a change either way -- stop uploading the extra targeting packs (and remove duplicates from the asset manifests) or change the names."
The `else` here looks wrong. `hasErrors` should always be set to `true`. The `if (disposeMethod is null)` should be enough to ensure we're in an error case.
`Empty` has the wrong comparer. The API allows for `null` and uses a cached singleton.
Please remove this spec reference to `InvalidOperationException` for wrong branch kinds. We should return null in that case.
"❕ This is a collection initializer, not an object initializer (test is correct, but the method name here is wrong)"
"A NuGet package can come with a variety of assets inside it. For this line there are two types that are important: runtime and compile time. The compile time assets are the libraries that we compile against (ref dlls for example). The runtime assets are items the NuPkg believes are necessary at runtime.

For MSBuild we are hosted inside their process. We never start up MSBuild on our own and create say a workspace. This bulid task is always loaded in their runtime. Hence their runtime assets aren't useful to us (and can possibly confuse our analysis). Hence we exclude them. 

Note: this is how we handle MSBuild assets in other parts of the Roslyn repository. The build task was always ""wrong-ish"" here. "
"Consider adding the following:

```
#else
#error unsupported configuration
#endif
```

This helps guard against future changes to the target frameworks that roslyn uses. Consider that in the near future netcoreapp3.0 will be a valid target framework. With this proposed change we would get a compiler error if we forgot to update this file. Without the test would just silently stop running. 

I've been trying to take this approach in all places where we have `#if` as I've gotten this wrong several times."
"👍   Hopefully, all the construction/shuffling of the raw information is clear here for you :)   I try to keep a mental model of all the nodes and what's going on with them, which helps make certain things stand out as looking ""wrong"".  i.e. we had the 'arrow' nodes appearing in two places.  on the 'arrow' local itself, but also as leading skipped syntax for the exclamation.  This violated the strict invariants of the tree.

Thanks!"
"I'm not crazy about the `compMayUseIsa` - again, it fails to communicate that it conveys a contract, i.e. that when it returns false the code must execute correctly even on a target where it would have returned true.

@github - in your discussion above you say:
> `compUsesIsa` should not be used for this case...

I presume you mean `compUsesOrDoesNotUseIsa`.

The issue I have with `compUsesOrDoesNotUseIsa` is that it seems to be asking if we're using the isa or not - as opposed to stating a contract as part of the query. What we really want it to say is `tellMeIfICanUseThisIsaAndIfNotDisableIt` and `tellMeIfICanUseThisIsaButIfNotAllowIt` but of course that's just a bit verbose ;-)

> Could we just have enum compSupports(Isa) and have it return Unsupported, Supported, or SupportedWithCheck?

I don't think that addresses the requirements that @github has expressed - i.e. that the JIT needs to communicate which kind of support it wants, as different codegen scenarios require different answers."
"As written though it unconditionally reports the writes even though we conditionally do the bin place. That seems wrong. "
"The same exception still happens if you get something wrong, it's just if you get multiple things wrong you may not get the same error you used to. I think it's probably below the threshold of what we need to document, i.e. no, but I'm open to other opinions... @github, what do you think?"
"> Have all APIs been appropriately annotated?

I believe so.  The ctor was wrong because adding the message fallback was last minute, after remembering how frustrating it is when exceptions don't do the ""allow null in a more complex overload to represent the default from a simpler overload"" thing for messages."
">// (12,53): error CS0546: 'Derived2.P.set': cannot override because 'Derived.P' does not have an overridable set accessor [](start = 16, length = 121)

"This seems... wrong.  I see that we ""try"" to flush today from the finalizer, but we also don't block waiting for that flush to complete, and the thing we're wrapping could have already been disposed of."
">CallerArgumentExpressionParameterIndex [](http://example.com/codeflow?start=38&length=38)

This looks fragile and probably incorrect, at least for delegate EndInvoke method. This implementation assumes that the target parameter is still going to be present and will remain at the same position, which probably can be wrong. The more robust approach is to reinterpret the attribute in the new signature. But before we do this, let's create some tests and figure out if this code path is even reachable in interesting scenarios. Perhaps simply returningh -1 is going to be good enough. #Closed"

"The reverse of `DangerousRetain` is not `Dispose`, it's `DangerousRelease`.

This change effectively leaks all native NSData objects.

"This is a lot of boiler plate (88 lines in all, over 4 files) for type safety, and I see a potential problem:

- Since EventFoundEventArgs derives from EventNotFoundEventArgs, you could pretty easily fire the event with the wrong Args type and the type system won't complain.

Since there aren't any consumers (test or code), I'm not sure how much overkill this is vs a Found and NotFound event with a type string/enum."
"You are right, I was tempted by wrong change in test. "
"Actually it looks like all your indentation in this file is spaces, and not tabs (wrong editor configuration maybe?)

"Actually, this is certainly wrong.  because it means that if the edit to the tree is such that the synthesized `!!` gets moved somewhere else (e.g. to now be a suffix suppression operator), that code will break because it won't see this as two exclamation tokens, but a single token as well.  These merged tokens can't be returned from the incremental lexer as they do not correspond to what the lexer would have produced originally."
@github Is it wrong? Could you please review it? Thank you.
We should add `InferenceFlags.None` so that this ternary can be made typesafe (as-is it'd be possible to pass the wrong kind of enum to `createInferenceContext`)
"Right -- I meant to turn this into a question.

Currently, for delay sign, signing without a key is a _warning_. That seems crazy. I would like to make this an error for public sign. I'm not sure how this could possibly be a warning for public sign, but I wanted to confirm that no one has any objection.

"Given that the value for ESNext has _already_ been volatile, I see no reason not to make this one last churn and then have all these values be _not_ volatile. But I would wait for another reviewer just in case I’m not thinking of some crazy edge case.

"I _really_ dislike this regression in the API design of the internal representation of predicates. I would much rather we just added a `modifiers` or `isAssert` field to the existing two kinds (it seems like we're always looking for some pair of two of these kinds as-is!), if the new kinds of predicates going to be treated so similarly. I very much dislike the ""always `undefined`"" on some variant properties and constructor reuse - if for perf reasons, unifying the shapes is a good idea, then i'd be OK with using a constant shape in the constructor functions, but I'd like to hide it from the typesystem behind a cast, such that predicates of the wrong kind do not have the wrong members when looking at completions or exhaustiveness. Plus, it's worth remembering that ""`undefined` or a type"" is a different shape than ""always a type"", so in certain cases, the jitter _may_ perform worse on this pattern, since the shape's members have polymorphic types (which is why I hope the change was made backed up by data).

I _really_ don't wanna go over similar stuff again, but this is very similar to [a discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/5906#discussion_r46604183) we had back in 2015 when I first added `this` predicates, and I _still_ think the extra explicitness from _distinct_ constructors and distinct type shapes is worthwhile in preventing bugs in our own code (as written, this function doesn't prevent you from passing a `parameterName` to a `ThisPredicate`), _especially_ as the space of possible configurations grows. None of these predicates have similar handling in anything other than storage (despite sharing syntax), as evidenced by the liberal sprinkling of ternaries _within_ calls throughout the handling code now."
"~~That's the internal factory.~~ Sorry, wrong place. This is indeed a public factory. I'll remove this change.

"> and maybe some SIMD base types

Its most SIMD base types in practice. The SIMD base type should always be the exact type required for the underlying instruction. That includes correctly tracking the sign and size. This is important because there are many SIMD instructions that differ based on size/type and will do the wrong thing otherwise.

It was definitely a bug that the `gtType` wasn't the right thing, however."
"Isn't this just monkey-patching around the actual issue? According to the type definition this property should not be falsy, and `strictNullChecks` are enabled. That means something else is going wrong before already, and this check is just hiding the actual bug."
"That's not a bad idea, but I think if I do that, it'll end up not providing any info as to what part of the access went wrong, versus currently, it's asserting.

I'm not sure if it's a pattern to just try/catch/return undefined in this codebase, though, as that would be sort of the best of both worlds."
"Given the fact that:
- the this is the expected behavior of the traversal and CodeGen
- I haven't found an assembly instruction that could lead us to wrong debug info during just that line.

My proposal is to extend the VariableLiveRange in the case when a variable is being born in the same location it was dying the assembly instruction before."

"First, adding new public members must be discussed before done. See [api-review-process](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/api-review-process.md).

Then, it seems that you have very wrong sense about how dotnet works:

> 1. Inefficient; tries to convert the arguments to another datatype and go through their constructors which also will cause longer computation times and

That happens at **compile** time, not **run** time. Once compiled, the number is stored as is, which constructor to be used has been determined, and the constructor is just copying bytes.

However, parsing from string happens at runtime. It will never be efficient.

> You already have all of the code for the `Parse()` method so why not just use it? Just copy + paste, anyone can do this!

The attributes of `Parse` is far different from constructors:
- Constructors guarantee success. Parse may fail because the string is not a valid number.
- Constructors are **fast** because they have a pre-determined size, and just copy bytes. **Parse is slow**.
- Constructing from primitive numbers are deterministic. Converting from string can be affected by number styles."
"> could you please clarify for me why RBM_NON_BYTE_REGS does not include ESP, EBP? It has only one use but could it be wrong

I believe it's because we don't use `ESP` in the register allocator, and perhaps because `EBP` is sometimes restricted. IMO we should probably just eliminate `RBM_NON_BYTE_REGS` but I don't think it's critical."
"Merging this old PR that I keep forgetting about. The change is effectively just cleaning up some wrong logic that was never hit in the first place.

"Whell, the reason why I cared about being a possible keyword so much is because according to the comment, the parser treats single identifier as a incomplete member rather than an expression with identifier name syntax only because of keyword completion:

I tried to remove this branch of switch entirely and it didn't break any completions at all, so I guess, this is the right thing to do here. However, it introduced more than 10 failing tests, most of them are just wrong code exchanging 1 set of errors to another, but there were several I consider important, like the skipping mechanics, where parser treats trees `foo using goo` and `bar using goo` identical. I don't feel like I am able to solve this conflicts, so closing this PR. @github If you are interested in taking this one, I fully support reopening it. I didn't need to get into the enormously complicated parsing logic in the first place..."

>   - This is a moderate :-1: - we think we'd be encouraging people to use the wrong tools to solve these problems

I am curious about what the right tool is then? There doesn't really seem to be a great alternative to doing this. In particular, the problem is that of run-time equivalence; the library is intended to be usable both with plain JS and TS. JSX cannot be used without compiling, and furthermore the use-case of safe HTML templates was among the original design considerations that TC39 looked at [when adding this feature to the spec](https://web.archive.org/web/20120124053946/http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:quasis). Tagged template literals are a very natural API for native JS libraries (see also: [graphql-tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-tag), [html tag](https://github.com/zspecza/common-tags#html)).

The approach taken by Svelte/Vue (custom language servers) or tsserver plugins doesn't really scale; writing transformers to turn syntax into JSX seems like a significant amount of work, especially for smaller projects. This approach also doesn't even allow for correctness checks at compile-time."

If you can guarantee that I can have the dotnet runtime built on my Windows box in 30 minutes, I definitely want to try to prove you wrong (or admit my defeat)."
"I feel this is move wrong direction. This starts new process and add dependency on finding the right executable. I think that was OK for the test where we control the environment and overhead does not matter.  Further more, it can report group the process actually does not have.

"I agree that the ownsHandle logic looks wrong, at least based on convention where an ownsHandle=true usually means 'this new object owns the underlying handle'."
"This might be the problem.

Installer specifies `OuputRid` only, which makes the `PackageRid` value wrong (which is derived from `RuntimeOS`):

Libraries only specifies `RuntimeOS` which makes `PackageRid` correct but `OuputRid` wrong (due to `PortableBuild` defaulting to true, whatever that means)

I'm not sure we want to make this a private API because that feels wrong in the spirit of OSS, however maybe we can add some safeguards.  We could do something like make an internal `IHighlightLayer` property which supercedes the publicly visible one to make sure there's no collisions...

A couple questions:
 - Should the color of the highlight be customizable?

It appears that this test was added to test changes made in ```internal static bool IsUnsafe(this TypeSymbol type)``` function. While behavior for this particular test scenario is expected and the test is good to have, I suspect we would get the same error for an array of function pointers. I think this is unexpected, as it is unexpected for an array of regular pointers too. I assume this is due to the fact that the ```GetAnonymousTypeFieldType``` misuses the ```IsUnsafe```. I think the intent was to check for types that cannot be used as type arguments because anonymous types are generic, but it is valid to use an array of pointers as a type argument. I am going to open an issue about that. Once/if that is fixed, it is very likely ```GetAnonymousTypeFieldType``` would stop using ```IsUnsafe``` and this test would stop covering its modification. At the same time it appears that this is the only tests added to cover that. So, I am suggesting to find another scenario to cover changes in ```IsUnsafe```, a scenario that has nothing to do with anonymous types.

You are looking in the wrong type.  According to the spec we are to look in the type of the return of the `Clone` method. #Resolved"
Please add a test like this (`X`) but in which the type of the property in `A` and in `C` are incompatible. There should be an error that the override has the wrong type.
"> Adding the methodimpl entries changes what overridden method the runtime binds the override to. Since we want to remain compatible with previous behavior (right or wrong) for buggy runtimes, we do not want to change what we produce.

> See TestAmbiguousOverridesRefOut in CodeGenOverridingAndHiding as changed in iteration 33. Depending on the order of the declarations, the override would change from being correct to incorrect or vice versa (both tested).

I am just trying to understand why the code is written this way here. Could you, please, help me out with that?

At first, the logic feels wrong because we might not emit a MethodImpl for true covariant return case with ambiguous runtime override. However, one might argue that in the case when the runtime doesn't support covariant returns, we would report an error elsewhere and wouldn't even try to emit. Does this match the line of thinking you use? If so, consider capturing this in a comment.

On the other hand, could this negatively affect retargeting scenario when covariant returns involved? It looks like we would fail to communicate the presence of the covariant return override to the KnownOverriddenClassMethod above, potentially negatively affecting resolution of what the method overrides in that new universe. Is this possible? It might be worth adding some tests around this scenario. We might want to use a slightly different logic in this helper specifically for the purpose of RetargetingMethodSymbol.ExplicitlyOverriddenClassMethod.

I'm not saying this one is bad or wrong, but an alternate vision I have is that you would register an object with the TextBuffer that contained a pattern, region of interest, and a callback method/event inside of it. The TextBuffer would just... of its own accord as things are written in on the other methods (and maybe with its own internal, private thread or threadpool worker) grind through the region with the pattern and make callbacks as necessary.

Almost like you have an `ITextScanner` interface with an `ITextMatchFound` callback interface... which might lend itself toward easy adaptation into a COM/WinRT-based plug-in model for arbitrary buffer scanners in the future.

"That's somewhat concerning.  Couldn't this cause us to hold onto something like an IEnumerable and then evaluate it on the wrong threaD?  I recall issues like that in the past.   This is esp. concerning as the caller will certainly see the constructor and think that all the values are treated in the same way.  

The way we dealt with this was to make it explicit that things were lazy by taking in `Func<Whatever> createDocumentation`.  That way the caller understaood this would be called in the future.

We use that pattern, for example, in completion lists.  I think that would be far preferred here.

"Something must be going wrong with CI on the `Install Certificates` step:
```

"Thanks for pointing this out. 

To be honest I am not sure how to deal with it as a correct implementation of `Length` should return the same value before and after calling `Flush`, similar to our [implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/a991e1349e4325770d8e2ddf085184a68cd2555b/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/Strategies/BufferedFileStreamStrategy.cs#L55-L71)

```cs
long before = fileStream.Length;
fileStream.Flush();
long after = fileStream.Length;
Assert.Equal(before, after);
```

I can:

1. keep the code as it is (invalid `FileStream` implementation can in theory run into trouble)
2. move the length fetching and validation after call to `Flush` (it could change the exception thrown for empty files for cases where uses has also provided wrong `access` and `inheritability` which should be very rare).
3. re-fetch the `Length` after the call to `Flush` for custom types derived from `FileStream`

My preferences: 1 > 2 > 3

"> Overall, I'm not saying that doing a binding check is wrong. I'm saying it's not necessary or even recommended per the guidelines we'd settled on.

I want to call this out. 

A binding check is very necessary here and it is recommended.  I realize we've been lax here and we could have done a better job being explicit in the rules. I'll take the blame there in not disseminating this information clearly enough. 

Note: I tried to convey this in some of the compiler talks I did on this topic and many of the cleanup PRs I've sent through to get the parser into a healthier state here. However, as per an above comment, I would often speak in generalities without being as explicit as possible about what this should apply to. I will stop doing this from now on and will be much more precise. 

The guidelines strongly indicate the purpose is to fit the syntactic model and that we should be context free.  Using parse options to dictate diagnostics violates both of those guidelines. As per an above comment, the guidelines were also not created out of thin air. They were provided based highly in the needs of the ide.  

The ide is the primary consumer of incremental parsing. The ide is the primary component that makes validity checks based on syntactic diagnostics. And the ide is the component that has to deal with the perf fallout of options changing. 

The guidelines here were driven by our design goals on how the syntactic subsystem should be as impervious as possible to ephemera like this. 

That's why the pr intentionally does things the right way wrt diagnostics, and it's something we should fix the rest of the parser to do. I've made changes here in the past asking those lines, but I haven't been able to focus my attention on stamping this out completely.

"I added some more statement kinds in the walk up for the 0-length span request, using `isValidExpressionOrStatement` with types
```ts
    type ValidExpressionOrStatement = ValidExpression | ValidStatement;
    type ValidExpression = BinaryExpression | ConditionalExpression;
    type ValidStatement = ExpressionStatement | ReturnStatement | VariableStatement;
```
We then will grab a valid expression from the statement if we did not already stop at an expression. 

There may be a more general way to do this by instead stopping at an `invalid` node, but I get the impression that there are more kinds of things that can be found inside of statements than there are statements that users would be likely to select. There's also a good chance that I'm wrong :)"

Changed a bunch of dprintf levels, eg from 3 to 1 when they are for FATAL_GC_ERROR 'cause you'd always want them; from 1 to 2 in seg_mapping table functions 'cause there could be tons of these when there are many heaps.

Fixed a perf bug in commit_new_mark_array introduced by the refactor change (#1688). This doesn't cause functional problems - we are just calling the same commit_mark_array_with_check on new_heap_segment multiple times.

Got rid of keep_card_live - all it needs is just to increase the cross gen pointer count.

Got rid of useful empty lines/comments/a few vars.

Renamed a few vars to the actual meaning.

Renamed should_commit_mark_array to is_bgc_in_progress and modified a few places to call it instead of duplicated code.

Moved the decision of condemning 1 when bgc is in progress to joined_generation_to_condemn (should logically belong there anyway) which fixes the problem that GCToEEInterface::DiagGCStart was getting the wrong condemned gen in this case.

Make PARALLEL_MARK_LIST_SORT always defined and got rid of code when it's not.

Proper checks for FEATURE_LOH_COMPACTION in a few places.

Changed some really long lines (please try to keep lines under 110 chars in general).

"I know this is existing code, but it looks wrong, and if so this is a serious bug.

This feels wrong. Overall this seems to be a pervasive pattern in our options code now: having APIs that accept public types but then asserting / throwing if it's not a specific derived type. Makes me question if we have the appropriate design here.
"@github you proposed to do:

>In fact, to make your life easier. Just call: CommonCompletionUtilities.GetWordSpan. However, for the isWordCharacter helper pass: ch => SyntaxFacts.IsIdentifierPartCharacter(ch) || ch == '.'

`CommonCompletionUtilities.GetWordSpan` moves the end further only if the char before the cursor is a word character. Therefore I decided to make a copy of the relevant code. I do also think that we should not rely on `IsIdentifierPartCharacter` here, because we expect an assembly name with an optional `, PublicKey=hash` appendix. So a proper character list would be 
* all chars allowed in an assembly name
* comma, space, and equals sign

Note: I currently use `IsWhiteSpace` which is also wrong because a space is allowed within an assembly name: 
`, <space> PublicKey=`."

"When binding during return type inference, there is nothing wrong with having some returned expressions unbound.  Binding them to any particular type would cause us to infer an incorrect result type.  Even in error recovery scenarios.

"Well, the replacement is just a dumb *in all the code, replace a character* command with no further context information.

I thought of maybe another *fix*. Apart from the one informational issue that tab characters get replaced by space characters I'd say the major problem are the visual issues:

1. Tabs are being fixed to a size of 4.
2. Mid-text tabs do not have the expected aligning effect.

As long as the resulting length is 4 I personally do not care about 1. to be honest. I use them to align mid-text, though.

```txt
apple	red
banana	yellow
lime	green
```

So I am thinking about a fix for 2. I could replace the few calls to `String#replace()` by a custom function that does the current replacements and replaces tabs by either 2, 3 or 4 spaces depending on their offset within the line to mimic their aligning nature. This should have no impact on indentation tabs, but fix mid-text tabs.

```txt
apple   red
banana  yellow
lime    green
```

Currently, this would be the result:
```txt
apple    red
banana    yellow
lime    green

Why is this important for me? I haven't posted anything about it, yet, and I don't know how open you are for introducing new settings to VS Code, but I was thinking about a new setting allowing users to decide whether they want their quick infos with `white-space: pre-wrap` and a monospace font (configurable globally or for the workspace and for each file type as well). I [asked on SO in the past whether I could enable preserving whitespace](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61024647/how-to-alter-documentation-comment-parsing-or-at-least-disable-markdown-there-in) and I think there is no way currently.

"@github Indicators originally belonged to CarouselView. It was part of the CarouselView code. Then we decided to break the dependency on CarouselView because IndicatorView could be used for any control that the user wanted to create. 

This flexibility came at a cost for people who wanted an easy way to show indicators for a CarouselView, so we invented this way to easily bind the two together. We don't need to easily bind the IndicatorView to a custom control because at that point, the user is already opting for a more advanced scenario.

If we put a strong link on the IndicatorView, it suggests that the IndicatorView is only for the CarouselView, which is false. If we try to make it generic, now the IndicatorView is trying to unbox something to see if it has a known path for binding to it, which is inefficient and is the wrong place for that responsibility. And to have users override that to provide their own link is more code than just writing the bindings, as you pointed out.

I like this convenience property for the CarouselView, but I'd rather remove it than put it back on IndicatorView, personally.

Thoughts?"

"As far as I remember, the rationale for `EntryCount` being `long` was some sort of compatibility with BCL's `ZipArchive` (which doesn't have `EntryCount` but has a collection which has a signed integer `Count` property). At the same time, I always avoid using signed integers whenever a size or an index is concerned - on the notion that we have no negative indices and we have no negative sizes (or at least - they make no sense). Thus using an unsigned integer limits the size of the error domain (index can be too big, but can't be too small - one less thing that can go wrong)"

"My sample was just trying to figure out how things are working and shouldn’t be considered how I want things to work. I wrote the operations in that order because that’s how they worked at the time.

In column-vector transformers, it is expected that the right-most operation happens first.

You can see this with CGContext’s and their transformers. They’re column transformers and therefore the first operation has to come last.

 If you pickup any OpenGL book you’ll see the transformation pipeline written as:

    P*V*M*v = projectedPoint

The vector is first transformed by the Model matrix, then View, then the Projection. If you define `*` backwards, now you have to write:

    v*M*V*P = projectedPoint

Which makes it look like a row transformer (which you just went through a lot of trouble to fix). I think it’s pretty confusing doing the operation backwards. 

**But** here I am of two minds:

1. Defining `*` to be backwards is obviously wrong and is going to create much confusion for people who know matrix math.
2. Making it backwards does mean this breaking change should allow old code to work thus saving me a *lot* of time.

Ugh. Correctness or expediency? I really wish Apple hadn’t played that game. Again, I won’t die on this hill. But it seems so wrong to me.

@github I was under the impression that Mono didn't support single-file publishing. Was that wrong? Mono might want to change the behavior for AOT though.

In commit 53 you removed the following assert that used to be above this line:
```
Debug.Assert(!backingField.IsCreatedForFieldKeyword);
```
I am assuming that failing tests confirmed that the assert was incorrect. Since there was no suggestions to change behavior around when `BackingField` and `BackingFieldForFieldKeyword` return symbols (the suggestion was to prevent them returning different non-null values), then the answer is - yes, they both can return non-null value.

"> You'd expect these two types to be compatible since they'll always have the same sets of properties, but they wouldn't be without the simplification.

@github Sorry, would you mind clarifying that? Maybe with an example, or an explanation of what I'm doing wrong here:

```
type T1<T> = (keyof T) & string;
type T2<T> = keyof { [P in keyof T as P & string]: number };
//type T2<T> = keyof { [P in keyof T as [P] extends [P] ? P & string : never]: number };

interface M {
    a: number;
    b: number;
    [42]: number;
}

function f1(x: T1<M> extends T2<M> ? boolean : never) {
    return x;
}
function f2(x: T2<M> extends T1<M> ? boolean : never) {
    return x;
}
function f3(x: T1<M> extends T2<M> ? (T2<M> extends T1<M> ? boolean : never) : never) {
    return x;
}
f1(false);
f2(false);
f3(false);
```
In the above code, `f1` and `f2` both take `boolean` arguments, which *seems* to indicate that (as you said) T1 and T2 produce compatible types (each extends the other). But if I try to combine the tests, in `f3` it *doesn't* take boolean (it also doesn't tell me what it *does* take).

If I change the definition of `T2` so that the transformation doesn't happen (the commented out version of T2), I get exactly the same behavior (ie, I believe, based on `f1` and `f2`, that the types are still compatible; but something odd happens in the `f3` case)."

"Sure.  The case where this becomes a problem is when the assembly doesn't specify `.clearinitlocals`, which means that locals don't get initialized to zero.

I'm not sure how often `.clearinitlocals` is disabled - I suspect not super often, but just didn't want our guidance to end up sending folks in the wrong direction in this case."

"Yeah this change definitely doesn't look right to me because that client name is wrong 100% of the time. I think maybe we could use DI to solve this by having some default instance of HttpClient registered, or otherwise allow devs to specify other HttpClient settings via some other mechanism.

"Instead of validating the contents of the cache when we download bits from the network, can we validate them when we load them from the cache? Or as an asynchronous task that happens after we've downloaded and cached the resources? If we detect this situation, we can simply crash the app at that point, isn't that correct?

It is very unlikely that you end up in a situation where the manifest doesn't reflect the contents of the server or that you can't trust the manifest (it's your app, you are serving it).

Worst case scenario, your app is in the middle of a deployment and you got the wrong contents, the likely outcome is that your app will crash and the user will have to reload (this problem is orthogonal to what we are trying here).

If you want to do this validation, then do it over the cached data the first time you load from cache and ""repair"" purge the entry from the dll once you detect that scenario."

"I'm concerned ""auto-remove state on retrieval"" is a very strange pattern that will confuse people and make things harder for them. At the very least if we retain this behavior we should change the API name to something like `TryRetrieveAndRemovePersistedState`.

The sort of case where I think this risks making things difficult is if there are multiple instances of a component that make use of the same state. This auto-removal behavior means the developer is forced to invent a system for giving each of them unique keys that they can regenerate during rehydration.

Is there a strict reason why we have to do this? What goes wrong if we leave the state in place?"

~~You could get into this scenario via generic substitution though.~~ The spec says `void M<T>(T t!)` is allowed--the parameter just can't be constrained to a value type. ~~So it should probably be handled and exercised that way.~~ I don't think you can ever get into this scenario *during emit*, please correct me if I'm wrong @github

Still your advice makes sense if I'm wrong and the path with SocketHttpHandler will be taken mostly 🙂 (AFAIK it's a current XA behavior) but I think it makes sense to make Android one to be default.
"I might need to self block this - Looks like VtPipeTerm is _aggressively_ worse in this scenario actually. Since this is a replication of how WSL interop in conhost is supposed to work, this is a bad sign. I'll test more.

EDIT:
Okay I think I figured out what I did wrong here. It's the change to `screenInfo.cpp:L1451-1469`. Here we're trying to figure out the part of the viewport to invalidate, based off of what lines in the _new_ buffer are wrapped. This was supposed to be a heuristic on ""what lines that were wrapped that might have changed"". But that doesn't work - in the scenario where we're going from a wrapped line to a non-wrapped line, after the resize, all the contents of the buffer below the wrapped line will have shifted up one line. However, the problem with this algorithm is that we're only checking the wrap state at the end - which means that since there are _no_ wrapped lines in the new buffer, we never invalidate, and the host and terminal get out of sync.

I thought this was a bad heuristic originally, and I guess I'm glad that my gut was right about that.

my repro is essentially print a line that doesn't wrap, resize width down to have it wrap, then resize the width up to have the line unwrap. Chaos ensues."

"So this 0135 error is a bit similar to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/troubleshooting/mtouch-errors#MT0091 in the sense you want people to update their Xcode or enable the linker. I think you should copy or take inspiration from the detailed ""enable the linker"" explanation in 0091.

Also I have to admit that I'm a bit confused with the general wording of this error, not sure I understand.

If I go line by line:

> Did not link system framework '{0}' as Xcode SDK '{1}' is too old.

ok, couldn't, link Xcode too old.

> Xamarin.iOS contains API bindings for the listed framework which is newer than the Xcode used.

The framework is newer than the Xcode used? That sounds weird. I don't understand this.

> They may fail at runtime as we are not linking against the required system framework.

The listed framework may fail or the API bindings :P ? The error is about a system framework and it's also the last element of the previous sentence so I think that grammatically ""they"" applies to the listed frameworks (am I wrong?).

Overall I'm confused with those 2 middle sentences that are supposed to explain the core of the issue (maybe it's just me).

If I try really hard to parse this error I get that it's basically https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/troubleshooting/mtouch-errors#MT0091.
We can't ""link"" some frameworks because they are simply not available in the currently selected Xcode (too old). Some APIs in Xamarin.iOS depend on those frameworks (hence the error) and because we couldn't link them it's gonna fail at runtime. You can either upgrade Xcode to get the new framework or enable the linker so those APIs are skipped.

Anyway, we _might_ need to rephrase this, it's not crystal clear for me on the first read, it's very technical and hard to digest and I don't know if users will just understand this."

"This one's confusing me, so I'll try to explain the logic. Please correct me if I got it wrong:

The [rmdir docs](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rmdir.2.html) say:

```
ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.
```

So if we get ENOENT, it means the current entry is a symlink. And only if the current entry is the top level, we avoid deleting the contents of the link _target_ recursively. We achieve this by returning `true`, to assume the operation succedeed.

Was that correct?


But then, why do we throw (by going to default) if the current entry is not the top level?"
">> 4 tests failed, 103 tests passed.

I was wrong (same suites but different reasons or I opened the wrong log file). 

The failures are related to the PR and are still present in the last build (along new ones).

```
[FAIL] PreserveTypeWithCustomAttribute : type 
[FAIL] IntPtrSizeTest : empty body 
Tests run: 83 Passed: 81 Inconclusive: 0 Failed: 2 Ignored: 13
```

Those might have to be _adapted_ since the dotnet linker behave differently. Lack of custom preserve and how IntPtr.Size is removed.

The two ""new"" ones happens because the dynamic registrar is removed - but some tests are not happy (meaning something else is missing to make this work properly)."
"> This structure has nothing to do with stack. Is the comment wrong?

Yes.
I should add a macro at here, `prestup.cpp-Line:2363 #elif  defined(TARGET_ARM) || defined(TARGET_ARM64) || defined(TARGET_LOONGARCH64)`

But I also have a question.
Previous within the .NET6-runtime, the initialing code is in the file `src/coreclr/zap/zapimport.cpp:489`.
But now the zapimport.cpp had been deleted.
Not only the LoongArch64, the others architecturs also do nothing for initialing the m_rgCode.

"Vector restore happens at two places: 
- At the end of every block, whenever any `largeVectorVars` was partially spilled
- At the locations where we see the use

While it should be safe to eliminate the restores (and hence the saves) that happen for #1 above if the block is a THROW block, but there can be a scenario (as you pointed out) where eliminating save/restore will be wrong:

```asm
save(Vx)  ; <- shouldn't be eliminated because of the use
CALL ...
Vx = restore() ;  <- shouldn't be eliminated because of the use
 = use(Vx)
...
THROW
```

Since UpperVectorSave refpositions are created when we build kills, it is hard to look ahead to see which ones of them will be used (and hence restored) and thus can be eliminated. For e.g. in following case, we can (should) eliminate the unnecessary save/restore.

```asm
save(Vx)  ; <- safe to eliminate
CALL ...
Vx = restore() ;  <- safe to eliminate
...
THROW
```

To summarize, I was trying to eliminate vector saves, but it might not be safe (as Bruce pointed), so I will just try to at least eliminate the restore that happens at the end of the THROW block."

"I still think @github’s example is a _little_ suspicious with `--strictNullChecks` but without `--noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. The inheritance I think is immaterial; what we’re asking is, under what circumstances does it make sense to allow

```ts
interface Foo {
  [key: string]: string;
  foo?: string;
}
```

With _just_ `--strictNullChecks`, the type of the property signature of `foo` _is_ `string | undefined`, but reading an arbitrary string key will give you a `string`. Everyone knows that you’ll actually often get an `undefined` value at runtime (in absence of a Proxy or something), but our stance has always been one of _consistently_ ignoring the possibility of `undefined`—your other properties must be assignable to the index signature type, not the index signature type or `undefined`. That way, when you read an arbitrary key and get the result `string`, at least we don’t _know_ of any property names that would give you something different. This is a pretty weak defense in my opinion, but it’s the historical status quo. I think it wouldn’t be totally unreasonable to change our stance and allow optional properties alongside non-nullable index signatures. Then, when you read an arbitrary property and we give you a `string`, well, it’s wrong, but the undefined-ness of `foo?: string` doesn’t make it _more_ wrong than the undefined-ness of the infinite number of missing properties.

If we add `--noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, it starts to make more sense. Now, reading an arbitrary key of `Foo` will give you `string | undefined`, so the read type of the index signature and the read type of `foo?: string` agree. Having thought about it for a while now, I have no reservations about allowing this.

If we _also_ add `--strictOptionalProperties`, it feels like all the remaining holes can be plugged:

```ts
interface Foo1 {
  [key: string]: string;
  foo?: string; // ok, because like the index signature, this means if the property is present, its type is 'string'
}

interface Foo2 {
  [key: string]: string;
  foo?: string | undefined; // error, because unlike the index signature, this property may be set to 'undefined'
}

declare let dict: { [key: string]: string };
declare let foo1: { foo?: string };
declare let foo2: { foo?: string | undefined };

dict = foo1; // ok, because `foo` is 'string' if present
dict = foo2; // error, because it may introduce a present-but-undefined property
```

This gets to the essence of #41921—when you’re assigning an object with optional `string` properties to an object with a `string` index signature, we wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt that what you _mean_ is that those properties are either `string`s or _not present_. We had no way of enforcing that, and needed to reduce the breakiness of fixing #41418, so we chose to allow the unsoundness, given the rest of the unsoundness around index signatures. But if we had had a way to distinguish undefined and missing properties from the beginning, I think it would have worked the way I wrote it above. Unfortunately, the examples in that last code block really depend on _both_ `--noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `--strictOptionalProperties` being set to make sense, and I don’t know if it’s worth it in practice to treat that unique combination specially. But conceptually, it really does feel like they complement each other nicely and finally make sense out of the index signature story."

The developer could still support this if they wanted by adding their own handler for `ExternalNavigationStarting` and indicating that they want the URL to be opened in the webview (but this does seem like a bit of a hack IMO). Whereas, if we always loaded internal resources in the webview, I don't know that we have a way for the developer to override that behavior to support external navigation.

But there's something else: I think the existing fallback routing logic could still cause problems anyway for URLs ending in `.<something>`. I wonder if we should do something like re-processing the request as a navigation event if we fail to load an internal resource from the request URL (basically falling back to the host page if our initial guess was wrong).

From what I can tell AnsiBSTR, LPSTR, LPTSTR, and TBSTR are all partially wrong or unimplemented in netcore. AnsiBSTR only goes one way, LPSTR is treated as a UTF8STR for legacy reasons (not applicable in netcore), LPTSTR has this issue so I think I could cook up a test case that would cause a crash, and TBSTR only goes one way.

Sadly, only AnsiBSTR, BSTR, and LPSTR are covered by the CoreCLR tests right now, but I think I should be able to reuse the existing tests with the other types as well. There are a lot of interop-related test failures, but hopefully that will clear up any with the strings themselves."

I didn't even look at that.... I was looking at the last column with ""GPU Engine"" and watching it disappear. My theory would be that the GPU is wasting more time because it's receiving so much data off the bus after the CPU rasterizes it and that's what makes that spike. It's not like the GPU isn't involved in displaying the frames still.... it just isn't responsible for assembling them.

"So, a couple notes outside of the discussion about Solarized:

* This change was cherry-picked into the release branches (release-1.1 at cb52de02e70b8872471db39e4945d560f8736d29, release-1.2 at ccf201fe440fd8163115f8630eb4a0529d420f50), and the tags are made on the commits in the release branches.
* #293 is fixed to the best of our ability
   * James fixed color representation through the entire stack, which exacerbated an issue in PowerShell (PowerShell/PSReadline#830)
   * Because of that issue, we broke `40` _specifically for PowerShell_ (#6810). This is very narrowly targeted. Once the change that fixes PowerShell/PSReadline#830 (PowerShell/PSReadline#1626) has a wider install base, we'll revert the workaround and `40` will work fine.

---

You're right that we're not following Solarized's ""canonical"" color mappings... but neither is gnome-terminal. Generally, though, I'm concerned about this:

> ""your dark background has the wrong brightness relationship ...""

That's fair and well-specified from a Solarized standpoint, but any other terminal would consider the default Solarized mappings to have the wrong brightness relationship between ""black"" and ""bright black"". Nobody has strictly defined that ""bright black"" must indeed be brighter than ""black"", but it's right there in the name.

I'm checking `base02` on `base03` because we _do_ see that color combination in the wild. PowerShell's default configuration prints `90` on `49` (or `90` on `40` in traditional consoles predating Windows 10). If we use [cmd-colors-solarized](https://github.com/shanselman/cmd-colors-solarized) _or_ the official upstream mapping, that means printing one base color on another base color.

Personally I'd rather yank all reference to Solarized from this repo forever than move color indices back and forth for all time, but that doesn't mean I'm not amenable to discussing it :smile:"
The entire rid is already included. I think it’s more useful to look at the entire string rather than a single character. It’s wrong in context not on its own.
"Ok, revisited the PR. Again, downloaded the branch and here's what I'm seeing (numbers refer to the points from [this comment](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/pull/11153#pullrequestreview-760344068)):
1. `moveFocus` by `parent` passes the key down to the active terminal there is no parent.
   - [Resolution] ✅ Discussion showed I was wrong about the expected behavior. This works as expected!
2. `search`
   - [Resolution] 🏈🦶 punted to #11327 
3. `sendInput`/`copy`/`paste`: 
   - [Resolution] 🏈🦶 punted to #11327
4. `closePane`: Still cool 😉
5. `moveFocus`: I expected to see the focus move to another group of panes, but idk if that's even possible given the current infrastructure?
   - [Resolution] 🏈🦶 punted to #11327
6. `togglePaneZoom`:It feels a bit weird that you can only move focus using the mouse. `moveFocus` here makes the newly focused pane be the only one that's zoomed. Curious what others think of this, and if there's an ""expected behavior"" that I can't put my finger on (heck, this might be the correct behavior 🤷).
   - [Resolution] 🏈🦶 punted to #11327
7. `resizePane`: Still love it! 🥳
8. `toggleReadOnlyMode`: If we have a mix of states, we toggle on each of them. That seems right based on the action's name, but I wonder if the user would prefer one of these two ideas:
   - (1) toggle the top-left pane state, and make all other selected panes match that new state.
         - Inspiration: this is how MS Word handles text formatting with mixed states (i.e. ""hello world"" where one word is underlined and the other one isn't; if it's all selected and you press <kbd>ctrl+u</kbd>, we toggle the first run's state, then make the rest match it)
   -  (2) introduce a `setReadOnlyMode` action? (I like this idea less btw)
   - [Resolution] ~🏈🦶 punted to #11327~ EDIT: It's already done!!
9. `splitPane`: ❌ Still seeing this crash ☹️
10. `scrollUp`/`scrollDown`/etc...: I expect the scroll commands to be sent to each of the terminals.
   - [Resolution] 🏈🦶 punted to #11327
11. `adjustFontSize`/`resetFontSize`: works perfectly! 🙌
12. `toggleShaderEffects`
    - ❌ broken, but differently. Now, if a subtree of 4 panes are selected, the 3 non-active panes toggle properly, but the active pane flashes then does nothing. I invoked it using the command palette, if that does anything.
13. `setColorScheme`
    - ❌ broken (same as before) the new scheme isn't _previewed_, it does properly set it after you select it, however. Seems to flash? Works on `main`.

Still want (9), (12), and (13) though fixed since (9) is a crash and (12)/(13) are regressions. After those get fixed, I'll approve and we'll merge this 🙂"

"Unfortunately this part becomes a bit complicated.

We can't do this, because it will make the api diffs for legacy Xamarin wrong (in fact this should be bumped to the apidiff reference from the `xcode13-ios` branch now).

However, we can't bump to the bundle.zip from the `xcode13-ios` branch, because it won't contain binaries for Xamarin.Mac (nor the .NET assemblies for that matter).

We really need a different bundle.zip for every platform, but for legacy Xamarin that's out of scope for this PR.

But what is possible is a middle ground: use a different url for .NET assemblies, and even better would be to make it possible to use a different url for each platform, so something like this:

```make
APIDIFF_REFERENCES_DOTNET_iOS=...
APIDIFF_REFERENCES_DOTNET_tvOS=...
APIDIFF_REFERENCES_DOTNET_macOS=...
APIDIFF_REFERENCES_DOTNET_MacCatalyst=...

I'm arguing that it's useful to get the second error message, to more quickly determine what went wrong.

There's also the scenario where you refactor such that an interface you implement no longer needs you to implement `method`. With `override` on implementing methods, you'll get an error for code that's no longer useful."

"> What if you're not in the codestyle layer? Can you still use these? Should you? Would it be bug if you used the wrong one?

You can use any of the overloads that are available in the particular layer. The overloads are mostly for convenience, so that starting from a Document you can easily get the options needed. 

The only decision to make is whether it makes sense to read the options eagerly (using XyzOptions) or whether they need to be read lazily (using a XyzOptionsProvider). The former is preferred in code that operates on a single document. Then you can parameterize that feature with specific options and read them upfront. If a feature operates on multiple documents that potentially come from different projects then you have to use the provider since we do not want to load specific language binaries upfront if they won't actually be used. If there is a performance concern with reading options from editorconfig documents upfront (perhaps a feature only needs the options rare cases) then you can also use the provider pattern.

TL;dr `publish` fails on any blazorwasm project with VS17

A recent commit[1] moved initializing `$(_WasmIntermediateOutputPath)` from
a target, to project level `PropertyGroup`. It is set as:

`<_WasmIntermediateOutputPath>$([MSBuild]::NormalizeDirectory($(IntermediateOutputPath), 'wasm'))</_WasmIntermediateOutputPath>`

The `NormalizeDirectory` call converts this to a full path, presumably
using the current directory.

Because we are setting `$(_WasmIntermediateOutputPath)` at the project
level, it gets evaluated during the evaluation phase. And the current
directory doesn't seem to be set to the project directory at that point
in VS. So, `$(_WasmIntermediateOutputPath)` gets a wrong path like:

`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Preview\Common7\IDE\obj\Release\net6.0\wasm`.

And then when actually publishing, it fails to create this directory
with:

`Unable to create directory ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Preview\Common7\IDE\obj\Release\net6.0\wasm\"". Access to the path 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Preview\Common7\IDE\obj\Release\net6.0\wasm\' is denied.`

Fix:
Set the property in `_InitializeCommonProperties` *target*, at which
point the current directory is correctly set.

Note:
- This doesn't seem to be reproducible outside VS
- It happens only on `publish`, because that's when the wasm targets
  come into play.

Who knows. I sometimes do crazy things. Cleaning up.
"Formatting is wrong here and it using spaces, "
"I confirm this issue is in the Java implementation on the Android DateTimePicker.

Here is a short Kotlin snippet that reproduces the issue:

```kt
package com.example.myapplication

import android.app.DatePickerDialog
import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.fragment.app.Fragment
import android.view.LayoutInflater
import android.view.View
import android.view.ViewGroup
import androidx.navigation.fragment.findNavController
import com.example.myapplication.databinding.FragmentFirstBinding

/**
 * A simple [Fragment] subclass as the default destination in the navigation.
 */
class FirstFragment : Fragment() {

    private var _binding: FragmentFirstBinding? = null
    private var _dialog: DatePickerDialog? = null

    // This property is only valid between onCreateView and
    // onDestroyView.
    private val binding get() = _binding!!

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {

        _binding = FragmentFirstBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        return binding.root

    }

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)

        binding.buttonFirst.setOnClickListener {
            if (_dialog == null) {
                _dialog = DatePickerDialog(this.requireActivity())
            }
            _dialog!!.updateDate(2000, 1, 1)
            _dialog!!.show()
        }
    }

    override fun onDestroyView() {
        super.onDestroyView()
        _binding = null
    }
}
```

This snippet can be used to replace the `FirstFragment.kt` that is generated by the Android Studio Basic Activity template and reproduce the issue.

The important line here is the call to `updateDate`. If we didn't have that call, the calendar will show up as usual, but it will be on the month we left the DatePicker, instead of the selected Date.

Before we talk about the underlying code, let's start with a rough idea. The `DatePickerDialog` contains a `DatePicker`. A `DatePicker` interacts with a `ViewPager`, the idea is that the calendar for each month is a `Page` (or an `Item` in the code). Changing the date is essentially changing the `Item`.

When the `_dialog!!.updateDate(...)` is called, the underlying code will eventually reach [here](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/ebddedfd9b4380607eed95decbe5178516bca976/core/java/com/android/internal/widget/ViewPager.java#L523) to `setCurrentItemInternal`. For the very first call, the `mFirstLayout` flag is true, so it will do the right thing and put the calendar in.

For the later call, if we happen to be on the same page, the condition check [here](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/c5d02da0f6553a00da6b0d833b67d3bbe87341e0/core/java/android/widget/DayPickerView.java#L311) will fail and nothing happens, it stays good.

However, if the user flipped to the other months but quit the dialog, then the condition would turn `true`, leading to a call to `setCurrentItemInternal`, the `mFirstLayout` is no longer true, so it will actually call `populate` [here](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/ebddedfd9b4380607eed95decbe5178516bca976/core/java/com/android/internal/widget/ViewPager.java#L535).

It would have been fine if `populate` actually does it job, but it doesn't. Perhaps because we called that while the `DatePicker` is not currently on the screen, the `windowToken` is `null` and the actual work to set the item is by-passed [here](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/com/android/internal/widget/ViewPager.java#L927). Worse, the item is updated, so we don't have a second chance to get it fixed, that why the calendar is empty.

This concludes the root cause of the bug. I don't know why it worked on previous versions, the files I mentioned above were not changed for at least 2 years.

As an experiment, we can replicate what we did in the Android experiment and comment out the setting of the `Date` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/blob/cf2dc1937f18896b878b5ed08f56dc7445618abd/src/Core/src/Handlers/DatePicker/DatePickerHandler.Android.cs#L142). With that, we can get the behavior just like we would get in Kotlin. Basically, the calendar will show up, but not on the current month.

I think we should [file an issue](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/report-bugs) against Android at least. 

With respect to our code, there are a few things we could do:

1. Do nothing, wait until the Android people fix the bug, it will not work perfectly for some phones. Hopefully, it wouldn't be long until they fix it so the number of phones got impacted is limited.
2. Comment out the `setDate`. The calendar will show the wrong page (but the users flipped it there), or
3. Set it `null`, we will have the perfect behavior, but that comes with a performance penalty and code complexities to handle it could `null` in many places.

If I knew how to specialize in API version, we can also specialize the comment out of the `updateDate` only for the broken API versions, that way we will have the perfect behavior most of the time and not have a performance penalty. That would be my choice."

"I can't tell what you're advocating for; your comments contradict each other.

The pattern you're citing from MSDN is exactly what's already happening in that current code, except that their version sets the `disposed` flag to true after executing the `if(disposing)` block instead of before. (Whether it's better to set that flag before or after is a separate discussion, but I believe that ""before"" is the safer option.)

> When you call Dispose(false), it sets _disposed to true but does NOT actually dispose (the if block doesn't get executed).

""the if block doesn't get executed"" is not the same thing as ""does not dispose"". The `if(disposing)` block is for cleaning up managed resources when our code calls `Dispose()`. We can't clean up managed resources during `Dispose(false)` because we're being finalized, and the state of the managed resources is indeterminate. (It wouldn't do much good anyway, since by this point they're likely being garbage collected.)

> When you call Dispose(true) later on, it assumes the object is already disposed, so it returns.

That's not a thing. `Dispose(false)` signals that the finalizer is calling `Dispose()`; the object is being destroyed/finalized. There is no subsequent call to `Dispose(true)`. 

The converse is also true; if `Dispose(true)` has been called, `Dispose(false)` never happens, because the root class's `Dispose()` implementation calls `GC.SuppressFinalize()`.

> MasterDetailPageRenderer.cs and NavigationPageRenderer.cs have the correct implementation.

Their implementations are subtly wrong. In both, if `Dispose()` is called by the finalizer (i.e., `Dispose(false)`), `_disposed` will never be set to true, and nothing will prevent a double-Dispose situation. In those two classes we happen to be fine because there are no unmanaged resources to handle (i.e., nothing outside of the `if(disposing)` block), so no disposal logic gets run multiple times. We _are_ incurring a slight performance penalty, though, and that's something I hope to fix soon.

We should trace to see what call is bad.  "
"Again, no problemo. I only added it as it was in the spec. Did I read the spec wrong or is the spec wrong? Either way, the enum doesn't deserialize as specified in the spec. But that's a moot point if we're just gonna drop the thing anyway. "
"Not a fan, also they are in the wrong order"
"Copying the comment I made in the commit related to panel part

I think this is still not a proper solution because I observed that context menu actions on panel title is not showing hidden views. 

So I took back a step and looked into our views framework and I see we have following top level pieces 

- CompositeBar (ActivityBar & PanelBar) 
- ViewPaneContainers (Viewlets & Panels)
- [ViewDescriptors](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/88e98034a84ecbf65b7650f664a73a990457120a/src/vs/workbench/common/views.ts#L210) & [ViewsModel](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/88e98034a84ecbf65b7650f664a73a990457120a/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/views/views.ts#L325)

If we separate these into Model & UI sections

- **Model:** ViewDescriptors & ViewsModel
- **UI:** CompositeBar and ViewPaneContainers

I felt that it's wrong that state is flowing between UI pieces. Instead we shall have the state in the model and let UI pieces update with model changes. 
It means UI parts need access to `ViewsModel`. So here is my idea:

- Have only one model `ViewDescriptors` that contain all information about view descriptors (all, active, visible).
- All UI pieces use this model to render icons, titles, actions & views.

We can discuss in detail directly.

(It’s also the sort of assumption that could plausibly be violated by a bizarre sequence of edits triggering some race condition, or just wrong code, so we do see assertions like this come up in telemetry every once in a while.)"
I still run `gulp local`. Is that wrong?
"I generally agree with Cyrus here. If I recall the low memory situation correctly, there's a specific problem (you have low memory) and a specific solution (we'll turn off global analysis). In this situation we don't know what's wrong and since it's an implementation detail, not a feature, it's not clear what we're going to be doing. I think we'd be better off saying something more general like what Cyrus suggested.

"@github There are two failing tests left and it appears to go wrong in SimplifyInterpolation/Helpers.cs. The string literal argument to `ToString` in `$""""prefix {someValue.ToString(""g"")} suffix""""` does not have a constant value according to IOperation even though the syntax is LiteralExpressionSyntax `""g""`. Still confirming."
"This condition looks wrong. Did you mean `if (compilerOptions.jsx === JsxEmit.None)`
"
"I agree with you, I think that the write value of `emitSerializedReturnTypeOfNode` (`void 0`) is the right one when a function has no return type declared; instead, with this fix, `emitSerializedNode` will always write ""Object"", that could be wrong in some situation. Maybe we could enforce the null check in `emitSerializedNode` (as we did with this fix) **and** each caller should emit the right output by handling the undefined value itself. What do you think about this?
"
RWC tests look good (two implicit any errors disappeared in favor of actual types). DT tests are clean. Community tests show a new error in `webpack` which is correct (type annotations appear to be wrong).
"> This is regression to 3.1 caused by #41490

Looks like wrong issue?"
"It turns out that the parser does the right thing, it's just that for purposes of the completion, `location` is the `<` token, as we are completing after it. Before, this had a display kind of `jsxAttribute`, hence the bug.

I pushed a change that adds a JSX tag name kind, however I still thing this isn't quite right as technically, the query is asking about the `<` token, which is not itself a tag name. But, before, it was an attribute, which is still wrong too, so I'm going to look harder."
"This feels really wrong :confused: 

The proposal explicitly says that [import assertions must not affect how a module is evaluated or resolved](https://tc39.es/proposal-import-assertions/#sec-hostresolveimportedmodule):
> [...]
> The implementation of HostResolveImportedModule must conform to the following requirements:
> - [...]
> - moduleRequest.[[Assertions]] must not influence the interpretation of the module or the module specifier; instead, it may be used to determine whether the algorithm completes normally or with an [abrupt completion](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-completion-record-specification-type).

In other words, if both these two imports succeed they must resolve/evaluate the same file:
```js
import { A } from ""pkg"" assert { ""resolution-mode"": ""require"" };
import { A } from ""pkg"" assert { ""resolution-mode"": ""import"" };
```

The imports assertions proposal [even mentions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions#follow-up-proposal-evaluator-attributes) a possible follow-up proposal that would allow what you need, but it would be a separate proposal (with likely different syntax).

I know that this PR is only about `import type` so it's technically ""just TS"" and not JS, but actively going against the JS semantics should be discouraged."
"Oh dear. The bot applied the wrong tag. It should be `area-System.Numerics.Tensors`. "

In the [latest documentation porting PR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs/pull/8185), I had to manually pull out the isolated `<seealso>` items from the remarks section, otherwise they would show in a confusing way in MS Docs.

The `<seealso>` items can be added without problems at the same level as the rest of the usual comment items.

I am doing this in source too so that the next porting processes do not port the wrong remarks again.

"> Should this be embedded into the dll or stored in the app package ""assets"" system? Not sure of the perf here. Probably better in the dll as we do not have to touch the filesystem - but I may be wrong. @github once the dll is loded into memory on Android, is it fully loaded, or will this still read off disk? Are there any pros/cons with embedded resources vs assets?

My initial thoughts on `appsettings.json`, is that ASP.NET uses it as a file so you can edit the file on disk after a service is deployed -- or use environment variables.

This isn't practical at all in a mobile app -- users don't open files on disk and edit values or set environment variables. Does `appsettings.json` even make sense for a mobile app? Would you be better off hardcoding settings as a `const string`? If that is the case, we should just document how to do this and plug into the ASP.NET infrastructure so you just use C# `const` values."
you mean `foreach` I guess. I thought a `for` loop was more performant here but it looks like I was wrong.
Should this just be merged with `AddStackPolicy`? The naming seems wrong.

this seems wrong. @github ?
For the moment I think I'm okay with unsealing this class. We will need to evaluate the other renderers to make sure there isn't a reason this could go wrong.
Suggestion: `ProcessFrame` --> `RefreshTimestamp`. Or am I reading this function wrong?

"You're absolutely right. Unfortunately, this entire function is just all sorts of wrong (see #4507).

Actually..... we would consider that block to be wrong. It should have had the English error text there. I bet @github created that `.vcxproj` when working on the u8u16 converters and VS inserted the text in the bottom in German per his locale and we didn't notice. It's just our practice to have everything be in English as that's our company's working language. (Except where necessary like with some example German text for a test scenario or something...)
"> It's possible I'm remembering part of this wrong but pretty much whenever u have to depend on the ordering of writes between threads there is usually this type of gap.

>I think there is a race then. Even if we use the barrier to ensure the thread can't reorder it's reads of _flags and _managedKindUseSiteDiagnostics we can't guarantee the visibility of the writes from the other thread are both visible.

"@github Can you verify that you un-selected `move on type`, and not `search on type`?

There is an unrelated, pre-existing setting `search on type` that has no effect.  

The reason I ask is that @github confirmed it worked in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/60977#issuecomment-611107740 , and this PR is the same as my original, just behind a setting, so I thought maybe you just ticked the wrong one.

I think it will just do nothing when it's null. I can be wrong though. :-) And I wouldn't know what to do when it would crash. Do I need to throw a specific exception that is handled elsewhere?

You're not wrong. I just happened to be looking to fix multiple open issues so the runtime text that took 2 minutes and the window state tracking that took an afternoon ended up in the same PR.

"Not critical but your indentation is incorrect :)

Now to be really useful the logic needs to be a bit more complex. In contrast to API you can always use a missing value, e.g. `Call ((MyEnum)42))`, so a missing member is not critical (as much as other things) since it's not blocking (just annoying). Also adding them later is not a breaking change...

The most important thing for enum members is their values, e.g. if we have `MissingMember = 43` while the right value is `42`. That's very hard to diagnose such errors (and easy to get wrong since, most of the time, the values are assigned automatically by the C# compiler). It's also a breaking change to fix them."
"Disclaimer: not a corecontributor, so I may be completely wrong.

This could probably be done by including a custom method, similarly to how NSString2.cs and NSObject.mac.cs do with partial classes.

"I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how this API is supposed to be used... and I can't quite figure it out, but I'm pretty sure this is wrong :smile:.

I /think/ that slot 0 in ex_data is pre-wired to know that it's storing an `SSL*`, so if we called `SSL_dup` on this `SSL*` then as part of duplicating the EX_DATA portion it'll call `SSL_dup` on the value stored in this slot... which is bad if it's a GCHandle.

It might be OK to use slot 13 (CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_APP), but I'm not sure.  Every usage of this that I see within OpenSSL code always calls `SSL_get_ex_new_index` first, to associate an allocator/deallocator/duplicator with what is going to go into the slot.  Then they get back a number and need to remember that as their slot ID.

I think we should strive to avoid using the EX_DATA, since it's not easily understood."
What happens when someone actually targets `net4.8-windows` or even does something like `net4.8-unix`?  Might be helpful to have a hard block on that just to prevent people from doing it since it will give the wrong thing for P2Ps as well.
"these changes are desirable.

"Am I reading it wrong, or does the comment not match the code? The code looks like it's distinguishing between no declarations, from single or multiple declarations. Shouldn't it check count of declarations?"

"For analyzers in particular, acquiring an expensive resource might best be done in Initialize rather than in a constructor, because the instance might be constructed only to determine that the analyzer will not be used (due to all of its diagnostics being suppressed).

The point I was trying to make is that things might go wrong for some analyzers if we don't obey the specified contract. Debating whether a particular way things might go wrong could be avoided by changing the design of an analyzer is not going to resolve the issue.

"Actually, these implementations are wrong.  They should be removed until the right behaviors can be implemented.  It's not ok to cancel the wait but not cancel the actual operation that's in flight."
"It looks like my change in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/64720 broke the argument exception that was previously being thrown by GetDescriptor.  Previously, the second argument would be used in the ArgumentNullException GetDescriptor would throw, but now it's ignored, and the name in the ArgumentNullException will sometimes be wrong.  I think we either need to:
1) Change all of the call sites to use !! as appropriate, or
2) Fix GetDescriptor to again use the second argument as the exception parameter name... the parameter could be changed to be a CallerArgumentExpression string."
Added a Debug.fail. I agree it's best not to silently do the wrong thing if we get into this weird state.
"I think a more reliable mechanism would be to:
1. Recursively walk up each containing class (via `getContainingClass`) until you find a class that declares a private name with `privateNameDescription`.
2. If `leftType` does not have a property with that name, then
  1. Get the properties of `leftType` and see if it has *any* private named member with the same description, if one is found then use that information to report an error about the wrong private name.

"`getNameOfDeclaration` is still going to return the wrong thing, though; unless I overload it for `LateBoundBinaryExpressionDeclaration` to return a more specific result?"
"Hmm, I just copied this comment from `services/types.ts`. But, now that you mention it, we do the wrong thing in this case 😱. I guess I’ll open a new bug."
"I think this is probably the wrong place for this, but wanted to get some opinions. My first instinct was to make `module.exports = { foo }` recognized by the binder as something special, but that got complicated and blew up very quickly. I could just move this to `importFixes`, but was never really satisfied with having to look so closely at syntax at this point."
"Yeah, as stated in the meeting I do think this is not a reasonable new error in a quite old test (and was dealt with in the prior iteration of this change), and this can be somewhat easily avoided by using the old behavior for named function expressions (which are generally only used when you want recursive references like this anyhow). A self-call witnessing the unwidened type is _very_ odd, given our widening rules (no exterior calls can witness the unwidened type). I think this can manifest in even _stranger_ behavior if you do something with the `bar` reference rather than just call it - like pass it into a function desiring a callback, eg `handle(bar)` where `declare function handle(a: () => [any]): void`, or worse yet `declare function handle<T>(a: T): T` where the unwidened type will simply propagate via inference - where then you'll get this widening error so far removed from anything that it's relevant to that it's quite clear something's gone wrong."
"The private exception purposefully has a different full name (since it is nested). So we would need to check 2 different ""full names"".

Even full names wouldn't prevent some other code running in a Host ""Build()"" sequence naming their exception `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.HostAbortedException`. So it isn't a guaranteed solution either.

If, for some reason, someone else names their exception `HostAbortedException`, and it isn't the one we threw below, the caller will get `null` back from `HostFactoryResolver.ResolveServiceProviderFactory`, and it will handle it just like any other case where the IServiceProvider can't be found (usually displaying a message to the user saying something went wrong)."
"There are two main reasons for some of this weird ""handlings"", but it doesn't excuse most of them:
* Cecil's reference->definition resolution returns null if the resolution fails (missing assembly dependency, wrong dependency, ...). So unlike in NativeAOT's type system, there are potentially lot of places where null can appear unfortunately.
* Historically we've seen quite a few cases where weird IL/metadata we never anticipated (like obfuscated code) crashed the linker. While I agree it's easy to diagnose the problem, there's typically absolutely no workaround for the user (other than disabling trimming which in Blazor/Xamarin scenarios is not really viable).

We are guilty of adding `?.` and similar in places where we couldn't immediately reason about the input being null or not. This is exaggerated by the fact that we turned on nullable reference types (which was a good thing as it found several issues), but Cecil is not annotated, so everything looks nullable (even if in really it might not be)."
"Took me a while to notice this and to understand what goes wrong.  It's because when the test runs it tries to load the assembly twice - once with an older version - which succeeds, and subsequently with a newer version.  Evidently Mono isn't doing a version check when the assembly has already been loaded.  I filed an issue https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/38351

> A type roll-forward test I added for configuration manager types was failing on Mono. Mono always resolves the type, even if we ask for a future version. I've skipped for Mono for the test for now.
> 
> @github Is this type behavior expected, or do you know who would know? The test ultimately does a `Type.GetType` for `""System.Configuration.UserSettingsGroup, System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager, Version=255.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51""`.

"Turns out `EscapeUnescapeIri` was not incrementing the index when escaping a surrogate pair. That led to the low surrogate being escaped again, producing wrong results and hitting the fallback-path in Utf8Encoding (that allocates).

"I have no concern with the comments.  My concern is with calling task.Wait.  That is innapropriate and we should simply 'await' here to get the right behavior.  By calling 'Wait' we now have to deal with audting this code every time we go through looking for blocking calls in async methods.  .Wait in an async context is traditionally a large red flag that something is wrong.  That auditing will waste time and make this code different for no valuable reason. 

The appropriate thing to do here is to just 'await' the task like we would in pretty much all other code.  

Now, personally, that code is clear enough that it should need no comment.  But i have no problem with the code calling out why it does `await task.ConfigureAwait(false)` rather than just `task.Result`.

"I'm a little confused here. It sounds like the test is doing the wrong thing, but even if the test is buggy, it shouldn't be able to crash the runtime like this.  Doesn't this suggest there's also a bug in either System.Drawing.Common, libgdiplus, or mono?"
"Regarding: 
> // Hence, we return preallocated System.Exception instance. Lossy information is better 
 // than wrong or no information (or even FailFast).

My reasoning is that since we cannot provide the ""right"" exception, because we cannot allocate it, giving OOM would be fairly truthful - we are in a state where we cannot function normally because of memory shortage.

User can try handle the situation by trimming memory use or at least will see OOM in Watson/dump and have a bit more info about environment at the time of the crash.

Wrong manual updating of assembly version has led to lot of problems for the upstack repo. This change automatically applies the versioning rules and calculates the assembly version

- No package project -> no change in assembly version & package version.
- Package project Exists -> always increment the package version.
- Package project Exists and part of any shared framework -> assembly version increment for netfx assets only
- Package project Exists and not part of any shared framework -> assembly version increment for all assets
- Baseline version is updated everytime so we done need to update the assemblyPackage version  table.
- Stable version and list of packages to be build should be updated everytime. 


Validation
Manually verified all the servicing packages for the assembly version changes being correctly produced.

It seems like ordering of the additionalCertificates X509Certificate2Collection is not quite predicable as I assumed. 
With that the validation callback can get wrong certificate and/or incomplete chain. 

With this change we would always get peer certificate from PlatformCertificateHandle and we would add all extra certificates to ChainPolicy.ExtraStore. That may contain peer certificate it self but it does not matter as that is just hint and chain.Build will create the chain as needed. 

I aslo added ITestOutputHelper to the test so it is easier to collect useful information on test failures.

"I think I'm going to close this until after .NET 6 peels off of main, and likewise not pursue moving ECC fully to EVP_PKEY in this release (ECC was giving me some trouble, anyways).

When running this change with OpenSSL 3.0 the DSA tests which try to export a public key with private parameters fail with an OutOfMemoryException.  Why? Well, because the (mostly generated) code walks down a path, does `ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_PROV, ERR_R_NOT_A_PRIVATE_KEY)` (the error we want), then down an error handling path goes ""oh, building that interior piece failed, clearly we're out of memory `ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_PROV, ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE)` (not the error we want), and then no other error happened.  So we exit CryptoNative_GetPkcs8PrivateKeySize with an error stack of `{ LIB_PROV|NOT_A_PRIVATE_KEY, LIB_PROV|MALLOC_FAILURE }`.  Our logic is to take the last (newest) error, and if it's MALLOC_FAILURE that we report an OutOfMemoryException.

Trying to rewind my brain 5 years, I'm pretty sure we take the last error because of all the places that we decide there was an error and we move on anyways without clearing it, and this was partly because of the expense of interacting with the error state in OpenSSL 0.9.8 and 1.0.x (with 1.1.0 (IIRC) it moved to a thread-local thing and got much less costly).  What this error shows is that we're just out of touch and need to rethink exception processing for OpenSSL.

I /think/ that what we want is:

* ERR_clear_error() at the start of each operation.
* Change our current ""keep asking what the error is until we run out"" to something like `long CryptoNative_GetErrorForException(out int handlerFlags)` ((HandlerFlag)0x01 being ""OutOfMemoryException""), which takes the **oldest** and clears the error queue, the logic being that the first thing that went wrong since we started is obviously ""the thing that went wrong"".  (Maybe there'll be edge cases that say this also isn't always the right answer, though... but I hope not)

Because this is a pretty fundamental change in how we're interopping I think we want to make sure there's a chance to see if something complicated goes wrong, which means we want it in a preview release we can get good feedback on.  And that means it's probably .NET 7 Preview 1.

---

The alternative is that we just say ""eh, let's only throw OOM if that was the oldest error in the queue"", but that feels like we're just missing the point and kicking the can a bit.

I don't insist on INTERNAL. Do you have other candidates on mind @github ?"
"The host has some code in it which detects arm64 hardware and changes behavior slightly based on that. So it actually does make a difference if it's running on arm64 or x64 hardware. And since the host tests do weird things with the host, I would not be surprised if this has an effect. Especially if the global install is 5.0 only which is not arm64 aware (which is BTW another problem with this setup) - after 6.0 GA we will also release an update to 5.0 which will be arm64 aware. In fact I think we will block installing 5.0 SDK on arm64 hardware (only runtime will be OK, but it installs into a different location), but I could be wrong.

Another problem will be that these images have .NET 2.1 SDK on them - those are out of support and are absolutely not supported on arm64 macs - we will have updated 3.1 and 5.0 installers, but AFAIK there are no plans to update the 2.1 installers. So trying to install the 2.1 on arm64 hardware will effectively break all .NET installs after the GA refresh.

## Customer Impact

This PR actually fixes two bugs.

The first one is a bug reported by customer via email, where an async read operation performed on a `FileStream` opened for **non-seekable device** file was throwing an `System.IO.IOException`: ""The parameter is incorrect"".

It turns out that `ReadFile` [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile#parameters) was wrong:

> For an hFile that does not support byte offsets, Offset and OffsetHigh are ignored.

And `OVERLAPPED` [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped#members) was right:

> This member is nonzero only when performing I/O requests on a seeking device that supports the concept of an offset (also referred to as a file pointer mechanism), such as a file. Otherwise, this member **must be zero**.

The second bug is #58383. To tell the long story short, `File.ReadAllBytes*(string path, ...)` methods were assuming that `path` can't point to a non-seekable file like named pipe.

## Testing

The fix was verified using tests added in the PR. It has been in main for a month (#58434) and we have already been doing that for sync file handles (the issue was originally discovered and fixed by @github):

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/cf7d5173d4d9ce0aac8212e78063a097e1f57c0a/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/RandomAccess.Windows.cs#L723-L732

"> Why are you setting `%NUGET_PACKAGES%`?

...though to a large extent, this is a pointless question and shouldn't actually *matter*; it's a documented environment variable, with documented semantics, and the xamarin-android build *should not break* ""just because"" this value is set (""within reason"", poorly defined).

A ""spit-balled"" solution is to update `Configuration.props` with:

```xml
<XAPackagesDir Condition="" '$(XAPackagesDir)' == '' And '$(NUGET_PACKAGES)' != '' "">$(NUGET_PACKAGES)</XAPackagesDir>
<XAPackagesDir Condition="" '$(XAPackagesDir)' == '' And '$(OS)' == 'Windows' "">$(userprofile)\.nuget\packages</XAPackagesDir>
<XAPackagesDir Condition="" '$(XAPackagesDir)' == '' And '$(OS)' != 'Windows' "">$(HOME)/.nuget/packages</XAPackagesDir>
```

Then use `$(XAPackagesDir)` instead of hardcoding `$(XamarinAndroidSourcePath)\packages`.

Which works with 2 seconds thought, but...  If someone then edits `NuGet.config` to override `globalPackagesFolder`, things will break (differently), as `$(XAPackagesDir)` won't match the `globalPackagesFolder` within `NuGet.config`.

😞

A slightly different take might be to use:

```xml
<XAPackagesDir Condition="" '$(XAPackagesDir)' == '' And '$(NUGET_PACKAGES)' != '' "">$(NUGET_PACKAGES)</XAPackagesDir>
<XAPackagesDir Condition="" '$(XAPackagesDir)' == '' >$(XamarinAndroidSourcePath)\packages</XAPackagesDir>
```

and continue to rely on the `globalPackagesFolder` value, though this approach still doesn't deal well with `NuGet.config` changes without corresponding build system changes, e.g. updating the `CheckApiCompatibility.ApiCompatPath` property value, which just feels ""wrong""."

In this crazy new world, profile generators would make profiles available to the user, but we would neither (1) automatically put them in the user's ""resultant set of profiles"" nor (2) hide them once we put them there.

In general, and I am happy to be disabused of this notion, we consider `profiles.list` to be _the user's property._ Anything we put in there, we have given them, and cannot take back or later change. Even the `hidden` ones. That's the only model we have today for generated profiles!

If we change the model to make those profiles available, but we do not automatically promote them (put them in the user's possession) and instead give them the option to do so... we can have a nearly infinite number of profile generators--we could even rename them to ""detectors"" or whatever--that the user could opt in for."

Agree with this being a fragile design. It predates me, it existed for several years and apparently it worked just fine. Even though this is hard to get right without understanding RID compatibility rules, it's the closest / best implementation based on the rid graph.

> Transform all net461 configs to instead be net461-windows, that way all configurations are referencing the right live libs.

Reason why we didn't do this yet is because of these two major downsides:
- Making a tfm rid specific without also building a rid agnostic tfm of the same TargetFrameworkIdentifier results in  packages having duplicated assets in the i.e. lib/net461/ and runtimes/win/lib/net461/ folders. For more information see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/c94b75f662030a09c8747d79a16d9f4f2c9d44f1/eng/packaging.targets#L104-L108.
- net461-windows is a tfm alias that nuget doesn't understand and the `-windows` part needs to be stripped from the target framework alias: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/761d2e6545a31d2ebf9cb60443ed2a9c2f8268b5/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.TargetFramework.Sdk/src/build/Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.TargetFramework.Sdk.props#L21-L22. Adding the `-windows` rid to every .NETFramework tfm results in this hack being applied in many more places and more NuGet.config files being necessary to disable VS's restore which can't handle restoring them: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/c94b75f662030a09c8747d79a16d9f4f2c9d44f1/src/libraries/System.Data.OleDb/NuGet.config#L2.

> Add some build checks that check P2Ps when building netfx libs, and ensuring that we are not incorrectly getting a NS2.0 asset when the P2P also has a net461-windows asset.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the [ProjectReference protocol](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/ProjectReference-Protocol.md) doesn't expose the necessary information to implement such a check. Of course you could always implement custom targets and MSBuild calls but that won't work with static graph build which we want to leverage."

 I understand that, perhaps, the likelihood to find a method that is still ""bad"" is extremely low for these helpers, but it is better to always perform full validation. One of the reasons is the fact that code is often copied for other helpers and between compiler layers.

"There's something a little bit backwards here - we are leveraging a bunch of the logic of signature help, which I'm pretty sure gives us the wrong `argumentCount` because it has to account for signature help for when a user is in the last position of a signature and you intend to add an argument; but because of that, we have to then re-adjust the argument count. So we're just hacking on the hack of signature help.

I would love to separate completions logic out from `SignatureHelp` more, but I'd rather not see the full refactor in this PR. It seems like the adjustment should actually happen in `signatureHelp.ts` - specifically in `getArgumentInfoForCompletions` (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/1fe9bfdd0ee0ecf9dff23a40c0066645719e46b9/src/services/signatureHelp.ts#L166)."

"> The buggy behavior occurred when there was no semantic classification or diagnostic request to trigger the flush of the old LS - instead, if we got an inlay hint request followed by an update, followed by another inlay hint request, the second inlay hint request would _not_ cause an LS synchronization to occur, and would instead reuse the LS from the first request verbatim.

There's something I still don't totally understand. Given the scenario where the editor

1. requests inlay hints
2. sends updates
3. requests inlay hints
4. requests errors

I understand that why the inlay hints might get skewed, but the entire text state for errors was off too - in a way that would imply the whole file was corrupted. So:

1. Why didn't `geterr` immediately force the old LS out?
2. What is it about a subsequent `updateOpen` (and maybe some other semantic operations) that enabled us to recover?

Every time I think that I understand what's going wrong, there's other architectural questions I have. For example, maybe it's not that the document itself is corrupted, it's just the line maps. I can understand that, but if it's just the line maps, why does that affect the checker's view of the file content (as opposed to the ranges on which it's reporting)? I can imagine that the line maps are used to construct the document for the LS, but then arguably the document text must be inaccurate in a way that's hard to recover from.

"You and I get very different numbers.  How exactly are you building System.Private.Xml.dll with these changes and then running the benchmarks? Regardless, I deterministically see the TryWrite version as being at least 10% faster than what's currently in main, not slower as your numbers suggest.  This is exactly the kind of scenario TryWriter is geared towards, enabling devs to write the simple thing and let the system generate the optimal set of calls under the covers.  So I want anything that should be using to use it rather than trying to work around any perceived current perf limitations by open-coding a replacement; then when TryWrite improves, so too does all the code using it... we improve the primitive implementations, and everyone benefits.  The code is also simpler, very clearly expressing the intent of what should be written.

If this were a super hot path, then yeah, it might be worth an exception to eek out a few more cycles of savings.  But we're talking about an API that's already a corner-case, used fairly rarely, a very small percentage of time, and then within that we're talking about a small percentage of that small percentage of possible improvement in open-coding the solution vs just doing the simple thing with TryWrite.  I would be very surprised if you were able to measure the impact of that difference on your 10-50GB workload; I'd welcome you trying it out and sharing the profiles that prove me wrong.

fgMorphModToSubMulDiv tries to check if it is ok to ""clone"" locals
instead of spilling them by checking for address exposure. This was
necessary because GTF_GLOB_REF is not up-to-date in preorder during
morph, which is when this runs. However, address exposure is not valid
for implicit byrefs at this point, so the check is not enough.

The logic is trying to figure out which of the operands need to be
spilled and which of them can be cloned. However, the logic was also
wrong in the face of potential embedded assignments. Thus, rework it to
check interference on its own.

As part of this, remove fgIsSafeToClone and make fgMakeMultiUse less
conservative by avoiding checking for address exposure. This was
probably an attempt at some limited interference checks, but other uses do
not seem to need this.

"This pattern of having a static `CreateDefaultDispatcher` plus an optional constructor param seems unusual to me, so I'd be interested to understand the goals.

"@github 

> Correct me if I'm wrong, but would the change be made here?:

Yes, the point where the layout for both editor and title widget starts is this:

https://github.com/SneakyFish5/vscode/blob/c1905a3d139ea803c8f46ffc6535e9abdfcb1b60/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/editor/editorGroupView.ts#L1702-L1702

As I already said, wouldn't this layout algorithm make more sense:
* editor group view layout gets called with the size it can consume
* editor title layout is called with that dimension and returns the actual width/height it consumes based on some rules
  * if multi line tabs are disabled, it just returns with `35px` (as today)
  * if multi-line tabs are enabled but the resulting editor size is below min width, it just returns with `35px` (see note below)
  * otherwise it returns with the exact height it consumed based on `offsetHeight`
* editor group uses the title height to pass on to the editor control
* layout is done

**Note:** maybe instead of the title control having hardcoded knowledge about the minimum size of the editor, it could rather accept the actual dimensions + the max dimensions it can consume. That way, the editor group view layout call can pass both the dimension and the max dimension into the title control. 

I suggest for now we ignore the other feedback I gave about `redraw` calling `relayout`, I think this needs additional thoughts how to get right. Let's first focus on the layout algorithm from editor group to editor title.

"> I modified deepFreeze to support an exclusion list. I then used this at the event location to exclude freezing the outputs.

Not a fan of that tbh - `deepFreeze` is ""deep"" and a flat list of key is always ambiguous in that context. Maybe my earlier suggestion was misleading. I like two things from this PR

1. improve `deepFreeze` to always ignore typed arrays because it is apparently illegal to freeze them. 
1. don't use `deepFreeze` when emitting the notebook change event. 

It is my bad that I started with `deepFreeze` here but I came to believe it is wrong to freeze objects that you ""don't own"", e.g the [function](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/1799e12d7ba8d94a5fa661d2ea2f2d6968e0b7a9/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostNotebookDocuments.ts#L31) that applies the change and emits the event should only shallow freeze the parts of the event it owns, like the event itself, `cellChanges`, `contentChanges` etc but not the notebook document or its cells.

"> @github are you critiquing my PR or the original behavior? My PR is about doing less reordering, not more.

It's possibly I'm just looking at it wrong, but my initial impression was that your PR was making things worse than they were before. If I output the character `א` followed the character `ב`, then I expect to see `א` in column 1 and `ב` in column 2. 

This is my test case:

    printf ""א""; sleep 1; printf ""ב""; printf ""\n""

And this is what that looks like in the preview build:

"> @github, @github, @github, I'm curious about the confused emoji you selected. Is that about the `!!` feature itself? About dotnet/runtime using it? About something else? Thanks for any feedback.

Hi! Yes, my reaction refers to the feature itself.
I have three concerns:
1. It seems to me that this reduces the readability of the code and increases the entry threshold. Instead of self-documenting attributes like [NotNull], we introduce additional language tokens, the purpose of which can only be understood from the documentation. It's like managed pointers `^`, it's like the first step towards getting closer to the C++ syntax, which has raised a lot of questions about the difference between `const char*` and `char const *`. `!!` matter - we must pay attention to them. But at the same time, these are only two characters - we will have to focus on each argument, looking for them. The difference from the `[ThrowIfNull]` attribute is only in length. So we slightly help those who will edit a method that uses NotNull arguments, but complicate life for those who use this method. 
2. It seems to me that instead of modifying the compiler, we delegate its task to the programmer. Thanks to non-nullable reference types, the compiler knows exactly which arguments can be null and which can't. If we don't want to validate arguments in the code, then let's not and let the compiler provide Fail Fast! for us.
3. I think this is a step in the wrong direction. Besides to checking for null, we have other checks for: empty string, empty collection, undefined Enum element, out of range, null element in collection, etc. All these checks will remain in the body of method. As a result, the probability of error will increase, since now both the one who edits the method and the one who uses it need to look for checks in two places. And the solutions for the cases described above cannot be written so simply as `!!` It seems to me that it would be more correct to concentrate on the ability to generate code based on attributes and increase the flexibility of the attributes, which would allow us to get AoP for all cases.

"There might be a bug in something somewhere that causes some issues in some scenarios. Sometimes some builds couldn't load a task or loaded the wrong one. This seemed to fix it 😆

"> but my question is why? 

Because i would really prefer to not have code that does stuff that is not necessary.  *Especially* at this layer.  I've tried to make it very precise and work very correctly with the documented sqlite API.  When we do things taht are unnecessary, it just makes things more confusing IMO because either it will convey the wrong thing to the reader (i.e. that the transaction is necessary), or it will have comments on it saying things like ""we don't actually need this, but we're doing it"", and eventually we'll be at a point where people will say ""i don't want to even touch this because i'm nt sure if it will be a problem""

>  is there an issue having transaction outside covering everything? 

Let me ask you this question:  do you place a `lock (something)` around all assignments in code?  Or do you just use that (and other synchronizations mechanisms) when appropriate because you actually have shared date and/or races to contend with?  

>  transaction seems too fragile and easy to get wrong.

I personally disagree.  I think it's vital that people not just ""throw transactions"" at the problem, in the same way i dont' think multithreading problems are solved just by adding locks.  Sqlite is *extremely* clear on the guarantees it provides (or not), and i've used transactions *judiciously* in the two places where they are needed for correctness.  "

"> I feel like this is an argument to avoid using built-in members entirely in nullable tests and that is a fairly onerous ask.

The majority of tests in this class use the `CreateNullableCompilation` helper to run analysis. That uses either the `netstandard2.0` or the `net451` reference assemblies hence all of the built-in members are oblivious. If the intent is to test oblivious then that works. My suspicion is though that in most cases the intent is not to test oblivious. Perhaps I'm wrong here though. 

> A more reasonable ask would be perhaps to verify what are the annotations on ref assemblies that are used in our nullable tests in practice

The answer to this depends on the test. If the test uses the `netstandard2.0` reference assemblies then there is one answer, if it uses `netcoreapp3.1` then there is a different answer. Basically it is subject to some degree of change. Generally that the API will get stronger though which is a ""safe"" change from this perspective. 

Consider this specific case though: the test here is using the `netstandard2.0` reference assemblies which means this is validating that `string~` can assign here. Was that the intent? Reading the test I thought the intent was to check what happened when either `string?` or `string!` was the source of the assignment. Am I just reading the intent of this test wrong (or reading the setup code wrong)?

> I'm a little resistant to the idea that we need to account for it here because it is going to need to be accounted for en masse.

I'm not suggesting we go back and rewrite all the tests. At the same time seems like something we could avoid going forward with new ones. 

> A more reasonable ask would be perhaps to verify what are the annotations on ref assemblies that are used in our nullable tests in practice, and ensure that the annotations on ref assemblies for tests do not change accidentally

The model we try to operate on is that we keep pushing the `.NET Core App` reference assemblies forward. Observe that while we have `netcoreapp3.1` assemblies we don't have `netcoreapp3.0` or `netcoreapp2.1`. That's because we're always effectively on latest. The API sets which are stable are `netstandard2.0`, `net451`, etc ...

"> But is it best to assume that there is no availability on those platforms? 

No. Lack of availability attributes means it's been available since our earliest supported versions.
E.g. lack of `[NoWatch]` implies it's `[Watch (2,0)]` and that the API has been available in the past 6 years (or so)

This is almost always wrong when adding bindings for a new Xcode (unless it added a new platform).

> Since it's a breaking change to remove things, and it's always easier to introduce things later on?

True :-) However it's true for code that we ship (post generation), not the binding sources!

Example:  `[NoWatch]` -> means we're not generating the API on watchOS.

If you don't _add_ `[NoWatch]` (in binding sources) then the API will be present inside `Xamarin.WatchOS.dll` (and assumed to be available since 2.0 which is watchOS minimum supported version).

If you want to fix that later, by adding `[NoWatch]`, then you are creating a **breaking change** (since the API won't be part of `Xamarin.WatchOS.dll` in the next release).

"Hey Jared, see the above convo with Matt/Tomas.  My personal main objection over having this be `object` is that it gets _super_ easy to accidentally use the wrong value as the compiler/language gives you zero type safety.  For example, there is code that looks like this in this pr:  `base(..., id: reference.Id)`.  If the 'id' were typed as `object`, it would have been trivial to accidently mistype that as:  `base(..., id: reference)` instead.  In that case the compiler would have given me no information that i did anything wrong.  However, because it is typed as MetadataId, i must provide an actual value typed that way.

Similarly, in the code that consumes this later, i have a `ConditionalWeakTable<MetadataId, ...>`.  In this form the compiler ensures that i'm looking up/storing with actual MetadataIds.  If it were typed as object it would have been trivial to accidently write `map.GetOrAdd(ref.GetMetadata(), ...)` instead of `map.GetOrAdd(ref.GetMetadata().Id, ...)`.

So, in other words, even though it is an empty type, it still provides real type safety in the code.  Something i would like to keep around.  

So personally, i would like it to be typed.  It reduces the chance of errors.  And, if we want to add state to it (perhaps for debugging purposes), now it is trivial to do so.

"@github Was there an issue discussing this feature that I'm not seeing?

Personally, I'm not sure that I like the idea of changing the claim processor at this point to have knowledge of some particular JSON-ims, and there are degenerate cases where things can go wrong.  Consider, for the sake of discussion, an identity provider that has two distinct claim values, `[""a""]` and `a`.

```C#
// Does anyone know why Fabrikam Identity uses such bad role names?
bool isAuditor = id.HasClaim(""[\""a\""]"");
bool isAdministrator = id.HasClaim(""a"");
```

In this degenerate case, an identity with the claim of `[\""a\""]` is now automatically both an auditor (String.Equals) and an administrator (String.Equals on the processed first array element).   This would break the security model, resulting in an elevation of privilege.

Adding special ""some identities use JSON arrays"" support now invites that other formats would be added later (and that no format can ever be taken away).  Combined with the fact that this type lives in the shared runtime, it means that any library using claims and using .NET Standard 2.0 couldn't really reason about whether their HasClaim is going to work or not.  (They'd have to target specific versions of .NET to indicate the minimum runtime behaviors they want for the same API).

---

All in all, I think that a better answer would be to make a new type (which extends ClaimsIdentity to override HasClaim) so that there's explicit opt-in (at some level) to this behavior.  It probably wants to be in a different library than System.Security.Claims, so that it doesn't leave a perpetual dependency on JSON.  And I'm not really sure that it even belongs in dotnet/runtime (it seems to mesh more with the JWT stuff, which is in a different repository... but maybe there's room for a new System.Security.Claims.Json package built out of dotnet/runtime)."
"> It will always be NULL the way it is being used.

...

> Hmm, not sure if this works for PSS / OAEP.

Yeah, it's really these two together that are why I made the local_ as complex as the real thing.

The local_ only checks for EVP_PKEY_RSA because it uses `base_id`, which turns `EVP_PKEY_RSA_PSS` into `EVP_PKEY_RSA`.  I think the purpose of the sidecar routine here was ""ugh, we have two different IDs for ""RSA"" and we keep getting the ""or"" wrong, so let's put them in one place"".  At least... that's the only reason I can figure out that they added it.

Yeah, in the generate flow the pkey is always NULL (which makes me wonder why they routed EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_keygen_bits through it at all).

1.0.2: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/12ad22dd16ffe47f8cde3cddb84a160e8cdb3e30/crypto/rsa/rsa.h#L256-L258

```C
# define EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_keygen_bits(ctx, bits) \
        EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl(ctx, EVP_PKEY_RSA, EVP_PKEY_OP_KEYGEN, \
                                EVP_PKEY_CTRL_RSA_KEYGEN_BITS, bits, NULL)
```

1.1.1: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/081a7061f3da07318c4b0f5de67b82285630bf6b/include/openssl/rsa.h#L121-L123

```C
# define EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_keygen_bits(ctx, bits) \
        RSA_pkey_ctx_ctrl(ctx, EVP_PKEY_OP_KEYGEN, \
                          EVP_PKEY_CTRL_RSA_KEYGEN_BITS, bits, NULL)
```

Looks like in 3.0 it's a function in its own right, but I believe the EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl route (with or without going through RSA_pkey_ctx_ctrl) will still work.

"I haven't read through the comments here yet, but just taking a look as someone who spends a fair amount of time in the csproj files...

At a high-level, the change seems ok.  Some csprojs will get an extra few lines they don't already have, and conditions like `Condition="" '$(TargetsOSX)' == 'true'""` change to conditions like `Condition="" '$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'OSX'""`.  Ok.

I'm more concerned that some such conditions are more confusing and much more likely to lead to user error that's hard for us to understand and debug, and we'll end up with devs spinning their wheels trying to figure out what's gone wrong.  For example, one line changes this very obvious statement:
`<ItemGroup Condition="" '$(TargetsUnix)' == 'true'"">`
which is pretty obvious in meaning, to:
`<ItemGroup Condition=""'$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' != '' and '$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' != 'windows'"">`
which, at least to me, is not at all obvious.  I fully expect folks will get that conversion wrong.  And there's obviously a subtly I don't understand, because elsewhere this:
`Condition=""'$(TargetsUnix)' == 'true' or '$(TargetsBrowser)' == 'true'""`
is replaced by this:
`Condition=""'$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'Unix' or '$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'Browser'""`
Why is Unix usable in one TargetsUnix case and not the other?  Why are we checking for empty identifiers?  Etc.  To make this usable, that will need to be simplified.

Changes like this one are also harder to understand (at least for me) without digging in further to what's going on:
Before: `<ItemGroup Condition=""'$(TargetFrameworkIdentifier)' == '.NETFramework' or '$(TargetsWindows)' == 'true'"">`
After: `<ItemGroup Condition=""'$(GeneratePlatformNotSupportedAssemblyMessage)' == ''"">`

Separately, I'm not clear on changes like this one, which is removing a netstandard2.1 build apparently?

The motivation called out at the very beginning of the PR states:
""This change makes it possible to migrate 200+ (ref+src) projects to use
TargetFramework instead of TargetFrameworks which avoids the additional
outer build evaluation and invocation which ultimately makes the overall
build faster.""
but that change doesn't appear to be in this PR.  If we're going to change everything over and make everyone on the team learn new more complicated conditions, it should come with a benefit... that benefit would seem to require changing those projects over to use TargetFramework, so it'd be nice if that were included in this PR.  A separate commit is fine."
"This is awesome.

Since we're going through like two calls and then checking _some_ overload is maybe OK (rather than doing overload resolution), and _not_ validating any argument types beyond the first (that's what #29818 does), choosing to only issue an error when we're absolutely sure something's wrong seems reasonable."
"In a sense, this is not wrong—`gen` could have its `next()` called with no arguments, making `a` `undefined` at runtime. But previously, this fell into a special case of ignoring that optionality for convenience.

Now, when we try to get the iteration types of `Generator<R, T, S> | AsyncGenerator<R, T, S>` as an async _iterable_, we get `noIterationTypes`, because the former doesn’t have a `[Symbol.asyncIterator]()` member. Instead, we fall back to getting the iteration types of this union as an async _iterator_, using its next/return/throw method signatures to determine `T`, `TReturn`, and `TNext`. Because we have a union signature, it doesn’t count as a reference to one of the global generator/iterator types, and so it doesn’t take the fast path that ignores the optionality. Instead, it correctly sees that the `next()` method can take no arguments or `[1]`, and so it infers the type `1 | undefined`.

More work could be done to make union signatures take the fast path that drops the optionality if every signature in the union is a reference to one of the global generator/iterator types, but I felt like this was getting fairly complex for limited utility—the results it produces with less complexity are strictly more correct given the limitations we have for modeling this."
"So for example:
`v >= int.MinValue ` generates a tree that is equal to `return (v < int.MinValue) == false`

`v <= ulong.MaxValue` generates a tree that is equal to `return (v > -1) == false
`ulong.MaxValue >= v` generates a tree that is equal to `return (-1 < v) == false
These trees look odd to me because (v > -1) is going to be always true.

So for the single element versions of `vst1` and `vld1` intrinsics we never generate `ST1` and `LD1` on little-endian. There we always generate `str` and `ldr` since they provide more addressing modes.

#include <arm_neon.h>

void foo (int32x4_t v, int32_t *a)

will generate a `str     q0, [x0]`

I have not seen much done to make Maui trimming safe by construction. https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/355 that tracks the work does not have a lot of traffic. For .NET 6, I assume that Maui will be on trim and hope for the best plan that Xamarin apps have been on historically.

Correct me if my conjecture is wrong and we have plan in place to make maui trimming safe by construction for .NET 6.

We have done good work on making core libraries annotated for trimming in .NET 6. We have run out of time to address the trimming issues in the app models where I think M.E.DependencyInjection injection belongs. Another issue in the same bucket are issues with integration of source generated json serializers in ASP.NET that prevent ASP.NET webservices from being provably trimming safe by default. It will be something to focus on .NET 7. I expect that it will need work from multiple teams to address successfully (appmodel teams, runtime teams, language).

"> I wonder, if the condition for having an empty span is so specific, why the failure is not easily reproducible? And how does `memLevel` affect that?

The memory level for the deflater represents how much memory it is allowed to use internally before flushing to `output` buffer. Larger memory, better performance and better compression ratios - the classic trade-off between speed and memory. The default is 8, which in turn means that the deflater is allowed to allocate up to 2^8 KB of memory.

So for example, if we try to deflate 10_000 bytes of data in a single deflate call, it deflater in most cases will not produce any output unless we explicitly say we want it to. In our case it is essential to avoid flushing and only flush when we're done deflating.

However there might be cases when the deflater has reached some limit in its internal buffer and will flush bytes. It might even flush as many bytes as we've given it opportunity to. My original assumption was that the deflater will always return `ErrorCode.BufError` when the provided buffer is full and internally there is more outstanding data, but because we're not explicitly specifying that we're flushing, I guess my assumption is wrong.

This is why working with `memLevel` 1 = 2KB internal memory is easier to reproduce the error - I can craft messages, more easily, that would exhaust its internal memory and cause it to flush.

I hope this makes sense, let me know if I can help further.

"Last commit fixed a subtle bug.

When we devirtualize a tail call we might fail to recognize that the tail call is now a recursive tail call, because we are checking the wrong method handle. For normal methods this just means we may not mark the block range as a loop (which is bad but rarely leads to bugs). But for OSR methods this is fatal because they need to use this to trigger importation of the method entry.

One method where this happens is `System.Xml.Serialization.StructMapping:System.Xml.Serialization.INameScope.get_Item(System.String,System.String):System.Object:this` from the xml serialization libraries tests (under random OSR stress, we put a patchpoint at offset 0x1b).

Are we worried we can overflow `int`? I can bump count to `long` or `ulong`. This is no longer ""the answer"" but more so the upper guess. The actual answer comes from walking the structures and counting entries we like. "
"@github I'm pretty sure the fix here is to just change the call to this

```C#
bool PageIsInThisContext(IView page)
{
	var platformView = page.ToPlatform();
```

It's passing the wrong `MauiContext` into `ToPlatform` there which causes the `Page` to recreate the handler. That page already has a handler so `ToPlatform` will just return it if you don't pass in a `MauiContext`

I'm not too sure why this broke in `p14`. The `MauiContext` has been passed into the code since we created `AlertManager`. I'm guessing the work we did to rewrite these extensions made it so two wrongs no longer were making a right"
"Wait wait wait... This PR looks wrong. I never committed to 2.1 (only 2.2). This PR seems to have picked up a few commits from 2.2.

Btw I think the instructions for updating this pull request need to be fixed. I think the last line should be a force push."
"If this is being done here, are there also updates to the `EnsureInitialized` method above? Seems wrong that it also calls `Interop.GetBaseUri`.

Overall, the initialization flow starts to seem a bit complicated as there's more than one code path that calls these initialization methods. If there any way to consolidate this that would be good.

For example, it's not clear to me why the `InitializeNavigationManager` method now exists in `WebAssemblyHostBuilder`. Since the only thing it does is use synchronous interop to fetch its config from the JS side, would it work more simply to have a regular constructor on `WebAssemblyNavigationManager` that takes a `WebAssemblyJSRuntimeInvoker` and provides its own initialization logic? If so, the `EnsureInitialized` override could be removed, and we wouldn't need this `InitializeWithParameters` method. The whole flow would then be much more understandable.

I haven't really thought through all the details so maybe there are reasons it has to work like it does, but just want to check."
"Just a thought, which I don't mind whether you do anything with or not :) Instead of having multiple checks for `isWebAssembly` that run each time there are calls, an alternative would be changing the static constructor so that the static `_renderers` dictionary doesn't even get instantiated in non-wasm cases.

Then there would be no need to check `isWebAssembly` in each of these methods - they would just nullref if they were called on the wrong platform (and they never should be called like this - it could only happen if we introduced a bug since it's `internal` anyway - so a nullref is a reasonable level of error handling).

Additionally, if we add more methods that access `_renderers` in the future, we wouldn't have to remember to add an `isWebAssembly` check."
Oh I thought that was only for flaky tests. Not for surely failing tests due to path issues. But I could be wrong. @github?
"I might be wrong here, but if we were to support multi-threading we would still be single threaded on the UI, since changing that would be a massive breaking change of epic proportions. We would likely switch to use a synchronization context in the same way we do on the server."
This is problematic. For normal file-based assembly `C:\temp\MyApp.dll` the `assemblyDirectory` will end up `C:\temp`. But for single-file in `C:\temp\MyApp.exe` the `assemblyDirectory` will end up as `C:\` - very likely wrong.
"Yes; I had a source generator for the IHeaderDictionary (how I originally generated them); but the CI rejected it as a used project that wasn't in the shipped API, which seemed to be going wrong since it was just internal and not to be shipped.

Could automate it as part of the Kestrel code generator (so only need to add to HeaderNames); however that would need an attribute on some of the headers (e.g. `DNT`) to say don't add them (Obselete may work or may be too strong; since it also has `Path`,`Scheme`, `Method` etc.)"
This feels like the wrong place to do the normalization (assuming it is needed)?

This feedback is about this particular change.

A simple refactoring here makes the code clearer and less difficult to get wrong.  Thanks!

Yes.  That's the point :)  Now the language and compiler force you to think about that side of things.  That's a good thing :)  It means that if someone comes in and adds/changes any flow control, they're forced to consider the telemetry implications.

">  Anyway, I think I need to check my solution because I noticed one issue. Spacing is calculated correctly but items on the edges have incorrect size. For example, items in first and last columns of vertical grid with 3 and more than spans will have different width than ones in inner columns

@github @github I think I see why this is happening - the `GetItemOffsets` method is using `GetChildAdapterPosition(view)` to determine an index for the item. But the index also depends on whether there are header/footer items, so with a header in place the index is off by one and the offsets for the items on the edges are calculated wrong.

I think I see how we can fix this; the SpacingItemDecoration will need to have the SpanSizeLookup item passed in from the ItemsViewRenderer; the SpanSizeLookup. I'll implement that in the morning and see if we can fix this issue. "

"The way I understand the AIDL dokumentation is that multidimensional arrays like `int[][]` are not supported. At the moment the `CSharpCodeGenerator` or maybe the `AidlParser` just ignores higher dimensions and int[][] is treated like int[]. However throwing some NotSupportedException might not be wrong.

For `List` I think - but not 100% sure - you can put any supported object in. And one object can be a List which can contain other Lists and so on. I don't know why (maybe a bug) but the Android Studio does not support parametrization like `List<List<List<String>>>>`, just `List<String>`. So you can use `List` and put Lists in but `List<List>>` does not work!?

The CSharpCodeGenerator might not cover all cases for Lists correct and should definetely be unit tested also in this perspect."
"I just tested and I was wrong earlier, we do have scenarios already where we restore activities that are stopped:
````C#
        public static void Main(string[] args)

            Activity a = new Activity(""root"");
            a.Start();

            Activity b = new Activity(""child"");
            b.Start();

"Because it was wrong :)

It turns out we only ever hit AddHeaders code path for two things:
1) Adding in the DefaultRequestHeaders
2) Forwarding headers for a decompressed response in SocketsHttpHandler

For (2), the headers are all raw response headers, so in AddHeaders above, the `if (sourceValue is HeaderStoreItemInfo info)` check will always be false and we'll never hit this AddHeaderInfo path.

For (1), the headers are all forced to be in HeaderStoreItemInfo instances (something else to revisit), and we were only getting here after calling ParseRawHeaderValues, which for a custom header with no validation would basically transfer the raw value to the parsed field.

But I removed that ParseRawHeaderValues call, so now we may still have raw values here."

I think now `newLine` doesnt have to be on `fsHost` with this change. 
`useCaseSensitiveFileNames` should be on `fsHost` as its related to file system

"Looking through the change, this looks like an extremely disruptive change. There will be many individual scripts (outside the repo) that need to be adjusted. It also seems to turn RID concepts into user-visible concepts, possibly unnecessarily. I always disliked the usage of ""Windows_NT"" (IMO, it should be ""Windows"" - we stopped saying ""NT"" like 20 years ago), and ""OSX"" should be ""macOS"". But using ""win"" everywhere that an OS name is required seems like overkill. Especially since ""win"" is an English word as well as a magic RID abbreviation meaning the Windows OS. Using ""win"" instead of ""Windows"" in non-RID contexts seems wrong. Is this whole change worth the trouble (and inevitable long tail fallout)?"

I've played a little bit with it and it seems to work pretty well - I only have one caveat with it: it doesn't support `/** @github jsx */` as it's not a member expression. Or at least I couldn't figure out how to make it work. As the whole thing only seems to work with namespaces anyway as you can't really put types onto runtime values - would it be possible to extend the support for it in a way that if a particular simple binding that is used as a pragma is imported from a module then this would check if the module itself exports `JSX`? I might be wrong - but the change seems quite logical and shouldn't be that hard to implement, given the fact that the whole notion of localized `JSX` is already implemented. I could even try to implement support for this myself. Would that be something that TS team could endorse?

EDIT:// I've tracked down [the PR adding support for this](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/22207) and it seems that what I'm after can actually be done by defining a factory function and a namespace with the same name.

Backport of #46151 to release/5.0

Fixes: #45651

## Customer Impact

On Unix, when using blocking overloads of `Socket.ReceiveFrom` after an asynchronous call to the same socket, the call may return wrong `remoteEP`. Users of the `Socket` type working with UDP may hit this.

## Regression?

Yes. The behavior is correct on 3.1.

## Testing

In the original PR I extended `SocketTestHelper` so our existing `SendToRecvFrom_Datagram_UDP` tests can validate the sync-over-async path of the blocking `ReceiveFrom`. Unfortunately, those tests are disabled on the 5.0 branch, so I had to port a minimal subset of #44591 (the fix enabling the tests) so we can run them on CI for 5.0.

## Risk

Low. The bug was a small overlook, the product code change is minimal, and impacts only the affected sync-over-async `ReceiveFrom` path.

"> I'm confused why you would categorize this ICorProfiler implementation as ""careless"", is -1 considered a valid value that means gen2 for profilers?

No. -1 is not considered as a valid value to mean gen2. Perhaps ""less defensive"" is a better description than ""careless"" in this case. One could imagine a less defensive implementation look like this.

```c++
int gen = GetObjectGeneration(...);
counter[gen]++;
```

or a more defensive one look like this:

```c++
int gen = GetObjectGeneration(...);
if (0 <= gen && gen <= 4)
{
  counter[gen]++;
}
else
{
  assert(false);
}
```

In the former case, we will have a buffer underflow issue, in the latter case, the statistics are wrong. Either case is not great, but the former one is worse."

As noted in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/60769#issuecomment-951114180, the assumption that the live-built runtime of version `(X+1).0` can be a drop-in replacement in an SDK of version `X.0` is sometimes wrong, and it currently breaks our stress tests.

This PR changes both local (non-containerized) and containerized stress builds to build against the live-built runtime with the help of [`targetingpacks.targets`](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/eng/targetingpacks.targets).

Some tricky parts:
- The docker builds no longer replace the shared dotnet runtime. Instead, we copy the live built runtime dll-s and ref dlls under `/live-runtime-artifacts` and reference that location from properties required by `targetingpacks.targets`
- We also copy testhost to `/live-runtime-artifacts`. Tests being executed by `TESTHOSTDIR/dotnet exec STRESSBINDIR/HttpStress.dll <args>` then.
- Since I wanted to avoid using the entire repository as the container context, `targetingpacks.targets` also goes to `/live-runtime-artifacts`
- HttpStress needs compatible (7.0) `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` bits. These are acquired by getting the latest daily SDK build with `dotnet-install.sh/ps1`
- This mechanism replaces the outdated `privateAspNetCore` stuff implemented in #33860
- To support local, non-containerized test execution helper scripts `build-local.ps1/sh` have been implemented. In case of HttpStress these scripts need to grab the daily SDK just like container scripts.
- Visual Studio experience is now broken for HttpStress, but it can be ""fixed"" by temporary local hacks if necessary

Fixes #60769.

<hr />

The Regex span support changed the scanning infrastructure to always be based on spans.  That means that when a string is passed in by the caller, internally we still operate on it as a span.  That also means we can take advantage of slicing, and if the caller has specified via a beginning/length set of arguments that we should only process a substring, we can just slice to that substring.  That, however, then means that all offsets computed by the scanning implementation are 0-based rather than beginning-based.  The span change included a fixup for the overall match position, but not for the position of each individual capture, and that then meant that captures were providing the wrong values.  We unfortunately didn't have any tests for validating groups that also involved non-0 beginnings with string inputs.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/66697

A new type was added in front of the marker, special types precede all well-known types. The marker, however, should maintain its value (255)

"> @github thanks. you seem to indicate there is a race condition even in todays code, can you clarify?

The previous code used to assign `userEnv` from the window configuration and `shellEnv` in two promises running in parallel. There was no guarantee at which order they would run. Not sure if the existing code still suffers from this issue, I'm not sure where `userEnv` is assigned to `process.env` now.

> Unfortunately the assignment to process.env has to stay in preload.js because once we enable sandbox and contextIsolation you cannot change process.env outside of preload.js.

And this introduces a problem, for us to know if we should assign it, we need the `configuration.userEnv`, but that is only available later and is not supplied to that promise so it can make the decision. The promise that gets the configuration and the shell environment ones run in parallel. How should this be tackled? (P.S. If there is an acceptable way to pass it in, or do the check before it, we can also avoid sending the message to get the shell env at all if not needed)

Just reiterating so we are on the same page, the problem that this tries to fix is that VS Code is trying to check the wrong environment for `VSCODE_CLI` and `VSCODE_FORCE_USER_ENV`. It checks the parent process environment, rather than the environment of the new window, which makes it make the wrong decision based on the environment of the first opened window."

@github Given the recent Azure Pipeline [macOS build failure](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=2732325&view=logs&s=1afc3bfe-122c-538b-e9ad-2a86c2efcfef&j=9fac13c5-5013-5cc9-5c17-da47b3873a81) perhaps we should just print the full `outputPath` here in case we're somehow putting these files in the wrong place?
I was actually wrong here. Changes are applied to the data source on a background thread. This was allowing the background thread to run and force the update.
"I think projects tend to reuse shorthands. And certainly w/in a commit or series.

I'm also open to ideas for how to write rules for extra exclusions. e.g. Ignore strings shorter than x characters, or longer than y characters.

fwiw, there are 71 two-character (676 possible, 612 not in a dictionary*) and 399 three-character (17576 possible, 16991 not in a dictionary) tokens in the whitelist:

```
$ perl -pne 's/././g' .github/actions/spell-check/whitelist/*.txt|sort |uniq -c|sort -n|grep -A100 39
  39 ................
  47 ...............
  48 ..............
  71 ..
  93 .............
 105 ............
 150 ...........
 182 ..........
 240 .........
 309 ........
 311 ....
 324 .....
 348 .......
 356 ......
 399 ...
```
-- collectively, much more of the whitelist is 4+5+6 character sequences

Most of the annoying sequences I run into are hashes / base64 encodings (e.g. PKI or data: or git shas). My general response to those is to just ignore the file entirely -- the most common types are either .key/.pem/.crt or things like package.json/package-lock.json.

One thing you should do is review the whitelist, in reviewing it just now, I realized that there were a couple of misspellings in it... which I'm addressing by fixing & removing.

One example is `defing` which could easily be written out as `defining` if one wanted to force the word (the context is `#define` / `#undef`).

There's also the odd case of `TfEditses.cpp` -- that resulted in `Editses` being in the whitelist, but the thing is `EditSession` and it probably should be `TfEditSes.cpp`. -- Addressing that would be a distinct PR as it's a significant code change (renaming a file) and I'd definitely want pre-approval before considering it.

Note that you'll probably see things like `egistry` in the whitelist, since `\r` and `\t` are often used as escape characters, my code makes some assumptions at the expense of forcing people to whitelist some things which aren't actually misspelled in context. -- Windows unfortunately (for my code) tends to use `\` as a path delimiter which means that when my code looks at the string it's making the wrong guess and lopping off that `r` or `t`.

Anyway, please feel free to try it for a bit. I'm definitely eager to improve the experience."

I'm trying to look through MUX changes to see if there's something that stands out. [microsoft-ui-xaml#2377](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/pull/2377) looks related, but I can't easily bisect on our side to see if that's it...

it's definitely the `AccentButtonStyle`. If you add the following to the ""OkButton"" in the color picker dialog:

"> static_map serves as a landing zone for us to go and switch to `constexpr` once we can build with `/std:c++20` and get constexpr sort. It might come at cost until then. In fairness, I asked Chester to use it here by way of kicking the tires.

Ah OK. I thought maybe it was something about the parameter types that were preventing the constexpr sort from working. I forgot it needed c++20. But even if the map construction were happening at build time, that's just improving the startup time - I wouldn't think it would make the lookup itself any faster. Anyway, it's not a big deal. I was just curious about the choice, and I could be wrong about the speed advantages of the map anyway."

hm, how measuring is different from what u check and for what u raise errors described in the thread? Since reporting “correct” errors would require full structural computation - shouldnt this be described here as a limitation for raising those errors? I mean - sometimes they just wont be raised and u will trust the user input, did i get this right?"

"> This effectively works via a blocklist approach, where a particular call site is blocklisted. Blocklisted call sites incur significantly more overhead. But that can significantly negatively impact a call site that’s shared infrastructure and just happens to be used in one place that’s blocking. For example, in ASP.NET MVC I assume there’s an async method somewhere that has the job of invoking controller actions; if just one synchronous controller action somewhere in the system ends up just once blocking on something via a Task, doesn’t that end up tainting every other controller operation in the whole system?

See (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47366#issuecomment-766288490). If the identification of the workitem is too coarse grained then it can be problematic. I see that as a problem but maybe one we can come up with creative solutions to (or maybe we need to opt out in those cases)

> If anything in the system ever blocks on a task just once on a thread pool thread (which I expect is super likely in a real app), every subsequent thread pool operation incurs the cost of multiple static field accesses plus a HashSet lookup. That is non trivial overhead.

This is problematic and concerns me as well. Ben and I spoke about this a little but haven't come up with anything as yet. I have some crazy ideas that would require @github approval 😄.

> It seems like this could actually introduce deadlocks where they wouldn’t otherwise happen. The code is forcing all work items associated with the blocklisted call sites into a single queue, and then relying on a subset of threads to process that queue. That subset is limited, much more so than the number of threads possible in the pool. If all of those threads end up getting blocked on something that requires that queue to be processed, it’ll deadlock, and as far as I can tell, neither the hill climbing nor the starvation prevention mechanisms will kick in to help, because they’re unaware of the this blocked queue (if additional threads were added for other reasons, than one might help out here, but it wouldn’t be provoked to by this).

Temporary deadlocks because the thread pool would grow anyways? This commit, requests a new thread https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47366/commits/f5702e8616a32febe839fcab7dc307cca67dafe6 which should signal to the thread pool that work that more threads are needed.

> This increased the size of every work item by a reference, which in most cases is a 25% increase. If you instead change it to have a virtual call to avoid the extra field, it’s an extra virtual dispatch on every work item. If you instead change it to try to consolidate to a single field, it’s an extra cast on every work item (or non-trivial additional unsafe casting).

I feel like if you can solve the hashset problem, you can potentially solve this as well. We need a fast way to identify if a workitem is potentially blocking. Are there any free bits in the object header 😄? 

> This adds significant complexity, duplicates key processing loops, incorporates somewhat arbitrary thresholds, and effectively adds a side pool. 

Right but it aims at dramatically improving a problem that our customers have that isn't going away. Lots of code we have like this has these types of arbitrary thresholds (sometimes without knobs...)

> It would require serious testing on a myriad of workloads to feel confident that this is the right approach and right set of tradeoffs.

"> What would be the size regression for R2R if it is enabled? It does not sound right to pessimize R2R like this. Note that some important 1st party teams are running R2R code without tiered compilation. If the size regression is non-acceptable, maybe this should be configurable?

Yes, it's configurable, customers can re-AOT CoreLib by using `DOTNET_JitExtendedDefaultPolicyPrejit=1` to use the new one.

Currently it adds around +1 Mb: 9.8Mb -> 10.8Mb (+10%) and depends on:
1) Max IL size (512 bytes of IL, 100 in the DefaultPolicy)
2) Max BB count (unlimited, used to be 5 in the )
3) We currently apply quite some big multiplier for methods with profile (in case if there are also other profitable observations).

So that +1Mb doesn't bring much value for customers who use Tiered JIT. However, @github, correct me if I'm wrong, but when the default inliner prejits code it also asks VM to save ""noinline"" for failed attempts, not only in the PrejitRoot mode (as I hoped) so it limits opportunities for the new one during re-jitting by disallowing it to inspect methods larger than 100 bytes of IL or >5 of BBs. 

I've just launched a couple of TE benchmarks to check ExtendedDefaultPolicy for R2R + TieredCompilation=0.

"> I'm assuming you meant `chars.Length == 24`

Yep, typed wrong in the first comment.

> Can't do this because a 17 and 18 byte string will also be 24 bytes when encoded.

Maybe I missunderstand something now, but the string is encoded and we try to decode it, then check if the decoded data (byte) is of size 16. 
So the other way round this means, 16 data bytes -> 24 base64 encoded utf8-bytes.
And for base64 the encoded length is always a multiple of 4.

Thus if `chars.Length != 24` we know that the decoded data won't be 16 bytes, so we can short-circuit the method and return `false`. No need to try to decode the input.

If `chars.Length == 24` we can try to decode, then check if `written == 16`.

Ahhhhh, now I see that in my previous comment it may look like the entire method. It's just a fragment. Sorry.

So I mean:
```c#
public static bool IsRequestKeyValid(string value)
{
    ReadOnlySpan<char> chars = value.AsSpan();

    if (chars.Length != 24)
    {
        return false;
    }

    Span<byte> temp = stackalloc byte[16];
    var success = Convert.TryFromBase64Chars(chars, temp, out int written);

    return written == 16 && success;
}
```

If you want I could submit a PR for the vectorized version (next week)."
"I suspect this problem relates to dotnet/arcade#4155 though it looks worse in this repo (which doesn't use System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource).

I also suspect an issue with `CoherentParentDependency` attributes because the ""Coherency Updates"" described above should be tied to EntityFrameworkCore dependencies. Those updates occurred _before_ anything from EntityFrameworkCore came in (see initial 396a4749372cdff207a1a17b16d7491ceba45633 commit). The only 'CoherentParentDependency` attributes in eng/Version.Details.xml tie things to Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.win-x64, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -- nothing from aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling.

More specifically, I now suspect the following is messing things up:
``` xml
<Dependency Name=""Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces"" Version=""1.0.0"" CoherentParentDependency=""Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.win-x64"">                                                                                                                <Uri>https://github.com/dotnet/corefx</Uri>                                                                             <Sha>4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea</Sha>                                                                   </Dependency>

@github shouldn't that dependency be pinned instead of made coherent with core-setup?

> Or subscription here is wrong???

FYI we do not subscribe directly to CoreFx or core-setup dependencies in this repo or AspNetCore-Tooling.

"Re problems making the repo build:
Installing nodejs  + yarn + JDK - not a great experience based on the docs. On Windows I was able to do all of this via winget eventually (after lot of searching) and probably a lot faster then following the various websites. On Linux it feels even worse - ended up searching how to do it via apt-get mostly.
But I must admit I never worked with nodejs and so on, so maybe this is just me doing it for the first time.

Lastly - I was trying this on Windows and Linux WSL. The WSL seems to cause issues for the Selenium based tests - I think I installed everything per the doc (but I could be wrong) and the Selenium tests were still failing for me.

I guess there's a bit of a weird dichotomy to the document - it starts explaining git in relative detail. But then the section on installing pre-reqs is often very short - especially nodejs which is basically just a link. I like that at least on Windows Java can be installed by a script - that helps a lot. Would be nice to have the same for Linux.

Very last minor nit: I use PowerShell even on Linux, but the PS scripts in the repo fail in weird ways when used on Linux (didn't investigate why). For example the `activate.ps1` misbehaves - and the shell script is not a replacement since it won't do me any good when in PS.

* Emojis are now rendered with proper alpha blending -- no black edges anymore, and the selected foreground color won't affect emojis anymore either (however the solution for this is rather hacky, because the DirectWrite API is absolutely unwilling to just give me the information I need grrr)
* Font axes/features
* (First half of gridlines)

This is wrong. I need to review the entire diff now...
"It looks like Apple's documentation is wrong.

`dispatch_get_main_queue` was available in Xcode 4.3, which is iOS 5.1, and according to the header back then it was introduced in iOS 4.0:

"Same here, the defensive .HasValue check would actually prevent us from detecting corrupt state since we're not throwing if it's wrong"
When certificate is provided upfront we need to do this only once and we re-se same connectionConfiguration for all incoming connection. It does not need to be here but if there is something wrong with provided option I feel it is better to throw sooner than later.
A lot of the code below is now incorrect.  All of the equality operators are going to do the wrong thing.
"This code cam from a sample provided by Xamarin. https://github.com/xamarin/monotouch-samples/blob/master/CustomInputStream/ZInputStream.cs

If I remember right you needed the scheduler for the custom implementation to work correctly. 

Looking at some other examples online. https://github.com/pavelosipov/POSInputStreamLibrary/blob/master/POSInputStreamLibrary/POSBlobInputStream.m

It appears we are missing a few run loop methods on NSStream that makes it difficult to sub class. https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSStream_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSStream

Can you double check I am not crazy and that `scheduleInRunLoop:forMode:` and `removeFromRunLoop:forMode:` don't exist on NSStream.

"In general we keep the same names as Apple, unless they are incorrect (wrong/typos) or very confusing. It's globally more consistent (e.g. newer API In future SDK will likely use the names, but the _binder_ might not know we changed them in older API).
"
"I assume this part corresponds to the PR description:
> I updated the code to simple return failure instead of throwing. (that will clean the connection)

Could you explain exactly what ""clean the connection"" means in this context? We have methods like Shutdown (finish using) and Close (free memory). Does it mean we don't need to call one/both of them? Won't it lead to double free since we're calling `connection.Dispose()` few lines above?

I'm just trying to understand what this exactly mean, I'm not saying it's wrong."

Assert.True's string needs to be what you're asserting, not what went wrong."
The comment is wrong - there is no `armel`.
"I don't mean changing the error behavior here. Instead I'm pointing out that the transpiled code is wrong. That's more obvious if you transpile to ES6

```ts
class C extends Object {
  prop = 1;

    something();
    super();
  }
}

// currently transpiles to something similar to this
class C extends Object {
  constructor() {

    return super() || this;

// instead it should be
class C extends Object {

"Would it be worth it to bail in a class expression / function expression? If you walk into a context that has a different `this`, I think the logic would be wrong. Also unclear whether it would be wrong in an arrow function expression in general, but probably would be right in an arrow function IIFE? 😬 At any rate, assigning functions that use `this` to a `this` property in JS code is a realistic test case, especially if we're talking about ES5-style constructor functions as opposed to classes."
"I’m not saying there’s anything wrong here, just observing that it was weird for someone to write this test this way in the first place, a long time ago. I think the changes you made to these make sense 👍 "
"The _actual_ surprising thing _is_ that nothing changed here. This code path handled union composite signatures... and now we're handling intersection composite signatures _in the same way_ (rather than inverting anything), which is _odd_.  The reason for that is explained in this comment (namely that for compat reasons we intentionally do ""the wrong thing"" for union signatures here, which happens to be ""the right thing"" for intersection signatures)"
"> This seems worrisome from a security standpoint. Can we consider at a minimum using a different ArrayPool than the shared one to mitigate the possibility that code elsewhere (mis-)using ArrayPool might end up leaking sensitive data?

This is one of many places `ArrayPool<byte>.Shared.Return` is used without clearing, especially since not clearing is the default:
https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/ArrayPool.cs,34fc80a1ec3f75d7,references
That includes other places in this class:
https://source.dot.net/#System.Net.Http/ArrayBuffer.cs,129
In other words, this particular call site was an anomaly.

If we want to revisit such clearing decisions, we can, but that should be a separate issue / PR.  This change is really just bringing this particular use into consistency.

Also, to my knowledge, most of pipelines and more generally Kestrel isn't clearing for its pooling, its slab memory blocks, etc.  @github can correct me if I'm wrong."

"> Correct me if I'm wrong, but the SQ2 is a Cortex-A76 based big.LITTLE core right?

Related to #49206.
When we call runtime_invoke on wasm the exception always returns NULL and the error returns OK.
This was a problem because we were trying to get value of this new static property in DateTime type:
private static ReadOnlySpan<byte> DaysInMonth365 => new byte[] { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };
As we don't know that we were getting an exception, the value that returns to the test was wrong.
The goal of this PR is detect that we got an exception when running runtime_invoke and return the expected value to debugger.
This is a temporary solution, I think the final solution is to fix runtime_invoke to return exception correctly on WASM.
We also need to support it: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/b3411852caa6a3de8ab9fa27f7860c76ef43e384/src/mono/mono/metadata/object.c#L6298

"> Can you say a bit more about the problems you had with converting ` Object.GetType` and why you ultimately decided you could live without it...perhaps in an issue you open to track converting it to new style?

I didn't give up, just wanted to do it iteratively for all of them eventually to keep the PRs easier to review.

The primary goal is the ability to recognize `typeof(T) cmp typeof(T)` in inliner (and `String.Length`), from my understanding - foldable `obj.GetType() == typeof()` patterns where obj's type is known/final are less common (but I might be wrong).

`Object.GetType` led to this assert: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/coreclr/jit/importer.cpp#L8185

`eeCallInfo` returned `CORINFO_VIRTUALCALL_STUB` for it instead. I suspect the problem is here: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/coreclr/tools/aot/ILCompiler.ReadyToRun/JitInterface/CorInfoImpl.ReadyToRun.cs#L1587-L1589 (and a similar code in the native crossgen1)

Both crossgens know nothing about the new style intrinsics, I tried to fix this specific case like this https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/52156/commits/65a9154a5d4a2d8518022c58535d8a5a0c169872 and looked like it helped but none-windows platforms still asserted so I decided to postpone it a bit 🙁 "

The unit tests for `MemoryExtensions.EnumerateRunes` were originally checked in via https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/33504, but this was later reverted via https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/b016a5661ec64e7304380afa44ad9667bd5519a8 since the checkin was to the wrong file. This PR reintroduces those unit tests (to the correct file!) since we otherwise don't have test coverage over these APIs.

This is a test-only change. There are no changes to shipping code.

@github By ""wrong"" I mean the fast path is not taken, and even creates some overhead in cases where object is actually a subclass. Example (Default mode, Main):
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/523221/126220210-ea8a811e-43d5-4539-96fc-6129e768b38d.png)

We have a fast path for `A` in `TestMethod` but it won't be taken since I actually pass an instance of `B`. In my PR this problem is fixed - `A` is replaced with `likelyClass` which is `B`.

Add CI tests for notification profilers, and fix a couple things to make life with multiple profilers easier
* Reduced default timeout for profiler detach - we used to try at 300ms, 600ms, and then 10 minutes
* Got rid of a couple asserts that were wrong since switching from the dedicated profiler attach thread to the diagnostics server implementation
* ProfControlBlock::GetProfilerInfo would only work for active profilers, not attaching profilers, which could cause subtle bugs

Let me see if I can fix that up. But I would not hold this PR for that. This PR is at least some progress (assuming I did it correctly 😄)"
"My take on this was:

- The sourcebuild team seemed supportive of the stream of changes around here. The changes were small and largely innocuous. They didn't really affect how we build the product, but enabled a customer's scenario of how they wanted to build the product. To me, in open source that's something we should support if it's not detrimental to the product. 
- Yes, portable builds are great for most things, but for that to work in the .NET ecosystem we always have to build in the lowest common denominator. We don't configure native builds in a way that all places where we toggle logic based on OS features can be done through runtime detection. They are often ifdef's that get enabled based on where we run CMake checks. You can build in a system that has the features you want to enable those paths, but that build is no longer portable. This felt like a reasonable mechanism to signify that. The main downside is the RID graph becomes crazy then for nuget and all the restore logic, but for a distro build of the SDK this didn't feel absurd."
"> COM doesn't support varargs. Can you point me at the location where this is used in the shuffle?

The field is used here:

Yes, I agree. However if we wanted we could swap the ""public interface, internal class"" pair with a ""public abstract class, internal concrete subclass"" pair. That has the benefit of letting us add more members in the future non-breakingly.

The `RegisterRefactoring` [just calls](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fL86) `_registerRefactoring` lambda with given parameters and so if we want to call it with `null` the [lambda](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fR30) needs to be of type `Action<CodeAction, TextSpan?>` (has to accept nullable `TextSpan`).

The lambda, however, isn't an implementation detail. It gets set in [*public* constructor](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fR52). And that leaks the information that the registration should somehow work with Nullable `applicableToSpan` 🤷‍♂️.

It's not terrible, nobody outside probably uses the constructor. But it _just feels weird_. Either have it nullable explicitly in `RegisterRefactoring` (but that communicates wrong idea about it being optional) or have it nowhere.

> Note: we [still support](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fR45) the original constructor without `TextSpan applicableToSpan` parameter

"This is wrong, you shouldn't need an space here as we add an space when passing the arguments down to the build script on the build step. Also this is only passed down when `isOfficialBuild == true` which in CI is never true, so this is not affecting your CI build. Also, remove the quotes around 'true' in the isOfficialBuild conditional as that might cause trouble in yml when evaluating booleans. I think the problem is somewhere in this condition here:

"The IDE has a different pattern than the compiler here: make the test assert what _should_ happen and then skip the test by putting the bug number in the skip attribute.

"`NotSupportedException` is generally used as the entire body of a method that doesn't make sense for a class that it's required to have because of a base class, interface, or compiler-recognized pattern.  Less often it's used for ""you're in the wrong mode"", e.g. a FileStream will report false for CanWrite if it was opened read-only, and Stream.Write will throw an NSE if CanWrite is false.

But for InvalidOperationException:

* DO throw an InvalidOperationException if the object is in an inappropriate state.

The state of this object is to write per some conformance mode, and that conformance mode says no indefinite arrays... so InvalidOperationException seems correct to me."

"Hi.

1) How does the component calculate the space for the content when expanded? As a test I added the expander around a vertical chat list of mine, and this is the result:
![Temp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60286968/79513737-34821980-804d-11ea-84d1-13d954f7fbab.gif)
As can be seen, the expander only shows around half of the height of the content. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?

2) I set the header up as such:
`
                            <StackLayout Orientation=""Horizontal"">
                                <Label Text=""Test2"" />

                            </StackLayout>
`

Just having a label is of course not enough to denote a foldable area, as the customer would never know it's a tappable widget. So I wanted to test having an upwards arrow indicator that turns into a downwards arrow when expanded. I couldn't find any easy way of doing it. Please advice on how to add a visual element that toggles between two states depending on whether the expander is folded or not. If this is not supported I'd urge to add support for it as I can't see much use for an expander that can't visualise its state.

Thank you."
"`FeaturesResources.operator_` is probably wrong here. It should be pluralized:  `FeaturesResources.Operators`, but this resource does not exist. Should I add it?

* TypeScript can cap the amount of results it returns, mark results as incomplete so that ask again on subsequent typing"

"> Maybe the island window is placing itself on top of the draw window on a resize, and we just need to move the drag window back on top of the island window (in the z-order)? I'm no expert here so that's just a guess.

Sorry I've explained the problem badly. The problem is that when I resize the window with `SetWindowPos` or `MoveWindow`, it looks like it doesn't do anything! The new area of the window doesn't receive any `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` messages, as if the resize didn't happen. Maybe I'm using the API wrong. I checked with a tool and the window's size actually changes, but it just doesn't receive any mouse message over the new area. If I recreate the window with the new position and width, it works again. I'm no expert either. "

"> Any idea how long a ""quick"" change will now be, e.g. a Documentation change (no tests at all!)? Can we get a ""lower-bound"" for turnaround time? Will the ""upper time"" be any worse?

From what I've seen so far these changes allow for ~2 hour PR builds (though I've seen a 98 minute run). Our build job takes roughly an hour on average, and this PR will still run four test jobs by default for every PR build (the longest of which can also take up to an hour). In theory a documentation change wouldn't even require a build, perhaps we can look at improving this further for certain source paths in the future.

Upper bound timing should be mostly unchanged, though it's possible we see some minor improvements there. Our longest jobs are typically Nodes 1 and 3 of our Legacy or One .NET MSBuild tests, and these jobs will now skip tests marked with the `SmokeTest` category (as they will have ran during the smoke test stage). 


> Another crazy idea: add or $(System.JobAttempt) > 1 to the conditions, and then we could click the Rerun stage button to kick off tests from the UI. 😉

I really like the idea of using `$(System.StageAttempt)` or `$(System.JobAttempt)` as a way of running extra test jobs without having to queue a new instance, but I think I'd want to try to experiment with that in a separate PR as the scope has grown quite a bit already."

"It isn't wrong from a technical perspective, since that is how it can be done. However, what is stated is misleading and isn't what is really desired . This API shouldn't be considered an export of `objc_msgSend` because it isn't. In this form it is a specialized use case for `objc_msgSend` with no arguments and that is confusing given how this function actually operates. We also hit concerns with one of the new APIs being introduced around overriding the export look up. I was preferring this to be done in Objective-C naturally instead of expose its weirdness at the C# level.

This also makes the C# far more common for those who maintain it and pushes the Objective-C semantics to be the responsibility of the Objective-C compiler."
"My interpretation of the TODO question is to decide if we instead want something like:

And have the strategy itself determine what the logic would be:

{
  ...
  public override IntPtr GetHandle() => SafeFileHandle.DangerousGetHandle();
  ...
}
```

But please correct me if I'm wrong, @github.

If it's what I described, then I think I would prefer to have _all_ logic moved to the strategy itself. It would be consistent with other properties: `IsClosed`, `CanSeek`, `CanRead`, `CanWrite`, `Name`, `IsAsync`, etc.

If it's what @github described - Then I think having `_strategy.SafeFileHandle` would made make sense than calling `SafeFileHandle` directly, since the logic is _kind of_ deferred to the strategy, but this would not be consistent with how other properties are working."
"Please don't add `JavaNativeTypeManager.GetJniSignature(mi)` to this codepath.  It's already reflection heavy, and this would only make it *worse*:

Only the name is required.

For further rationale, build e.g. `samples/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.csproj`, and then view `samples/HelloWorld//HelloWorld/obj/Debug/android/src/example/MainActivity.java`:

```java
		__md_methods = 
			""n_onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V:GetOnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_Handler\n"" +
			"""";
		mono.android.Runtime.register (""HelloWorld.MainActivity, HelloWorld"", MainActivity.class, __md_methods);
```

The method this will lookup is `GetOnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_Handler`.  That's *very* unique, and not likely to cause conflicts.

*Furthermore*, the types are wrong; `signature` would be `(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V`, while `GetOnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_Handler` (generated in e.g. `src/Mono.Android/obj/Debug/monoandroid10/android-32/mcw/Android.App.Activity.cs`) is:

```csharp
		static Delegate GetOnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_Handler ()
		{
			if (cb_onCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_ == null)
				cb_onCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_ = JNINativeWrapper.CreateDelegate ((_JniMarshal_PPL_V) n_OnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_);
			return cb_onCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_;
		}
```

which would imply a ""signature"" of `()V` (no parameters, returns `void`), which *will rarely match*."
"> 5. The app aborts at run time instead.

I think this is basically what you got with dx + proguard ^^ You get runtime errors and have to read the build log to figure out what is wrong.

If I change this test to use dx+proguard instead of multi-dex:

I get warnings and it builds. But if I switch to r8, it will error unless we supply `-ignorewarnings`.

After `-ignorewarnings`, you get the same amount of warnings, but the build succeeds.

I think we should go with `-ignorewarnings` for all usage of r8, and I just need to add some release notes here?

"I just want to say that I have done some testing with the exising CreateProcess flag `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE`. The case I tried was not documented anywhere by Microsoft as far as I could find, and the results were unexpected *to me*.

I have an `.exe` that's a GUI application and has an option to print output to a console. It is an official Microsoft tool actually, `dpinst.exe` with its `/C` argument. From my observations, this is a GUI exe and when you add the `/C` option it attaches to the parent-process' console and prints to `CONOUT$` (not Standard Output ...).

It was my impression that, when I launch `dpinst.exe /C` with CreateProcess and CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE, a console would be attached to the process. But that's not the case. It appears CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE currently has absolutely no effect on GUI-subsystem executables! There was no new console window or process created and dpinst continued to print its output to the *parent* process' console.

To me this was unexpected. If a GUI program can call AllocConsole to gain a console, why can't I force that at process creation time with a Flag that's supposed to do exactly that? It works for TUI programs.

I don't have the source code for `dpinst.exe`, you guys do. Does it just always do a `AttachConsole( ATTACH_PARENT_PROCESS);` regardless of whether it already has a console itself? Or maybe I did something wrong, but I find it very odd I am not able to spawn a GUI process with a ""forced"" console attached by default and I would like to be able to do that in the future if the APIs around this are going to be expanded :)"

"> So if, with hindsight, Yarn and PNPM are now seeking to replace `node_modules` with a more industrial strength resolver, why not just propose a really great design, and everyone can adopt that?

Because as always, the question isn't to have a great design but rather to gather support around it. When you consider that even now the only package manager in Node is controlled by a for-profit and that it takes **crazy significant** efforts to improve even that, I can't imagine the amount of work that a proposal such as Plug'n'Play would require - and how much of my family time it would consume.

So of course in an ideal world PnP should be implemented in Node, and I'd be open to help with that (or even do most of the work), but it likely won't happen until the Node TSC comes to us with a firm Intent to Implement so that I know it won't be all for nothing. In the meantime, the best I can do is to [document the standard and API](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnpapi) the best I can and work with third-party project to make ""PnP as a plugin"" a reality. I think it worked very well so far, even though there's still this kind of PR every once in a while.

> I'd like to hear more motivation for having an executable format for the pnp file.

This point in particular got discussed a few times already (for example [here](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6388)), but I think the TS team demonstrated since then why the executable format is just fine: the data format actually got implemented in May 2019 - a year and a half ago - but it didn't do anything to bring PnP closer from TS. Given that it was literally its only purpose, it shows that we should optimize the format for the convenience of our team rather than for theoretical use cases."

"I'm relatively new to the watch code, but I wanted to write out my understanding of the original code and this PR in case it clears things up (so do correct me if I'm wrong).

It seems like `watchPresentFileSystemEntry` will call `fs.watch` and only fall back to `watchPresentFileSystemEntryWithFsWatchFile` when needed. That function is documented in some comments as being based on polling (the function name is super long so I'm just going to call it ""the polling watcher"" from now on).

The original big long condition in `callbackChangingToMissingFileSystemEntry` is true when the there's a rename event and the file no longer exists, which then leads to the watcher being turned into a polling watcher that waits until an event fires, then recreates the watcher with `watchPresentFileSystemEntry` again.

The PR changes the condition to, on a rename, if it doesn't exist, do the same thing as above, but if it does exist, the watcher is recreated assuming that a rename event is likely to mean that the folder points somewhere else on disk via a different inode (as documented in the PR description), but is done so by calling that polling watcher creation function.

That latter point I think is the contentious one; I'd think that if we know (or very likely know) that the watcher is now bad, that it would need to be recreated via `watchPresentFileSystemEntry` in order to have it potentially pick the non-polling watcher again (as it would have originally).

But, it also feels like it _should_ be expensive to be recreating directory watches (which are potentially recursive) over and over again. Maybe that's why the PR uses polling in the first place, because those are effectively ""free"" given they defer work until some later poll as opposed to asking the system to do some work?

Maybe ideally, it'd be nice if there was a cheap way to just get the inode number of a directory and compare it without doing the work to recreate a watcher (but, this feels like something that node's watcher should really be handling, as the API is based on paths, and it sure would be a surprise for watchers to just totally stop working depending on the details of what some program does to rename or replace a directory/file with other contents or something)."
"> would it be possible to get stable guids here? Are we running it wrong that it churns guids every time?

Answering my own question.  Looks like today the answer is no: https://github.com/microsoft/slngen/blob/04b9e981a2651f3b4aa7cbea9adeb855db927732/src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.SlnGen/SlnFolder.cs#L29

I'm not sure you can safely remove the serialization code. All of that logic is just boiler plate copied from xunit. Whenever it was wrong it failed a random unit scenario. If you change any of it make sure you do a test run where you pass the `-serialize` argument to xunit. That will force the issue and validate everything is correct.

"> I think having bold in the color table is an essential prerequisite for getting the bold color to work

LOL. Clearly I was wrong, since the bold seems to working fine in this PR as far as I can tell.

That said, I still think this functionality should probably not be enabled by default, because there are going to be edges cases that don't work, and that's kind of inevitable when we're deliberately choosing to alter the colors that were requested.

As one example, if you're using a ""standard"" color scheme, like Campbell, where the default background is identical to black, and the default foreground is identical to white, then both these sequences should be invisible, but they aren't:

    printf ""\e[0;30mHIDDEN\e[m\n""
    printf ""\e[0;47mHIDDEN\e[m\n""

That particular case may be fixable, but there'll always be something. Having the default behavior be technically incorrect feels like we're asking for bug reports."

"I was wrong, there wasn't any more to the situation than that, and moving the hash set within the driver was easy.

Making that change now is less pressing with management of this issue moved completely within the driver.
"
"@github @github 
The <a href=""https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/16646#pullrequestreview-47396091"">original justification</a> for the change was: to make version parsing easier.

Given how parsing issues escalated, while compiler gained unnecessary variable and all these troubling cross-referencing comments — is it better to revisit?

If TSC goes back to dumb simple `export const version = ""2.5.0"";` all these quirks go away. More to it, built TSC.JS has version in a plain parseable format.

Compare old simple way:
``` typescript
(function (ts) {
    ts.version = ""2.4.1"";
})(ts || (ts = {}));
```

With what we got today:
```typescript
(function (ts) {
    ts.versionMajorMinor = ""2.5"";
    ts.version = ts.versionMajorMinor + "".0-dev.20170719"";
})(ts || (ts = {}));
```

All that trouble for the sake of splitting `versionMajorMinor` off `version`. Could have just gone `version.split('.').slice(0,2).join('.')`."
Type is wrong. Should be `...arg0: any[]` that little bit not being implemented is probably why it was asserted.
"> I think that this should be kept.

I agree. As I said, this is just not the right place for it, it makes:

a) `fgArgTabEntry::getSize` return the wrong value on LA for this special case.
b) Refactoring `fgMorphArgs` harder and riskier (and that function is already notoriously fragile), due to its placement outside the `else`."
"This is doesn't preserve the order in which expressions are visited, which leads to a wrong behavior when duplicate declarations are involved. Please fix.

"Aren't all special types and members required to be in a valid corlib? I believe so and if that's true then any existing tests were testing the wrong thing.
"
"this was just wrong, as far as I can tell, but only was used for tags followed by a newline:

```js

"We don't necessarily need the temp variable when we're *not* using the value, but I also think this emit is wrong when we *do* use the value.

Consider:
```js
let a = ""0"";
let b = a++;
console.log(typeof a, a); // number 1
console.log(typeof b, b); // number 0
```
If we use `_a` here, it should already have been coerced to a number, so the emit should start with `_a = +__classPrivateFieldGet(this, _text)`.

Please modify this test to include cases where the value of the expression is used (i.e. `x = this.#test++`)."

"> While the semantic meaning is the same, the original code much more clearly conveys intent. Using u8 obscures the intent.

"In the case of a named import, the `type` modifier need not be present _on_ the named import; it could be present on the parent import declaration... afraid calling this “TypeOnlyModifierBlah” makes you focus on the wrong thing."
"> One of the primary drivers was concern around non-determinism, and whether folks might write catch blocks for just the target exception and not realize they need to handle an aggregate as well, and then even if they did realize it, end up needing to duplicate all of their exception handling logic to handle both the single and aggregate cases.

I can definitely see where that's coming from, but I wonder if suppressing exception information is desireable in principle: it could be argued, especially if you subscribe to the ""let it crash"" school of thought, that logging exceptions is more important than handling them.

In this particular case it probably doesn't matter, I don't think STJ users would or should try to handle this particular exception. It's meant to address a corner case of a corner case, where there is likely something wrong in their `I(Async)Disposable` implementation, so reporting back with as much information as possible seems appropriate."
"> From discussion with Carlos: the only thing I'd really want to block over is the flag pointing the wrong direction when it's at a terminus. It's highly visible -- moreso than a usability issue -- and we'll be hitting the streets with it pretty soon. I suspect somebody will trip over the visual glitch in approximately the first eight seconds. 😄

This is done. But I'm gonna take it a step further in the next commit. Instead of wrapping the marker onto the previous/next line, just flip it. That's a lot more intuitive.

It requires a few changes to the `SelectionXForRendering` funcs, but not difficult at all."
"@github We're planning on shipping this in Preview 1.15, the next Terminal release. Typically, these releases are about 6 weeks apart. We'll get to elaborating on the docs once we get closer to release.

Trying to parse everything there and translate it to what we've got so far:
* ""click and drag (highlight) somewhere with the mouse""->""press any arrow key while holding shift""
  - I think this actually shipped in 1.13, IIRC. Definitely in 1.14.
* ""At this point you can release the left-click (1) or shift (2). ... and you can now move anywhere with just the arrow keys""
  - @github would have to clarify this one for me. I _think_ that at this point, just arrow keys won't move the cursor. 
  - HOWEVER, if you started the selection by pressing `ctrl+shift+m` (or whatever you bind mark mode to), then just arrow keys _will_ move the cursor.
* ""To highlight you then hold shift while using arrow keys similar to the highlighting logic of holding left-click while moving the mouse.""
  - Yep, that's how mark mode works.
* ""Copying can happen in 2 ways:....""
  - This I _don't_ think we have today (again, Carlos correct me if I'm wrong). We may need to add an arg to `copyText` to specifically ask that the selection is not dismissed."
I'm losing my mind... I updated the wrong file ;-)
"So they added a new function that ends up with the same signature for us 😒 

The `2` suffix makes it sound like we did something wrong... but no other good option comes to mind either. Maybe `CanPerformUnwindAction`? `CanPerformSegueUnwind`? `CanPerformUnwindSegueAction`?

Also maybe add some `#if XAMCORE_4_0` spaghetti to rename the old function `CanPerformUnwindDeprecated` and the new one `CanPerformUnwind`."

"I believe returning the default from the system is better than OS UI one. We'll be consistent across all configurations. This is more predictable. This matches the resource lookup in general too to always fallback to specific set of resources.
Also, I explained a concerns in my email communication regarding step 3 which I believe it is wrong to do it. 

> Basically the problem comes when you've got say en-US as default and es-ES installed also. If the user asks for a time zone string for es-MX, we need to return the one from es-ES, not the one from en-US.

I am not sure why you are seeing it as a problem. This is different than we do the resource lookup in the .NET. why we need to be different here? We are not trying to invent something new here or different than how the rest of the resource lookup work. "
"This is both right and wrong at the same time.

It's right in the sense that you're removing `#if !MONOMAC`, and then to get the same result you need to add this attribute.
It's wrong because these APIs seem to actually exist in macOS (12).

I'm guessing we added these APIs at some point, with the correct availability attributes, not realizing that the code was inside a `#if !MONOMAC` block, and as such the API wouldn't be exposed on macOS.

The correct fix here is to maintain the attributes as-is (and remove the `#if MONOMAC` condition as you do), and then verify with intro/xtro/documentation that these APIs actually exist and are correct on macOS.

That's much bigger than just a mechanical conversion of this framework, but I think it's worth it (it's also a pretty small framework, so it shouldn't be too much work)."
"> I think a delayed diagnostic will address the concerns and ensure we don't have duplicate diagnostics.

I don't think the delayed diagnostics is the right approach here. Mainly because we will have to control when it is getting resolved, which is hard to do given that we are trying to move the work from one pipeline phase to the other.

>It's very flaky. Not only the new test. But I see other existing tests can randomly have the diagnostics from the compilation of the new test. I can't understand how the diagnostics leaked into a whole different compilation.

>It's likely I'm reusing a diagnostic bag that shouldn't be reused, but still looks very weird it's leaking into a different compilation.

Let's take a look at what you tried to do and see what is going wrong. Update this PR with that. I have a high confidence that ```MarkBackingFieldAsCalculated``` approach will work. In fact, it is very likely that later we will move/add reporting of even more diagnostics there."
"There's existing code a few lines before this that's doing:
```C#
var ctor = ((MethodSymbol)this._module.Compilation.GetWellKnownTypeMember(WellKnownMember.System_ReadOnlySpan_T__ctor_Pointer));
if (ctor == null)
{
    return false;
}
```
without checking diagnostics. Is that also wrong?  I was just copying what's already being done in this file."
"So as I understand it the purpose of the ""does overflow"" checks is that RangeCheck does not model overflow (since it cannot...).

Except in the special case of all constant ranges it seems:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/a3b186b9904844b8001d4bb5d7474f2591ee96d9/src/coreclr/jit/rangecheck.h#L238-L251

So _I think_ that the assertion ""if the ranges are all constant, there could have been no overflow"" is correct.

Now, what is perhaps far more curious is the ""does it overflow"" logic itself, which says that if the end result of the SSA use-def chain walk is an `IND`, it does not overflow. This makes sense insofar as RangeCheck does not work with indirections, thus could not have drawn wrong conclusions earlier, when computing the ranges (another way to put it is that an indirection in the dependency chain will always be terminating, not result in a dependent range).

What makes me wonder then is why don't we consider chains ending in, say, parameters (as is the case here) as non-overflowing."

"It might be worth throwing an error if `DefinitelyTypedRunner.testDir` is empty/does not exist (rather than the usual behavior of `getDirectories`, which I believe just produces `undefined` or an empty list).

I don't know 😉 But with `Vector128<ushort>` (for char) it's 8 chars and vectorization can be done. So my feeling* is that this threshould is hit quite often. Of course I could be wrong here too.
I'll try it and see if the additional complexity is worth it.

"We might be able to heuristically recognize type-specializing opcode sequences and branching patterns during our initial IL scan/profitability check. At this level we would not know what methods get called and whether or not they are intrinsic. It would be pretty ad-hoc as we can't even do simple dataflow at that level today.

Assuming we could guess right much of the time, we could ""discount"" the cost of the candidate to be the estimated cost of one of the branch cases plus the cost of any ""unconditional"" IL, and provisionally accept the inline. I have written heuristics like this in the past and they're tricky to get right without fairly strong models for control flow; we don't have that here either.

Similar perhaps for size-specializing patterns.

When we actually go to import the inlinee, if it then turned out we were wrong and things didn't simplify, we could reject then to keep code size small. But we'd have burned a fair bit of jit time and memory in the process.

So the key would be to get good recognition accuracy, so that jit throughput is not unduly impacted by things that look promising but don't pan out.

An alternative is to try and do this recognition either in the language compiler or in some other precompilation tool and just leave breadcrumbs for the jit."
"> If there's a mechanical fix to update existing code, it'd worthwhile to have that in the release notes for 3.9.

Write an `Extract` everywhere we now (correctly) flag as a type error, `(or, better yet, write types that actually check out without contortions). It's the typesystem equivalent of a typecast, but it's much more explicit.

eg,
```ts
type GetClass<T extends any> = T[""class""];

// could be
type GetClass<T> = Extract<T, {class: any}>[""class""];
```
obviously, you can replace `Extract` with a helper that provides a more reasonable default on failure than `never` for your given situation, too.

It was possible for us to underestimate the size of temps required. This
happened because we used the state of the frame layout to check if the
size of temps was computed and that check was wrong. This could lead us
to make different decisions about which registers needed to be saved in
the prolog and epilog on ARM32. In particular, if the frame size was
around the size where a stack probe is necessary, this could be
possible.

There are also other comments that suggest that this could result in
failure while encoding instructions that reference the stack locals.

"@github I have a suggested refactoring to make (though it is almost certainly not an appropriate time to perform that suggestion).  Specifically, I believe the existing system for ScanXXX+ParseXXX in LanguageParser amounts to a huge amount of complexity for little (if any) gain.  I have an alternate approach i think would be superior and better for the long term health of the parser.

The primary problem today is that the parser needs to encode all the parsing rules all over again into the ScanXXX functions , keeping both in sync, and trying to ensure that the appropriate results from scanning carry over to parsing. 

There is an alternative approach that can be taken, which we followed in TypeScript.  You can see that approach here:
https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/src/compiler/parser.ts#L1020  (example explained in more depth below).

Specifically, instead of actually having a separate scanning step, we just went ahead and tried the parse, passing in whatever flags were appropriate for the current parse context, and specifying what behavior we wanted if the parse ran into issues.  Effectively, with LanguageParser, this would just be using reset points, and asking to rollback once enough information was gleaned from the parse to determine that the wrong speculative path had been taken.

The concern with this approach was of course one of allocation cost.  i.e. would the cost of allocations be a hindrance to parsing speed.  In practice, we found that cost to be completely negligible in most cases, and easily worked around in the rare cases where it did impact.  Specifically, we found that the majority of code tends to follow a more common case, and that case should be what the speculative parsing code looks for first.  In the rare cases where that doesn't follow, usually a little lookahead (which is vastly less complex than the arbitrary 'scanning' subsystem that we have) can allow for a sensible direction to take.  And, when that doesn't suffice, you do just do the arbitrary parsing+rollback.

--

I only bring this up because i know how tricky it's been over time to try to get scanning+parsing to work with these more and more complex expression constructs.  While it would not be trivial to move off of scanning, I do think it would make for a vastly simpler system, and would actually pay dividends later as new language features would be easier to incorporate.

Anyways, just my 2c.  If you'd like to discuss this further (including offline, or not in this PR) I'm happy to assist.

--

Example: explained.  

Here's an example of how TS deals with the ```<``` ambiguity we also have in C#:

```c#
                    // See if this is the start of a generic invocation.  If so, consume it and
                    // keep checking for postfix expressions.  Otherwise, it's just a '<' that's
                    // part of an arithmetic expression.  Break out so we consume it higher in the
                    // stack.
                    const typeArguments = tryParse(parseTypeArgumentsInExpression);
...
        function parseTypeArgumentsInExpression() {
            if (!parseOptional(SyntaxKind.LessThanToken)) {
                return undefined;
            }

            const typeArguments = parseDelimitedList(ParsingContext.TypeArguments, parseType);
            if (!parseExpected(SyntaxKind.GreaterThanToken)) {
                // If it doesn't have the closing >  then it's definitely not an type argument list.
                return undefined;
            }

            // If we have a '<', then only parse this as a argument list if the type arguments
            // are complete and we have an open paren.  if we don't, rewind and return nothing.
            return typeArguments && canFollowTypeArgumentsInExpression()
                ? typeArguments
                : undefined;
        }
```

Here, there's no need for a separate ScanTypeArgumentList function.  TypeScript simply goes through and actually attempts the parse, easily falling back if it fails.  Because the logic is just in a single place, there aren't two codepaths to keep in sync.  Also, this code can be extremely flexible.  For example, we could have code like the above, but extend it so that if we see things like primitive types (i.e. int/string/etc.) in the delimited list, then we would always consider it a type argument list.  i.e. ```List<int>``` would always parse as a type-arg list, even though it isn't followed by something like ```(```.

Right now we accomplish that in the scanning phase, but it's extremely tricky to get right.  By moving it right into the parsing phase, we can do much richer analysis as we have the full tree up to that point (as well as any future tokens) to look at at make determinations.

--

In the end, everything can be done with ScanXXX.  But it really does add lots of complexity (esp. as expressions have gotten a lot more ambiguous).  Moving away from this into a simpler ""just do the parse and make the decisions based on how it's gone and what you can see coming up"" can make life much simpler and easier.

- Or, make the method body call `DacNotImpl();`. This one is still not ideal because of the method is still not going to work when called under DAC, but at least the failure is easy to see and diagnose."

"I think we should change this to return just the app name - so without the `.dll`. After all that's what the caller wants.
The assert is I think partially wrong - it can in theory happen that the file is not called `.exe` on windows, or that it will be called `.exe` on Linux - I can still make it run (I think - does CreateProcess block running something which is not called .exe?).

I actually think we should make this a runtime check and fail if it's not the case since we won't know what to do with it otherwise."
"It kind of sucks, but the only solution I can think of now is to use one of the ""dangerous"" APIs - like `Assembly.GetType` or maybe even better (more future proof) `Assembly.GetTypes` and effectively write the ""GetType"" functionality manually. Perf-wise this should not matter that much - especially if the result is cached (the above doesn't cache it, so it's pretty inefficient). Would obviously require suppress warning attributes as well.

I think the only ""correct"" solution is adding a public API which describes the intent - so something like `Type.GetTypeIfExists` (probably needs better name) which would intentionally be marked as 'trim friendly"" without any intrinsic handling in the linker."
"It feels to me that relying on IsImplicitlyDeclared to decide whether to include names is fragile and probably a wrong thing to do.

2. for #6986: we'll need _a lot_ of tests to make sure this works correctly. The idea here is that anything past the ""document end"" will be treated as a degenerate range at document end.

"@github I don't see any reason why ""Begin"" as a normal verb (not any sort of keyword) needs to capitalized. Probably it was just written wrong once and copied/pasted in all summaries."
"@github, I am the author of [@github/mutrait](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/mutrait), which enables stateful traits in JavaScript.  I'm trying to use what this PR enables in order to implement a similar thing in TypeScript, but I'm still not sure if the language's type system permits it.  I have a github repo demonstrating the issue at https://github.com/matthewadams/typescript-trait-test.

TL;DR: I'm basically trying to enable a simple way for folks to define traits & enable their classes to express them, like `class Person extends trait(Nameable) { ... }` (one trait) or `class Person extends traits(Nameable).with(HasParents).with(HasChildren).apply() { ... }` (multiple traits).  The traits provide default implementations of isolated functionality, and the goal is that classes expressing traits can override methods provided by the trait.

This leverages the subclass factory pattern you describe at the top of this issue, but attempts to do so in a way that allows a class to override functionality.  Your example illustrates that you can add functionality to a class, but you can't customize it easily because the subclass factory-created class _extends_ the class receiving the functionality, instead of the other way around.

This works fine in JavaScript using `@github/mutrait`, and we use it with great success.  I'm just having some trouble describing the typing correctly.  If you could have a look at my repo and tell me if I'm doing something wrong, or if TypeScript's typing system doesn't support what I'm trying to do, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks in advance for this.  Because we leverage traits in many of our projects, this is preventing us from using TypeScript more often."
"The BCL ultimately calls the system APIs for things like socket communication and add a C# API on top of it.

The issue I described above is with the remote reverse server, _not_ the code in runtime itself.  This is effectively a test issue and not a product issue.  The runtime is doing the correct thing, but the ""correct"" thing is resulting in a hang because the system level APIs are not behaving.

I would not expect a well behaved reverse server to operate like this.  I would expect it to behave as you describe, i.e., create the socket once, bind to it, and manage the returned sockets from calls to `accept`.  This test is specifically designed to stress the polling and retry logic of the runtime in the presence of a misbehaving reverse server.  In other words, the test server is supposed to be doing the wrong thing and the runtime should be able to handle it.

The race I observed seems to be something unique to macOS and how the socket APIs behave.  I'd be curious to see if this behavior repros on other BSD based operating systems.  I would expect the BCL to fall prey to this same race on macOS since Syetm.Net.Sockets ultimately calls the same APIs as my C++/C# code is.  There isn't anything in the BCL that could prevent this since it has to do with the order that system level APIs are called and not the infrastructure (like the async engine) that the BCL adds on top of that."

The Arcade.SDK already package refrences the ILLink package. The
duplicate reference in illink.targets caused SDK errors as the Arcade
reference has IsImplicitlyDefined set which doesn't allow an additional
reference with the same identity.

Also, as the ILLink package already exposes the path to the assembly via
its props file, using that instead of manually constructing the path to
the assembly.

The SDK target version update is required as the sequencing of the
ILLink.props file was wrong and is required for this change. This isn't
considered a breaking change, as the SDK's minimum required version
isn't changed.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime

In ImmutableList.cs, just like ""IndexOf()"" and the last ""LastIndexOf()"" method, we don't need to do checks for list.Count generated by dotnet-robot, because when it equals to 0, it will return you -1 instead of throwing exceptions.

On the other hand, there's something wrong with the check:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/84bad7e24589169975ec8a599743110d703c761b/src/libraries/System.Collections.Immutable/src/System/Collections/Immutable/ImmutableList.cs#L289-L292

In fact, when list.Count = 0, this already means we've no elements there, no need to check ""startIndex = 0"".

"The version string is being used in the following places for wasm/workload testing:

"@github What do you mean by deprecating RIDs for linux? There is no single Linux we could use (yeah, the current naming is wrong) so different Linux distributions could be (e.g. due to different libc) incompatible."
"@github, correct. The apphost package (`microsoft.netcore.app.crossgen2.<platform>-<arch>.<version>.nupkg`) restored for crossgen2 on the `main` branch is using linux-x64 when we pass `-cross` or `-p:CrossBuild=true` to `./build.sh`. Which is incorrect when target is anything other than linux-x64. The crossgen2 tool used to cross build _during_ the build is correct (i.e. when `CrossBuild = true`, it should use CG2 built with host compatible apphost, rather than that of target's).

The reason why we don't see any error on main branch is because of the wrong `Crossgen2PackageRID` value which is fixed by first commit in this PR. With that fix, the FreeBSD CI leg started to fail during apphost package restore like this:

> .dotnet/sdk/6.0.100/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.FrameworkReferenceResolution.targets(129,5): error NETSDK1084: (NETCORE_ENGINEERING_TELEMETRY=Restore) There is no application host available for the specified RuntimeIdentifier 'freebsd-x64'.

The second commit disables crossgen2 project build on FreeBSD package generation in cross build mode. It was already partially disabled, but not properly excluded since the issue was hidden due to the said bug. When #66866 is resolved, we can enable it back."
"Using `LowLevelMonitor` actually solves the problem of this PR, but perhaps for a wrong reason. `LowLevelMonitor` is a reentrant lock and that allows nested `CreateThreadLocalCountObject`, it just creates a redundant `ThreadLocalNode` in a very rare scenario. Seems better than a deadlock though.

Reentering the type system may be a bigger concern, although it might be ok and even expected since typesystem might need to access itself recursively anyways."
Wrong namespace
"Not sure if this is totally supported since the image will have to be re-generated when the accessibility settings change. I think we have support for when the density/resolution changes, so this is not crazy."

"Right, this could work for MVC controllers, not for pages. It doesn't help with the case also where you put auth middleware somewhere crazy. "
"Perhaps I'm wrong or misunderstanding how things work but it was my understanding that without `volatile`, it's entirely possible for lines like this to be reordered by the CPU.

If this seems to fix the race, then maybe it's moot, but I don't know that we can **assert** strongly that the ordering issue is resolved by a change like this."

[This](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/c7a4f10920aaea283106d2dc7a85a7f9038da25c/src/MessagePack/MessagePackBinary.cs#L1394) is the force 5 bytes behavior method from v1.8, which you were _not_ calling.

Now consider [v2.0's `Write(int)` method](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/9ed868e36921eb27ce68400c3fa38f2a5e456a00/src/MessagePack.UnityClient/Assets/Scripts/MessagePack/MessagePackWriter.cs#L399) which compresses and [v2.0's `WriteInt32(int)`](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/9ed868e36921eb27ce68400c3fa38f2a5e456a00/src/MessagePack.UnityClient/Assets/Scripts/MessagePack/MessagePackWriter.cs#L439) which does _not_ compress.

Therefore the equivalency table is:

| MessagePackBinary.WriteInt32 | MessagePackWriter.Write(int) |
| MessagePackBinary.WriteInt32ForceInt32Block | MessagePackWriter.WriteInt32 |"
"@github that is a fair point, but we'd probably only file NFWs for specific failures. For instance, if we can't find the requested service we would *not* file an NFW as that could be very much by design for a componentized, optional install model -- or just development error on the part of the caller. But if something infrastructural goes wrong (an internal error of ServiceHub) than ideally ServiceHub should file the NFW, I agree."

"> Could this issue be the cause instead?

It's possible but somewhat unlikely. The two property values I'm setting here were wrong for a small subset of the projects and mainly when we're using stable versions. We're not using stable versions (outside a servicing readiness exercise) for 5.0 yet. So, this PR should have minimal impact -- for now.

The main exception is if we needed the shared Fx or targeting pack version in a project using SemVer 1.0. So far, we're :ok: there.

So, @github's fix in your PR is on the right path. Any place we made assumptions that dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore sharedFx or TFM and dotnet/aspnetcore sharedFx versions align is usually wrong."

"@github Thanks very much for moving this forwards and continuing to refine it! Mostly this looks like really good stuff, but one aspect of the implementation makes me think we could refine it further. I suppose there are two aspects:

 * Trying to capture the `byte[]` instances in a context-specific way using unusual techniques like relying on non-nested invocations, the `Semaphore`, etc. This is kind of complex and subtle, and would at the very least need to get more complex still to handle nested invocations (which actually are a thing, since you can put a `[JsonConverter]` on any type and then put inside it custom logic which could in turn do JS interop or other serialization).
 * Passing the `byte[][]` parameters through all the various layers has a very noisy impact all over the API surface, and means this will always be a thing we have to allow for when doing any future maintenance on JS interop.

I think there could be an alternative way to capture and pass the `byte[]` instances that avoids both of these problems, plus is simpler overall. That is:

 * For the .NET-to-JS direction:
   * The `JSRuntime` base class could set up a single `ByteArrayJsonConverter` that, whenever it sees a `byte[]`, *immediately* gives it an incrementing ID and passes the `byte[]` to JS without tracking it anywhere in .NET memory, and uses the ID in the serialized JSON (e.g., `{ __dotNetByteArray: 123 }`).
   * For example, `JSRuntime` could have a new method like `protected virtual void SupplyByteArray(long id, byte[] data)`, whose default implementation just throws `NotSupportedException`
   * Each `JSRuntime` subclass can take care of getting the array over to JS and calling some new function inside `Microsoft.JSInterop.ts` like `DotNet.jsCallDispatcher.supplyByteArray(id: number, data: UInt8Array)`. The implementation of that function tracks the id/data pair in some `Map<number, UInt8Array>`.
   * Of course, when `Microsoft.JSInterop.ts` is later deserializing JSON, it can react to `{ __dotNetByteArray: 123 }` by removing the corresponding instance from the map and supplying it.
   * This naturally cleans up after itself *as long as .NET never throws during JSON serialization*. If it does, then the JS side might never remove some of these `Map` entries, but I don't think that's a big problem because (1) people shouldn't have exceptions during JSON serialization, and if they do, then normally the user's session will be terminated anyway, and (2) JS memory isn't as security-critical like .NET memory is for Blazor Server, and (3) if this ends up being a concern in the long run, we could set up some timer-based thing on the JS side to clean up any entries that haven't been consumed after some timeout.
 * For the JS-to-.NET direction, the exact same technique could be used, with a couple of minor variations.
   * `Microsoft.JSInterop.ts` would respond to seeing a `UInt8Array` by immediately calling some new function `DotNetCallDispatcher.supplyByteArray(index: number, data: UInt8Array)`. Each runtime platform would plug in some way of transporting the data and calling `DotNetDispatcher.SupplyByteArray` on the .NET side. Note that in this direction, the IDs can be call-specific indices (i.e., restarting at `0` for each call). This is safe because JS-side serialization is always singlethreaded, synchronous, and not-user-extensible, and is always synchronously followed by the actual invocation of .NET code, so we know there's always a continuous series of synchronous `supplyByteArray` calls that synchronously precede the `beginInvokeDotNet` or whatever it's called.
   * `DotNetDispatcher.SupplyByteArray` would track the incoming data in some `JSRuntime`-instance-specific `List<byte[]>`. For security, it would need to impose a rule that you can't supply too much data in total before the actual JS interop call that consumes the data. I'd recommend we have a rule that says the total byte length of all the `SupplyByteArray` calls cannot exceed the configured SignalR ""max message size"", just so there isn't an extra thing to configure.
   * Of course, the `JSRuntime` would also have a converter that sees incoming `{ __jsByteArray: 3 }`-type values and looks up the corresponding entry in the `List<byte[]>`. Finally, before dispatching the call into user code, it would empty out the `List<byte[]>` because we know it's now finished. It could also empty out that list each time it sees an incoming `index == 0`, in case any errors caused previous processes to be left incomplete.
   * The .NET side automatically keeps itself tidy and resilient to any leaks due to failure, because it never holds more bytes than ""max signalR message size"" and always empties the storage at the start of each new call. It doesn't have to worry about overlapping calls because that just isn't possible in this direction (the serialization and sending of messages is synchronous on the JS side). If it receives too much data, or out-of-order data, it can immediately just throw and let the circuit be torn down.

Sorry this was such a huge dump of ideas - just trying to be specific to avoid wasting any of your time. If any of it seems wrong, needs clarification, or you can think of any improvements, let me know! The main benefits of this kind of approach are that we avoid all the difficulties about threading/overlaps, plus we don't need to make any changes to the majority of the layers in the API (e.g., all the `BeginInvoke`/`EndInvoke`/etc method signatures wouldn't have to be changed at all). Does this make sense?"
Wrong direction
"❕ This is a collection initializer, not an object initializer (test is correct, but the method name here is wrong)"
Discussed offline and I was wrong here. I've updated the algorithm to handle it correctly: backwards jumps are now disallowed when the label and the using declaration are part of the same block.
"While the nameof was previously indented wrong, I liked the previous, chopped, style better.  This line now causes horizontal scrolling on the default github window width."
"I believe we had the reverse table, but I could be wrong."
"_resettableDelay makes sure that we at the end update status to correct value. _lastTimeReported make sure that we only update at least s_minimumInterval interval.

when an event stream comes in as below (assuming minimum interval is 200ms)

e1 -> (100ms)-> e2 -> (300ms)-> e3 -> (100ms) -> e4

actual status shown to users will be without _resettableDelay

e1 -> e3.

e2 and e4 will be skipped since internal is smaller than min interval. 

losing e2 is fine, but e4 is problematic since the user now sees the wrong status until the next event comes in. for example, it shows ""Evaluating"" when it is actually ""Paused"" until the next event.

what _resettableDelay does is making sure that if the next event doesn't come in within 200ms, it updates status to e4."
"I thought it wasn't necessary with global properties, since the only case which could have been impacted is if someone instantiates a `MSBuildWorkspace` with a `TargetFramework` property set to an empty string, which seemed wrong in the first place.

But I guess someone could instantiate `MSBuildWorkspace` with an empty `TargetFramework` but also a non-empty `TargetFrameworks` property to force a single-targeted project to use a different set of TFMs.

I can add some defensive code to handle this case.

One thing we have to change for that is running our desktop tests as 64-bit by default. For the life of me I cannot figure out how to change that from 32-bit. I gave up after a couple hours.

"The issue was about not using CYDRAG, not CYFRAME.

According to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getsystemmetrics CYDRAG is:
> The number of pixels above and below a mouse-down point that the mouse pointer can move before a drag operation begins. This allows the user to click and release the mouse button easily without unintentionally starting a drag operation. If this value is negative, it is subtracted from above the mouse-down point and added below it. 

I think CYDRAG was the wrong metric. It has nothing to do with the window frame. What we want is probably CYSIZEFRAME (at least according to the doc):
>The thickness of the sizing border around the perimeter of a window that can be resized, in pixels. SM_CXSIZEFRAME is the width of the horizontal border, and SM_CYSIZEFRAME is the height of the vertical border. 
This value is the same as SM_CYFRAME.

CYSIZEFRAME is the same as CYFRAME. Maybe I should change CYFRAME to CYSIZEFRAME for more clarity?

We've started a DCS sequence, and got into the pass-through state. We receive one escape, which could be the start of an ST, but it's then followed by a second escape. At that point we're clearly aborting the DCS, but what happens next?

Going by the state diagram, I'd expect an escape to start an escape sequence from anywhere, so that second escape is just the start of a CSI which sets the background color to red (and that's what XTerm does). For that to work we can't include `DcsTermination` here."

Im happy to do your job (coding correct  Xamarin fixes) as soon as Microsoft is paying me for that.

At the moment I think it’s sufficient (for me) that I give you an adequate example (which even other developers were able to adopt).
And that you, who gets payed by MS with the significant of money people are paying for VS subscriptions are providing professional fixes.

But apparently I’m wrong with my assumption, as everybody can see at the desolate quality of Xamarin forms.

"Lookup via `GlobalizationResolveDllImport` should be conditional on `strcmp(new_scope, ""libSystem.Globalization.Native"")`, otherwise there is a chance of matching a method from a wrong lib if it happens to have the same name as one in Globalization. It is highly unlikely though.

Folding the `GlobalizationResolveDllImport` lookup into handling of `QCall` does not seem right though, especially since there are further plans for QCall code. 

I think I will just add the following:

```c
#if defined(ENABLE_NETCORE) && !defined(NO_GLOBALIZATION_SHIM)
	if (strcmp(new_scope, ""libSystem.Globalization.Native"") == 0) {
		const void* method_impl = GlobalizationResolveDllImport(new_import);

"To restate: this is an IDE cache we're adding into the compiler layer. The IDE has no direct, or even indirect, control over the lifetime or semantics of it. From a conceptual level that feels wrong. All the bugs here (cache too big, elements live too long, etc ...) will be IDE bugs and we'll end up fixing everything in the compiler. 

That is why my mind went back to the semantic model provider solution. It's putting the control, the policy, etc ... for an IDE cache in the hands of the IDE team. 

I'm not 100% set on this on a path forward but my feelings around compiler dictating IDE caches keep coming up. "

What we have here is a fix for the build failure, but the fix *appears to me* to only be solving the *symptoms*.

The underlying condition doesn't make sense to me.

[This comment](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/5477#issuecomment-756787120) suggests that the ""problem"" is that if `@(AndroidJavaLibrary)` contains an entry that contains `..\`, then the referenced file is *skipped*

> ```
> AndroidJavaLibraries
>     C:\Users\user\.nuget\packages\xamarin.androidx.annotation\1.1.0.8\buildTransitive\monoandroid90\..\..\jar\androidx.annotation.annotation.jar
> …
> ```

This is *bananas*.  *Even if true*, the inability to use `..\` to pull in associated resources is *wrong*, particularly in a world of multi-targeting!  Do we *want* to have a separate copy of `androidx.annotation.annotation.jar` *per Target Framework Moniker within the NuGet package*?  (No!)

Plus, I don't personally understand *how* it could be true: the `<CreateManagedLibraryResourceArchive/>` *copies* the contents of `@(AndroidJavaLibrary)` into `OutputDirectory`:

https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/597e7169b069eff781d8f29ddb7746b719d7f781/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Tasks/CreateManagedLibraryResourceArchive.cs#L93-L95

…except now I see how it *can* be true: line 95 has a [`Path.Combine()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.path.combine?view=net-5.0#System_IO_Path_Combine_System_String_System_String_), which returns the *second parameter* if the second parameter is an absolute path.

In this case we *know* that the second parameter will be an absolute path, meaning line 95 is equivalent to:

```csharp
MonoAndroidHelper.CopyIfChanged (item.ItemSpec, item.ItemSpec);
```

which is a no-op; the file isn't copied.

Because the `@(AndroidJavaLibrary)` files are never copied into `OutputDirectory`, no files are added to `__AndroidLibraryProjects.__.zip`, and because no files are added, we get the MSB3375."
"Because the `ConvertFromInvariantString` method doesn't allow a `null` Type to be passed in, so it was wrong.

`GetConverter` calls `GetDescriptor` and `GetDescriptor` throws if `type` is null.

"I can see why we would want to avoid infinite loops.   However, I think using the original timeout may be the wrong approach, in particular if the timeout is zero.   Any failure to acquire the guard is likely spurious (in particular as the same guard file is shared across multiple locks), so we should not give up on the first try.   What about just limiting the number of retries in LockGuard by some fixed constant (e.g. 100) instead?"

Long answer

* Apple's macro are often incomplete or incorrect (e.g. wrong version)
  * Some (not all) gets fixed in newer betas or the next Xcode...
* There are assumptions like
  * old (pre 9.0) iOS API are assumed to be available on tvOS 9 (first version) unless decorated otherwise
  * old (pre 13) iOS API are assumed to be available on MacCatalyst 13 (first version) ...
  * enums are not always decorated since they are not API (you can see which API uses them to know which attributes are needed)
* Intro (runtime) and xtro (build time) will spot many, but not all, errors
* over time you get to know the API/framework and can identify things that looks unusual (and add tests to confirm your gut feelings)"

Pretty much any time we add a new native component to the stack we get this wrong and see a bunch of feedback from customers around this, so it'd be good to consider removing the dependency.  I can dig up some pointers.

Even taking .NETCore out of the picture, It's an anti-pattern to have a NuGet package with a pre-requisite on a machine-wide install.  If possible that should be avoided.  

To be clear, I am fine with this change, but I think the ICU build should consider building in a way similar to the rest of .NETCore native binaries so as to not introduce new dependencies."
"I can't figure out what is wrong with fp-ts -- it fails on 3.8 and fails even when I go back to an fp-ts commit from Feb 4. I guess we weren't reporting this before somehow. 

The actual error seems like a straightforward failure in inference:

```ts
export function getOption<A>(arb: fc.Arbitrary<A>): fc.Arbitrary<Option<A>> {
  return fc.oneof(getNone(), getSome(arb))
}
```

In which `getNone(): fc.Arbitrary<Option<unknown>>` but the author desired it to be `getNone(): fc.Arbitrary<Option<A>>` to match the type of `getSome(arb): fc.Arbitrary<Option<A>>`. Adding an explicit type argument is a workaround: `getNone<A>()`.

@github you might be interested in this: the code in question is in test/property-test/Option.ts"
"I re-read #38162 and the preceding bugs. The core problem is that that `in`-narrowing is guaranteed to be wrong a lot in the most common use case (optional properties), regardless of whether it's in an intersection. Without `missing` in the type system, we're just choosing whether to be wrong-strict or wrong-permissive.

Switching between the two is (1) probably not possible or worthwhile because of backward compatibility (2) a separate issue from making the feature work with intersections. I think this PR is ready to go as-is."

On the other hand, the base class - derived class boundary turns out to be a super productive bug farm, I have been poring over the code for more than a week by now and I still cannot claim I exactly know what's happening in each situation, especially as there are multiple code paths involved for explicit / sequential / auto layouts for reference types vs. value types with side fun regarding the ARM32 offset bias. As I believe that ""usefulness"" of this fixup is basically preventively diagnostic (we detect upfront that we got it wrong), I tend to believe that the base field offset calculation does constitute a value worth validating (in the intra-bubble scenario) as getting that wrong indicates a potentially critical bug in our implementation."

"I did more testing on macOS and verified that it gets both: not enough entries and too many.

Because of the wrong estimation on count, we return fewer items than we should. It can get worse as we check provided buffer size agains lover number but then we iterate  through all returned items, possibly writing to random memory. 

Now, we also return too many items. The sysctl returns all UDP sockets even not binded and/or connected. 
I added simple check to weed that down. It is imprecise as there is really not ""listening"" state on UDP. 
But I tested the outcome and compared to `netstat` on both platforms and it looks reasonable.
Returning

```
  0.0.0.0:50902
  0.0.0.0:51333
  0.0.0.0:50678
  0.0.0.0:63608
  0.0.0.0:50378

"@github/ncl PTAL

The change boils down to adding a `lock` when:
- The values in `HeaderStoreItemInfo` are being parsed (so its fields are being modified)
- The values are read from `HeaderStoreItemInfo` (non-validated reads / copying to a new header collection).

---

Since a value entry can transition from being a `string` to a `HeaderStoreItemInfo`, and we're not locking at those sites, it is expected that a single raw value may end up being parsed multiple times.
Such parsing is idempotent, so this is transparent to the user.

The code also has to be careful when reading the value of a given entry.
For example, the following logic would be problematic:
```c#
if (entries[i].Value is HeaderStoreItemInfo)
{
    // ...
}
else
{
    DoSomething((string)entries[i].Value); // Wrong! The value may now be HeaderStoreItemInfo
}
```
and it should instead be something like
```c#
object value = entries[i].Value;
if (value is HeaderStoreItemInfo)
{
    // ...
}
else
{
    DoSomething((string)value);
}
```

I've looked through our current code to make sure this is the case, but it's possible future changes may accidentally break this. I've added a test that should catch most such mistakes, but there may be cases that aren't covered."
"I removed this from the regular MAUI template because:

1. I don't even see it used
2. It seems wrong anyway because the 'replaces' text below doesn't seem to make sense

If I've misunderstood this, I will happily add it back. (And also add it to the Blazor template.)"
"I made the two constructors internal because I'm not aware of a reason for them to be public. It's used across all the supported platforms via shared source.

If I'm wrong, I'm happy to change this back. However we've changed the parameter list several times now, so it suggests we'll keep changing it in the future, and maintaining back-compat if it's a public API could become very messy."
"Also to make the context for this more clear: This API is used to generate view transform information. All of the methods that call it are internal, and it's used by XAML Hot Reload. 

If the math is still wrong (which I don't _think_ it is) it shouldn't affect any users applications, since nothing MAUI specific actually touches this."
"My personal preference would be *not* to have this overload, and thus require people to specify the `selector` argument explicitly. Reasoning:

1. If people don't realise we are inferring a selector, they will get the wrong impression about how the DOM gets populated. They will probably think that `<app>` in their `Index.cshtml` is actually a usage of a Razor Component, since it is almost the same syntax.
2. Pretty soon we'll probably change `Index.cshtml` so that the `<app>` goes inside some kind of container, or maybe `<app>` remains as the container but we change the name of the root component from `App` to `Root` or something. This is going to be needed so that `<app>` remains in the output so we know where to inject the client-rendered content to replace the server-prerendered content. At this point, you'd have to specify `selector` anyway and the existence of the other overload would primarily just be a way of getting confused.

@github If you feel strongly about keeping the overload without `selector`, then so be it, but my preference would be to drop it."
This logic *could* be moved to ValidateRequest but it felt wrong to do it there. I'm fine either way..
Is there any way this could be determined automatically based on the rendermode on the `<component>` tag? Would be nice if we could avoid the risk of customers picking the wrong option and getting confused.
"I was wrong about this instance being shared, but I've found a few more shared that I'll flag."
We could go crazy here and make figure out the suggestion based on the context (you could even do a codefix).
"A reasonable suggestion given that's what we did before.

But, the intent can be made more obvious by excluding all of `$(RuntimeTransportReferenceDirectory)*.dll` instead of the `@(_ReferencedRuntimeRefAssemblies)` subset. The double-exclusion just looks wrong and that's why I wanted to remove it. Will try my approach and fall back to your suggestion if that fails."
"StatusCodePagesFeature is a public class, so if we were to change it, we'd have to make it continue to work as it does today when called with the empty constructor. I think it might be worthwhile to just use a new internal IStatusCodePagesFeature that lazily reads the endpoint.

The only thing I don't like is locking in the wrong value for Enabled if the property is read before UseRouting(). You could definitely argue it's no worse than today where it's locked in immediately when the feature is added, but that feels a little less surprising. I wonder if it'd be better to avoid negative caching unless the property is explicitly set, but maybe that's even more surprising."
"The codefix updates the shipping file as intended. For some reason our team insists it is wrong thing to do: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/31076#discussion_r598208196 even those these files exist solely for the benefit of the tool. 🤷🏽 "

This feels very wrong, Tuple members are cached and we should not be creating duplicates, especially that we might get this wrong here, or some changes to tuple implementation will have to be now made in multiple places.

This translation is wrong. It mentions type of the field rather than field in a type. Very misleading.

"I wouldn't do the ""first one that works"", since that arguably requires an N*M matching to find sanity.

Any of

* First with any known key label (will then fail if the wrong algorithm's algorithm-specific key is first)
* Only key with any known key label (fail if there's a second one of any kind)
* First applicable
* Only applicable

seem fine to me.  So really it's just ""for keys alone it was only-applicable, for cert+key it's first-applicable/first-applicable"".

Since the X509Certificate2 ctor will load the first applicable thing out of a multi-PEM, first-applicable/first-applicable might make more sense here in these classes... I'm just making sure it's something we thought about instead of something we just ended up with."
"And it could totally be wrong... Not sure. CC @github "
"Yes, this is incorrectly assigning the wrong constant value number.  I found similar code 
It was occasionally happening in the framework dlls and the the beq_r8 test cases.
Our code has two chances to fold the expression, the first one will fold compares with two constant arguments,
which is the common case.  If that doesn't fold then it tries folding using the value numbers and that path was wrong and caused the beq_r8 tests to fail with my CSE changes.

"I decided to change these to more direct state modifications because event assignment is more limited in what it can operate on. For example the LHS of an event assignment must be an lvalue, so it can't be a conditional-access expression like `x?.y += SomeDelegate`.

If this feels wrong from a coding patterns POV we can change this to use the LearnFromNullTest/LearnFromNonNullTest or some other more appropriate helpers that I may have overlooked in NullableWalker."
"The problem with #25570 was the removal of all the other fonts, caused by [Chromium bug 724393](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=724393) which is marked as wontfix. That's why I kept the old font stack after `system-ui` — it was cited as the fix for that issue in #26912.

I'm fine with limiting this change to Linux since that's where it affects me, but it's nice to be consistent across platforms in case someone wants to change the system font on another OS. Even without a custom system font, using `system-ui` on Windows helps fix the wrong font being used for Latin characters if the language is set to Chinese, as I demonstrated above.

I suspect there are probably similar cases of this fixing incorrect fonts with other languages and possibly even on macOS, though I haven't tested that."
"Hmm, I'm somewhat confused here - you're disabling the test on x86 yet you changed the <code>Size</code> of the <code>StructLayout</code> attribute on <code>ExplicitlySizedStructAuto</code> - does that mean that the previous value was wrong or is the change from 0x14 to 0x18 supposed to be more stressful? I don't think it's a big deal, it just comes as a surprise why you need to modify a test you're disabling for the ""new x86 scenario"" you're adding."
"the construction of this sentence will be wrong in most languages.

There is no general sentence structure that can support ""Move focus left"" and ""Move focus previous"" at the same time. Especially not in another language, right?

This is different from how we handled other commands, where we said (something like) `Move focus: direction=previous`. That looks like a straight parameter substitution.

This is different . . . it needs its own complete command string, ""Move focus to last-used pane"" or something."
"> not sure whether it is going to work for proc file system.

This is a good point. I just realized that during ""reading the stream and counting the length, allocating, then re-reading from pos:0"" the data might get overwritten by the OS and we may end up with wrong size. If that is the case, in order to avoid it, we would still need to maintain the loop-until structure. I am not sure if /proc/[pid]/* files can be read atomically, but with current implementation the risk seems to be lower."

"this might be dumb, but maybe we should have some sort of typedef / alias for `size_t` here, to make it clear that these are `CommandId`s or something?"
"So the previous comment (which you actually reviewed iirc :P) was wrong? That's fine. I just don't think a name like `IsRootBuffer` is meaningful to intent. Instead it just tells me what the line of code is, and acts like a needless comment. The intent of the code was to check that we weren't performing these actions on the interactive window. Again, is there a better way to check that we're in the interactive window? "

"Correct me if I am wrong regarding why the check for `!isValidVectorIndex` is needed. 
If we are past the importer phase (where the JIT checks for validity of `indexOp` and `inde
xOp` was not const at that time) but later it became constant (say after constant propagation) we will still generate code for checking the value of `indexOp` validity during running time and presumably this should abort the execution if the value was out of range."

"> Adding test SemanticModelOnReceiver (looks good)

I debugged through the test. It looks to me that we definitely need to follow up on this. Since nothing appears to be obviously broken, a separate PR should be fine. Here is what is going wrong. As I suspected, we do not cache node for the receiver when we bind statement containing the element access. Therefore, we don't find a bound node for it on the first attempt. So we bind the containing statement again and still don't find the corresponding bound node in the map. Then we go into an error recovery mode and bind the receiver on its own. Besides utilizing the error recovery mode, we end up with a map that is inconsistent. For the containing element access we have a bound node that uses different node for the receiver. That is likely to create problems, if not today, then in the future.   "
Coding style is wrong in this function.
"That tools looks pretty amazing!

Its mere existence makes me vote towards having the templates use our own coding style (in which case the coding style is wrong in some of the new files - I guess you could run `dotnet format` locally in the template directory and that'll fix it 😄 )

"What do you think about returning `string?` here and adding `!` in the callers where we know it's going to be non-null?   It feels wrong to say we never return NULL here when it's actually pretty common for CodeBase to be null on wasm, for example."
"This change doesn't feel right. The bound node is associated with a particular syntax, that syntax should be used to cache the node. If the node is associated with wrong syntax, it would be better to change binding to use the right syntax for the node.

"I see that this is a pattern copied from ILLink so I don't expect it to be fixed here, but I'm not a big fan of code handling impossible states. They tend to hide bugs and make root causing bugs a lot harder.

Two things here:
* We ""handle"" situation when `Nullable<T>` doesn't have exactly one generic argument.
* We ""handle"" when the instantiation argument is something bogus (null) - by unnecessarily using a non-exhaustive switch instead of a simple if/else.

I see this pattern in many places so I'm not going to comment on them, but it's something worth re-evaluating in the linker repo. Code that crashes when it hits invalid state is a lot easier to work with than code that papers over it and then crashes later (or worse - produces invalid outputs). We have zero test coverage for this invalid state handling.

A lot of the invalid state handling (not this one in particular) also seems to be forced by nullable reference types - I assume it wasn't easy to make something non-null so now we have code handling an impossible null scenario. Honesly, I would prefer hitting a NullReferenceException. Those exceptions are super easy to debug and often can be debugged from nothing but a stack trace. Complex code taking wrong turns is everything but easy to debug.

In the maxim ""if I can't cover a branch in testing, the branch shouldn't exist"". The null propagating operator `?.` is a branch too. We use them very liberally in this codebase. Many of those uses look as questionable as the question mark."
Seems like the tests are in the wrong file? This is not testing `DefaultJsonTypeInfoResolver`.
"I sort of misspoke, it'd still be in the function you just edited because that's the one that's checking a class declaration, it's just that you need to check for other wrong parent node types. Or, the other way around in that maybe the fix is to error if the parent is not a block or something."

"This question is apparently relevant to the OOMing test, because apparently variance probing in _one_ direction was working, because there were no baseline changes and no OOMing when I restricted my change to _both_ directions being unmeasurable. But, it feels like that must mean our analysis of the assignability in that test is either wrong, or only coincidentally right. Because what the current state of my PR is showing us is that at least one direction of variance probing on these types is inconclusive, but we’ve previously believed we know what the variance is, and were using that instead of structural comparisons to decide the assignability of `List<T>` to `List<U>`. That _must_ mean we have a bug, right? (Well, we obviously do because it’s mentioned in [varianceMeasurements.errors.txt](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/45578/files/8194a58d5064a451f6634836cf161668c33cd38d#diff-05d57eee4d438086a29ea51e2d54ce88839536d53e66e9ded8e3edc80e4a0004)—I assume that’s the bug I’m describing)."

Both of those still contain references to a generic `K` and maybe this is not what we want here or maybe this creates more work further down the road. So perhaps we should use a completely concrete source in this check (`'*'` in this case).

Apart from that this PR at the moment is causing 2 baselines changes:

A good news is that there are no new errors created by this PR and there are no errors that disappeared. The bad news is that those 2 specific case (which look very similar, so perhaps this is a actually a single case) have longer errors reported. I have a hard time assessing if that's a good change or not - would love to hear out your thoughts about this.

"Thanks @github 

I've merge `master` into this PR so that I could build/test locally. Resolved some conflicts with use-site diagnostics changes. The commit before the merge is https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/26337/commits/bd63fafab7893576c95c96419bd2d7645730cbe8 (in case something goes wrong and we need to reset in some way).
I've added a commit with tests for scenarios I still had questions about (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/8512954b3c884b91313b2c214fdbfa112fdc62d9).
Things look good.

The PR is not in a reviewable state until the feature branch is refresh (ie. https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/51424 is merged).

Crazy thought... could it be possible that the test expects the user to be vsagent? The new pools use **cloudtest** and the error says `No User exists for cloudtest`
"@github, it's precisely the file/dir distinction that prevented me from rolling out `existsSync` more broadly.  It's possible we can add try-catches for the rare cases where the wrong type is found, but it seemed likely to be a pervasive change.

As an alternative, I've proposed a change to node itself: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/33716"
"Main's corelib is 9.63 Mb (R2R'd)

- `ExtendedDefaultPolicy` without taking PGO into account: 9.83 Mb
- `ExtendedDefaultPolicy` with PGO `JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=10`: 10.10 Mb
- `ExtendedDefaultPolicy` with PGO `JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=0`: 10.17 Mb

`JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=10` means we're fine that inliner won't inline anything in cold blocks (call-sites with real profiles)
`JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=0` means it doesn't affect the BenefitMultiplier anyhow for cold blocks (so we still can inline calls in them). By default, I use `5` as a balance.

Here is the jit-diff (PMI mode) without taking PGO into account: https://gist.github.com/EgorBo/8e44063324ec21ba29c636a79d7e871c

### Improvements
Most of the size improvements come from ""don't inline anything in BBJ_THROW blocks"", e.g.:
```csharp
if (x == null)
    throw new ArgumentNullException(SR.InvalidArgument); // get_InvalidArgument() is inlined here
```
both `ArgumentNullException.ctor` and `get_InvalidArgument` aren't inlined anymore. A good example is  `LowLevelLifoSemaphore:ReleaseCore(int):this` diff: https://www.diffchecker.com/Wlfl2Lde
***
There are some interesting examples where inlining leads to smaller size, e.g. 
```csharp
static GCHandle Test(object? value) => GCHandle.Alloc(value);
```
Diff: https://www.diffchecker.com/kCYnyUge
^ Inliner managed to detect foldable branches in the `GCHandle`'s constructor and inlined it, see [here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/fc4a42746d9cf65ad3db4074207069ab9c168bc9/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/InteropServices/GCHandle.cs#L62) and its [ctor](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/fc4a42746d9cf65ad3db4074207069ab9c168bc9/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/InteropServices/GCHandle.cs#L32-L54).
***
Another example - it's now able to inline `string.Equals` when we compare literals, e.g. `if (strArg.Length == 0)` is recognized as a foldable branch due to the fact we can now recognize 'get_Length' call, example:
```csharp
bool foo(string str) => str == ""hello"";

bool test() => foo(""hello"");
```
Diff for `test`: https://www.diffchecker.com/vPVxpDl1
***
There are some diffs due to PMI trying to instantiate `Vector<T>` with unsupported T (e.g. char) and inliner helpes here too, e.g. https://www.diffchecker.com/ElRZpnyh
***
`GC:AllocateArray(int,bool):ref` is smaller after inlining: https://www.diffchecker.com/AZKH3aiG
***
Same for `ASCIIUtility:NarrowUtf16ToAscii(long,long,long):long`: https://www.diffchecker.com/yS7ttpfS
***

***

***
Misc: https://www.diffchecker.com/olDdSxqM, https://www.diffchecker.com/XddHJSrd, https://www.diffchecker.com/3I81EWAo
***
There are cases where ExtendedDefaultPolicy doesn't inline what was inlined by the previous inliner - I tried to avoid it, but there were cases where I'm not sure we should inline, e.g this call https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/Directory.cs#L63 is inlined despite being quite complex: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/Common/src/System/IO/FileSystem.Attributes.Windows.cs#L25-L35
Old inliner detected here ""arg feeds const test"" and added a big multiplier. It did so because IL scan was not quite accurate and had many false positives. However, this method will still be inlined with PGO (and I am sure we have one for this in the static profile we ship). **UPD** I slightly added some boost in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/52708/commits/05a19e57d879bf9ba9d271a7bfb8efeb2b97c58c.

## Size regressions
These are the cases where inlining increases the size but hopefully for better performance.
```
        2846 (357.54% of base) : System.Private.CoreLib.dasm - Array:Sort(Array,Array,int,int,IComparer)
```
InlineTree diff: https://www.diffchecker.com/nEAcbTWc It decided to inline `ArraySortHelper.IntrospectiveSort` here (e.g. because of ""non-generic code calls generic"").
***
```
1483 (131.71% of base) : System.Private.CoreLib.dasm - Guid:TryFormat(Span`1,byref,ReadOnlySpan`1):bool:this
```
Diff https://www.diffchecker.com/KgWTWBug - it inlined all `HexToChars` calls.
***
```

Overall I don't see anything terribly wrong so far (e.g. terrible spills because of too-many-locals), I spent the whole week on fixing the regressions and now it's more or less fine.
Performance benefits aren't as good as they used to be with a way more aggressive inliner but I'm going to investigate what exactly led to such improvements and send separate PRs. At least currently I don't see any impact on ""time to first request"", I'll publish the first results once my [script](https://gist.github.com/EgorBo/a1ab453bf41a5369aa54b4c4fba6bea5) finishes.

@github you can pick any method from the jit-diff and I'll explain with the diffs what exactly happened."

"I think a lot of the recent and upcoming C# language features get one fundamental thing wrong (in my personal opinion).

@github has shown a great number of examples throughout this conversation how `!!` substantically improves writing certain fragments of code, but in all those cases I found that it was *much harder* to read and grok that code afterwards.

Writing a few extra lines of if statements is not that hard and especially in .NET it's a minuscule problem given that  most IDEs already write it for me at the tip of a few key strokes followed by a double `TAB` stroke.

I would encourage developers at Microsoft to ask themselves how open they actually are to community feedback like this. I don't mean to suggest anything bad, but personally I often get the feeling that by the time a feature like this gets revealed for feedback a lot of investment (time and emotion) has already gone into developing a (more or less polished) prototype of it at which point people already have a personal investment in defending their decisions and have a bias towards downplaying good counter arguments as ""minority noise""."

I think there is nothing wrong with random, the point was that we needed to differentiate between Illumos and other unixes we already support as its RAND_MAX is set to 0x7fff and it doesn't apply to the random() output (it does for rand() only). And since the arcrandom has a function that doesn't have to care about the RAND_MAX, it seemed like a clean replacement.

Hmmm yea that's annoying. Figuring out what will and won't work across platforms with brushes has been a fun journey.
 
I took a brief stab at figuring out how to let users supply custom UIViews for UITabs because iOS really locks this down and I found that you can do something like this inside `ShellItemRenderer`

```C#
CustomTabBar _customTabBar;
		public override void ViewDidLoad()
		{
			base.ViewDidLoad();

			_customTabBar = new CustomTabBar();
			this.SetValueForKey(_customTabBar, new NSString(""tabBar""));
```

```C#
		class CustomTabBar : UITabBar
		{

		}
```

And then iOS will render your `CustomTabBar`
I don't know if this helps you at all but I was pretty excited when I found these hooks

> The current implementation limits it to class types that have a `size()` method. IMO it should work for most to all types that support the subscript operator, such like random-access iterators, C-arrays, and pointers. We should accept signed index types because iterators and pointers support negative offsets. And we should avoid to cast the passed index to `ptrdiff_t` or `size_t` because the expected type size might be smaller. E.g. `winrt::hstring::size_type` is always `uin32_t`.

Please note that Chromium and Firefox don't have a solution.

Chromium [doesn't do it correctly either](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=950362). It just ""ignores"" the ""Title bars and window borders"" setting for the top border so it always paint the border with the accent color. And in that case, there is no transparency (I think) so that is correct but it shouldn't paint the border with the accent color in the first place:

"> I think I realize now, that making `VTInt` a signed integer might've been a mistake...

Why's that? I actually thought a signed int was the right choice. As an example, if you're working with VT coordinates, a typical calculation would be to add or subtract an offset, and then clamp the result within the active margins or buffer range. If that intermediate offset goes negative on a signed int that's not a problem - it's still going to clamp correctly. But if it's unsigned, it's going to wrap, and you're going to end up with the wrong result.

> If we need these two new color functions to be performant, we could use a LUT for mapping 0-100 to 0-255.

I like that idea. I am keen to get these functions as fast as possible, mostly for when they're used in sixel. Although HLS colors aren't likely to be used much, so the HLS one is less critical.

> That wouldn't just work for `ColorFromRGB100` but also for `ColorFromHLS` which can be written with integer arithmetic only (without integer division).

I've done some initial experiments with a LUT, and it's a big improvement for `ColorFromRGB100`, but in `ColorFromHLS` it actually seems somewhat slower. It could just my badly written code, but I went with the floating point implementation in the first place because I found it faster than my integer version, and I suspect the LUT doesn't make up for that loss.

I'll play around some more and see if I can improve things, otherwise I'll just do the LUT for `ColorFromRGB100`."

"> it sounds like you want to loosen the restriction in place:

I guess so. Since you can replicate those situations in cases where we do not issue an error (eg, via variadic concatenation), I think having accurate behavior for them is important. And thus, once you have accurate behavior for those situations, there's not much of a justification in forbidding them in normal circumstances, I think.


> How often do we leverage the distinction between optional and potentially undefined when we have the property itself?

Infrequently. In fact, that we don't is pretty much one of the reasons for https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/41418 being a bug and not ""intended behavior"". So the inclusion of `undefined` in the type is potentially needed for consistency.

> For multiple rest elements...

Yeah, I just reason that sequences of types in an array aren't that different from sequences of characters (or types) in a string (or template) - so the later being strictly more powerful with respect to what is preserved through concatenation operations rubs me the wrong way a bit - I feel like we've done some of the thinking on how to match up these sequences, and should probably try to do the same here, rather than quietly losing type fidelity in an unsafe way."

    Fixes: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/44559

The reason why the tests were failing was kind of tricky. 

- We set, disable implicit references, which means Microsoft.NETCore.App is not a reference when restore happens.
- Because of that, the AppHost package is not downloaded at all, however when we targeted net5.0 for the tests, the AppHost package was found on the SDK packs directory. Now that NetCoreAppCurrent moved to net6.0, it does add the AppHost package to `PackageDownload` but it never downloads it because there are no FrameworkReferences when ProcessFrameworkReferences is executed. 
- The fix was to move `FrameworkReference` out of the target so that the framework reference is picked up by restore and the runtime packs are downloaded correctly.
- Also I removed the `RuntimePack` from `PackageDownload` to not download un necessary stuff.

I validated that we still build and publish using the local built runtime and ref packs:

I also did some cleanup to use the `MicrosoftNETCoreAppVersion` property instead of hardcoding the version in the `KnownFrameworkReference` and `KnownAppHostPack`.

When trying to run an individual project I noticed that the way we were invoking `dotnet` was wrong because we were using `DotNetRoot` which is empty if arcade is using the globally installed SDK so we were resolving `TestDotNetPath` to the test project path... I changed it to use `DotNetTool` which is handled by arcade: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/4873d157a8f34f8cc7e28b3f9938b32c642ef542/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk/tools/RepoLayout.props#L35

"> I disabled hill climbing.

What about `DOTNET_SYSTEM_NET_SOCKETS_INLINE_COMPLETIONS`? Was it set to `1`? 

For some reason it's now the default setting for PlaintextPlatform and JsonPlatform benchmarks (I believe that it's wrong, we then have 1 epoll thread per core, not 1 per 30 cores which is the default setting that 99.9999% of our customers are using in production)). 

It can have a big impact on the benchmark results when you are changing somethinng related to `ThreadPool`. I would just feel safer about any changes if they were benchmarked with the default settings (with the exception of hill climbing on machines with many cores).

> There is a work item for fixing it in .NET 6

I am really happy to hear that! Is there a GH issue that I could follow or for now it's just somewhere in our internal docs?"
"Looks like this will not be as simple as just adding a new task that runs a .cmd instead of a .sh. The tests now failed because it was trying to pass parameters to a script with the wrong syntax.

"> I have presented a patch that allowed me to parse an entire Windows Runtime API surface with a high-level API. 

The point of this discussion is whether we are comfortable with supporting this scenario going forward. WinRT is developed independently on .NET these days.  System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext was not designed for reading .winmd files. There are scenarios today where System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext won't work well for reading .winmd files, and this set is likely to grow over time.

> It also reduces code complexity by reusing existing code and dropping generic parameter 

This simplification is definitely welcomed. Thank you!

>  I'd be interested to read about the differences between .NET type system and WinRT type system

I am not aware of comprehensive up-to-date document that lists all differences. I can give you one example: Names in assembly references are irrelevant in WinRT type system. The name in .winmd assembly references maps to correct file name some of the time. It is fragile to depend on it. The WinRT type system specifies [algorithm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/winrt-cref/winmd-files#winmd-file-name) for locating .winmd files. The runtime built-in WinRT interop support had methods like `AppDomain.TypeResolve` to support the WinRT specific algorithm for locating .winmd files. None of this support is present in System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext.

Also, I was wrong that `System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext` does not apply type projections. It does apply the type projections since `MetadataReaderOptions.Default = MetadataReaderOptions.ApplyWindowsRuntimeProjections`. However, this is the frozen snapshot of the type projections that matches the runtime built-in WinRT interop support. The set of WinRT type projections was extended since then, and so this won't work well for more recent WinRT types such like the ones that come with WinUI 3."

When creating any culture, we read the culture data from the underlying OS library (either NLS or ICU). Part of the data we read is the culture native digits. We should get ten digits string (e.g. `0123456789`). Sometime the settings in the host machine get messed up and can return digits strings less than ten digits and that can cause .NET to throw `IndexOutOfRangeException`. Such failure is hard to diagnose after the fact especially when the collected dumps don't include the machine settings. This issue gets reported every while and recently we get it again from some customer. The change here is only read the returned digits data if it is ten digits. Otherwise, we'll fallback to ASCII digits 

It is hard to add a test for such fix as it will need to change the machine settings. But, I have tested manually and ensured it address the issue when having wrong settings.

The symbols for `dotnet` and `hostpolicy` are not being published to the public Microsoft symbol servers.

It looks like we are currently relying on the symbol packages for `Microsoft.NETCore.DotNetHost` and `Microsoft.NETCore.DotNetHostPolicy` to get symbols for `dotnet` and `hostpolicy` published.

The `pkgproj` projects in installer have a `PackageReference` to `Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Packaging`: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/f7b441d6c14cfc60c2d02bdc6a087247806efb7c/src/installer/pkg/projects/Directory.Build.props#L129

That package includes a target that sets the `SymbolPackageOutputPath` based on the `PackageOutputPath`.
https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Packaging/src/build/Packaging.targets#L63

However, the targets of that package are imported _before_ the project's `Directory.Build.targets`, which imports Arcade targets that set the default for `PackageOutputPath`:
https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk/tools/ProjectDefaults.targets#L22

As a result, the symbol packages built by `src/installer/pkg/projects/*.pkgproj` end up in the wrong directory - For example, under `artifacts\bin\<project_name>\Release` instead of `artifacts\packages\Release\Shipping` - such that they do not get uploaded and published.

This was an unfortunate side effect of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/57036.

This change goes back to having `SymbolPackageOutputPath` explicitly set. It is not really intuitive / great, but given the desire to stop having these packages (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35244, which will also need to make sure symbol publishing is covered by other things) and my expectation that we should backport to 6.0, I went with the simply bringing back the previous behaviour.

When enabling the globalization invariant mode on Linux, we'll always fallback to `UTC` time zone which is wrong and a regression from .NET 5.0. We have some docker containers which enable the globalization invariant mode by default on the whole image; the problem will be obvious there.

In .NET 6.0 we have introduced the [Globalization Invariant Mode Breaking Change](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/globalization/6.0/culture-creation-invariant-mode). This breaking change causes throwing exception when enabling the globalization invariant mode and creating any culture other than Invariant culture. 
If the globalization invariant mode is enabled and trying to get the local time zone when running on Linux platform, the creation process will try to initialize the display names of the time zone. This initialization tries to reset the UI culture to `en-US` if it is set to Invariant culture. When we have the globalization invariant mode is on, the UI culture will always be Invariant and cause the time zone initialization to fallback to `en-US` which will throw exception because it is not allowed to create any other cultures in the Invariant mode. We catch the exception and then fallback to use `UTC` time zone instead of the actual time zone set on the running machine.

The fix is simple and not risky which is avoid creating any culture during time zone initialization when the globalization invariant mode is on.

"If these types required the option type to be specified to construct, I can see the value in having these. Requiring the caller to get the path to the temp directory from an option type before passing it in to these types seems onerous to the caller and super easy to get wrong.

"@github is rightfully concerned about us doing Razor language changes and then losing the ability to immediately verify the tooling impact of those changes. I'm not saying that it will be impossible to validate the language changes, just much, much harder than today 😄. So that being said I 100% agree with Ryan that it sucks to have that restriction.

Basically i'm juggling the following priorities in my head:
1. Optimize build times for the dotnet org
2. Optimize the manual labor of ""another repo""
3. Optimize stability for tooling specific changes (flakiness will heavily disrupt our ability to get out VS insertions)
4. Optimize speed for tooling specific changes. Re-building all of aspnetcore would not allow tooling to iterate quickly.
5. Optimize Razor language changes that also impact tooling.
6. Optimize Razor tooling only changes that do not require language changes.

As of right now we have a TON of 6 on the critical path as committed/currently being done. Hell that's a large reason why the aspnetcore/aspnetcore-tooling merge was delayed to begin with. And it goes without saying that 3 & 4 impact both language and non-language changes. Sooo all that said i'm willing to iteratively bring pieces of the aspnetcore-tooling world into AspNetCore to make the grander dotnet world better with the realization that there's pros and cons to it all. 

In an ideal world we'd ""just"" solve all of the above priorities. I haven't found a way to inexpensively do that and everything else we have planned"

Are you asking me to transcribe the CLR access rules? The only ""variable"" is how we define type and assembly identity. Assembly identity is supposed to be defined by` IAssemblySymbol.Identity` but @github points out that the compiler does it wrong. Type identity should be defined, recursively, by name and arity, and containing symbol. The rest is down to the CLR rules for the meaning of the access modes.

"> for enter case, last token won't be the ""}""

Yes.  But you also check for EOF.  Which i assume you can get after enter.  (If i'm wrong, def let me know... i'm really trying to understand the code, and as i've mentioned, it's not clear ot me).  

Regardless, this whole discussion is helping prove my case :)   This is complex and subtle and it is *not* clear just from looking how this is intended to work.  There are many callers for many user interaction codepaths, and there are many checks going on.  The fact that after going back and forth with you a *dozen* times, it's *still* not clear to my why this is correct, is a strong indication to me that we shoudl *make this code more clear*.

I think it would be reasonable to just nip this entire back-and-forth in the bud and just spend any energy that would have been put into a response here into just putting that effort into clarifying that code :)

At the end of the day, the best you'll be able to do is finally convince me that that code is correct.  And once that happens, we'll still just want to comment the code to help others understand.  After all, if i've spent dozens of minutes on this, and i still don't get it, i'm not sure how this will be for others who are even *less* familiar with formatting than i am.

`shutdownCode` might give users the wrong idea (thinking relation to `Socket.Shutdown`) -- QUIC spec calls it `errorCode` even when successful (`NO_ERROR`) so maybe that.
"note: this split was intentional to help make it totally clear that this cancellation token was what you shoudl use in this operation and you shouldn't accidentally capture it.

the problem with FixAllContext was that some people ended up capturing it and using the wrong cancellation token later.  i think we should undo this change (or pull it into a separate PR where we can assess it)."
"I don't like pushing it down, except for helpers that are dedicated argument validation helpers for mutliple reasons:

1) It's not clear whether a public API is actually validating all of its arguments if it leaves it up to the methods it calls to do so.
2) When writing an internal method, how do I decide whether or not to do full argument validation? It's inconsistent and confusing if some internal methods of a type do argument validation because they happen to be called from some public API impl, but others don't because they currently aren't called from public API impl. 
3) The methods called from the public API implementation might have different argument names than the public API. They might also have more or less arguments than the public API. Throwing an argument exception with wrong argument name is not very user friendly - it defeats the purpose of having argument name on the exception.
4) Internal calls to the internal methods would do redundant argument validation.

The caller might expect a call to `KeepAlive` to behave _at minimum_ like a call to `GC.KeepAlive`. Since no `ObjectReader` is ever created by this stream, only the minimum keep alive support is required. This is already documented on the property, and is the reason why the delegate was abstracted to a property.

Yeah, that matches the docs: ""Returns the number of bits in the minimal two's-complement representation of this BigInteger, excluding a sign bit."".

I think it's something like

```
int bitLen = bigInt.bitLength();
return (bitLen + 7) / 8;
```

(Might be wrong for negative numbers if it really ""excludes"" the sign bit, vs excludes the cleared sign bit for positive numbers... then `if (bigInt.signum() < 0) { bitLen++; }`)

My expectation from the docs is that positive 0xFF will report signum() as 1 and bitLength() as 8, but export in two bytes.

(8 + 7) / 8 == 15 / 8 == 1

The extractor wouldn't need to change.  This just detects the same thing without going through array export."

"I think - please forgive me if I'm wrong - you are confusing two methods here:

1. `private static void ProcessAttributes(XmlReader reader, XmlConfigurationElement element)`
2. `void ProcessElementAttributes(Prefix prefix, XmlConfigurationElement element)`

The first method is invoked during the parsing stage. It reads the XML attributes from the XML document and adds instances of `XmlConfigurationElementAttributeValue` to the current `XmlConfigurationElement`

The second method is invoked during the processing stage. It produces configuration key values for each attribute.

To avoid future confusion, I have renamed `ProcessAttributes` (the first method) to `ReadAttributes`.

If I misunderstood you and it was not a matter of confusion, can you please clarify why you think that exception does not belong there?"
"The side effect is that `ReadString` advances the stream cursor. Or, put another way, your code is equivalent to the following:

```cs
context._savedLicenseKeys.Add(key: reader.ReadKey(), value: reader.ReadValue());

private static string ReadKey(this BinaryReader reader) => reader.ReadString();
private static string ReadValue(this BinaryReader reader) => reader.ReadString();
```

Which ostensibly should be equivalent to the following, because all I did was reorder the named parameters:

```cs
context._savedLicenseKeys.Add(value: reader.ReadValue(), key: reader.ReadKey());
```

However, that second example will result in the wrong entries being added to the underlying dictionary. The reason is that side effects are occuring within the underlying stream while the arguments to this method are being evaluated. Pulling the arguments out as temp variables before the method call makes the code read ""top-to-bottom"" instead of ""left-to-right"". This is generally easier for people to understand."

It is given a delegate creation to cache, That is all what it is supposed to do, validating the delegate creation is not its job.

"> What is wrong with the transforming? Did I implement the BlockReplacing wrong?

No, the transformation itself looks correct to me (well, there is one issue - `GTF_RELOP_JMP_USED` is not guaranteed to be maintained by this phase, so it'll have to be replaced by a check of the user's oper). It is just happening under conditions that are too lax. `LowerCompare` handles all sorts of relops, so this code will also optimize, e. g. `(x & 1) > 1` to `x & 1`, which is not correct.

There are a lot of options; `opts.MinOpts` in particular means that the compiler is not to perform (almost) any optimizations. You can see it checked in `opts.OptimizationEnable`.

"A couple notes:

1. The failing test case is a little weird after all; the globals only show up because of the cumulative parsing weirdness that comes from the several preceding lines. My impression looking at that test was that every line was intended to be a clean parsing context. It’s valuable to ensure that a half-written statement has good completions as you’re writing it, but less so that the fourth half-written statement in a row behaves well. I would actually just split that test file up into a file per line.

2. Having an `any` or undefined contextual type is a little too restrictive. You also want to account for `object`, `unknown`, and possibly string index signatures:

    ```ts
    declare function f1(obj: unknown): void;
    declare function f2(obj: object): void;
    declare function f3(obj: Record<string, any>): void;

    declare var foo;
    f1({ /**/ });
    f2({ /**/ });
    f3({ /**/ });
    ```

    But the index signature case brings up the question of whether the types need to match up:

    ```ts
    declare const foo: string;
    const obj: { [key: string]: number } = { /* `foo` here? It would error because string is not assignable to number */ };
    ```

    On one hand, we don’t do any kind of filtering of member completions in the presence of a contextual type, but that’s more justifiable because you might dot off of one and continue the expression, resulting in a different type. More practically, it’s going to be too expensive to check the assignability of every identifier in the completions list, so I think the choice is between offering all the completions, even wrong ones, or none.

    You also want to test cases where the contextual type is a type parameter:

    ```ts
    declare function foo<T>(obj: T): T; // and another where `T extends object`, maybe `T extends {}`
    var blah: string;
    foo({ /**/ })
    ```

    I think this might Just Work once you consider `unknown` and `object` contextual types, but it’s worth testing.

"I added the MSBuild task and targets to validate that the attribute and version is correct.

At first I thought about just doing a simple validation of `ExpectedVersion` == `InformationalVersion.Substring(0, IndexOf('+'))` and error if that was false in a simple MSBuild target, however, even if `InformationalVersion` property is correct, the attribute could be wrong, since a public API relies on the attribute being correct I decided to add a task that cracked open the assembly and inspected the attribute. Please let me know if you think it is overkill to add a task and I can revert it and do it in the simple MSBuild way that doesn't crack open the attribute.

Second, I started using System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext, however, since this is an MSBuild task, I was getting:
```

The only way to do that was to publish instead of build the installer tasks, and that would've been more complicated since you need to specify the core library path and assembly search paths, so if we want to enable this on other projects in the future it would involve more logic. So I decided to go with MetadataReader since you don't need to load any dependencies and you can just get the info needed from there.

Let me know if you have any objections or suggestions.

I validated by removing my fix and I got an error as expected:

"@github Investigating this a bit more, is there a way to avoid using TickCount/TickCount64?
The reason is that this information is not available in a minidump. DateTime.Now is available (the time the dump was written), but not TickCount/TickCount64. As a result, expressions involving TickCount won't work on dumps.
Currently, in minidumps, the VS debugger just evaluates TickCount in the current debugger context, which is wrong and instead should spew an error that we can't evaluate Environment.TickCount. DateTime.Now is also currently evaluated in the current context but that's fixable to instead plumb through the time when the minidump was collected."

My standard starting position is to ask the FDG what they have to say about it:

> DO provide good defaults for all properties and parameters (using convenience overloads), if possible.

OK, so if it's possible we should provide a good default.  So, what makes a good default in this case?  I think ""predictability"".

Let's imagine that we didn't have the parameter at all... so it's just `ResolveTarget()`, what would that do?  I feel like it would return the target value of the link... so non-recursive/non-final.  Now, in a future version, someone says ""it'd be nice if I didn't have to write the while loop myself, especially because I keep forgetting to put in an infinite loop detector"", so we add an overload.  The zero-arg version is still doing a single target resolution, because that's the method name.  The parameter then can control an ""actually, I want to keep going"" behavior.

So now lets just collapse that and look at it with a default parameter.  The name of the method is ResolveTarget.  Resolve is, admittedly, slightly ambiguous, so let's pretend it's named GetTarget.  Well, GetTarget is obviously ""give me the target value of this symlink"", so `link.GetTarget()` would be non-recursive.  To me, a similar thing applies when we let Get be called Resolve.  If we think that's where the ""but Resolve feels like it should keep going until final resolution"", then perhaps the better change is s/ResolveTarget/GetTarget, and now ""once"" is the ""obvious"" behavior, and ""keep going"" is the opt-in behavior.

The problem with recursive being the default is that it has unexpected behaviors.  If we have no work limiter, then mutually referential symlinks cause an infinite loop:

```
$ ls -al foo bar
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jbarton jbarton 3 Jul  8 09:38 bar -> foo
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jbarton jbarton 3 Jul  8 09:38 foo -> bar
```

If we do have a work limiter then mutually referential symlinks will.. do something.  Throw, return the last one it saw when it exhausted the work factor, something.  Whatever it does, you probably didn't expect it.  Sure, the docs'll mention it, but no one reads the docs until something goes wrong.

To me, from a logical perspective (of how I think about things), ""once"" is the correct default.  To me, from a security perspective (not ""hiding"" unexpected behaviors in server products), ""once"" is the correct default.  So, to me, we should just figure out what makes us happy with that choice (e.g. renaming Resolve to Get)."

"that is the issue... Application does not have a UI thread component. My initial case was to say that all bindable objects need a UI thread - like all the other platforms do, but unfortunately this breaks a lot of tests and things. We can change it later and just throw in the ctor if not on the UI thread, but that is for another PR.

However, right now if you create an object on a thread with a dispatcher, that is the thread you must stay on. If you do a background thread, then it will try find it each time and look up the UI hierarchy or fall back to Application.

It is wrong, but this is what forms did.

The correct solution is to not allow UI objects to be created off the UI thread. This should throw if null is returned: https://github.com/dotnet/maui/pull/2862/files#diff-ebb14ec14b8baeffdd7b0ae40ffc8bf0e8944f76fdea50fcbc737fb142bfb44aR24

"I don't care about it that much (It's definitely a ""you're holding it wrong"" situation IMO), but this failure mode is particularly bad."
"I could argue that the current behavior is wrong. It breaks the contract that OnAfterRender gets invoked when the batch has rendered on the target display. (In whatever form or shape that takes).

Given that the base class is not associated with any display technology and that the render never finishes, it makes sense to switch the implementation for a cancelled task.

I understand the ""obscure coupling"" argument, but I also believe that its not an obscure detail but front and center to the onafterrender contract. We've been telling developers that OnAfterRender runs when the display has been updated and references have been populated.

Our original default was wrong, because we would run it in a context where we can't actually perform a render, so returning Task.CompletedTask is bad.

My reasoning is that, Task.CancelledTask is the right thing to do because the base renderer will never complete an update and is only able to render static HTML. Derived classes provide the ability to update the display and complete a full render pass.

We also have quite a good amount of tests describing this behavior, so I'm not concerned about breaking anything without noticing.

Does ComponentContext.IsConnected change in circuits to signal disconnection? If so, I would stay away from using it for this, as we shouldn't simply avoid running the callbacks if we happen to hit !context.IsConnected

I do see your concerns but I think despite this being used to avoid running OnAfterRender callbacks, switching to Task.CancelledTask is the right thing to do for the base class, it just also happens to fix the problem.

Keep in mind that in RemoteRenderer we also cancel the completions when we dispose the RemoteRenderer, which is aligned with what this does here.

Then, it performs a bunch of async calls that are themselves not clear to me as to their intent (though i can come aronud around to the idea that if you knwo this is JTF, you can maybe squint and view no-configure-await as being intentional).  Then, it runs code that affectively says ""if i'm not on the UI thread, bad baddy badness will occur"", but i see nothing that ensures that safety.

Overall, i find this pattern highly confusing and very difficult to reason about.  Invariants are not made clear, and it seems far too easy to accidentally do the wrong thing."
dumb question... why are these node just refactoring tests.  and why are we not just doing a TestMissingAsync?
Bleagh.  Something is really wrong with all the progress tracking code in hte IDE currently.  We should be passing along the real progress-tracker that is used for doing progress updates in the dialog while the fix applies.  but that's definitely not your fault here.  so don't worry about it too much.  i'll have to see if i can fix this all up at some point :(
Note that the diagnostic we produce will squiggle all of `Test<System.String>` instead of just `System.String`. This is maybe not perfect (why not squiggle the particular type argument that's wrong?) but shouldn't impact usability much.

"Could you please share the test that you are using to measure `SimpleCoreIdSpeedCheck` reliability, and the results that you are getting?

I have build the following test to measure the reliability under harsh conditions (this is to be compiled directly against System.Private.Corelib - the only change that I have done was to flip SimpleProcessorNumberSpeedCheck to public):

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * Environment.ProcessorCount; i++)
            new Thread(() => { for (;;) GC.KeepAlive(new object()); }).Start();

        int fast = 0; int slow = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
        {
            if (ProcessorIdCache.SimpleProcessorNumberSpeedCheck()) fast++; else slow++;
        }
        Internal.Console.WriteLine($""{fast} {slow}"");
    }
}
```

I get results like:

```
C:\runtime\artifacts\bin\coreclr\Windows_NT.x64.Release>corerun test.exe
703 297
```

It means that this method gives wrong answer 1 out of 3 times under harsh conditions. That does not look very good. If I replace the early out with a counter (https://github.com/jkotas/runtime/commit/38ba7a415af2a6ad9c55687d1d2cef588310a9f9), I get results that look much better:

"I did not include `GetSettingsForProfile` in `AppSettings` because of the discussion on the other thread.

The way I'm imagining it, `TerminalApp` would now be responsible for...
1. creating a `TerminalSettings` from the `AppSettings`
2. passing that down to the `TerminalControl`

Because `TerminalSettings` is now a WinRT object in TerminalApp, it makes sense for TerminalApp to be responsible for synthesizing the `TerminalSettings`. So, adding a `GetSettingsForProfile` to `AppSettings` kinda breaks that abstraction separating the responsibilities of AppSettings and TerminalApp.

So I wanted to test having an upwards arrow indicator that turns into a downwards arrow when expanded. I couldn't find any easy way of doing it. Please advice on how to add a visual element that toggles between two states depending on whether the expander is folded or not. If this is not supported I'd urge to add support for it as I can't see much use for an expander that can't visualise its state.

Thank you for the reply.

I am using a combination of virtualised rendering and collection views. The vertical part is done by a virtualised layout. I can play around with removing it but would rather see all scenarios supported.

Imho one of the largest drawbacks with Xamarin is that you can't just add UI components and have things work, as there's always some incompatibilities between the components. I don't think this should make its way into the main repo unless it works in all scenarios. It is not a good look if you have to rewrite your UIs several times just to find a permutation of components that works.

Also, any pointers regarding toggling a visual element, which I think is mandatory for the consumers to understand that it is a foldable element? I really think it should be doable straight in XAML.

Thanks!"
"> Oh yeah, that's right 0... there are ZERO Unit Tests that cover this concern.

Yea @github created the PR yesterday and it's not merged and it's being actively worked on. 

> This is exactly my point on what Xamarin.Forms should be doing.

It will. See previous comment. If something is missed making your code untestable create an issue and we'll abstract and fix

Anything that currently exists that gets testability broken should break our xplat tests. If it doesn't then our xplat tests are lacking and we'll add more. 

> This is exactly why we've been saying for a long time that Xamarin.Essentials was never architected to be directly used by anyone who wants to test their code.

My comments were specifically targeting this statement about how X.E was architected to make testing impossible which is a statement I don't understand.  I'm first just establishing that Essentials is fine and doesn't need interfaces and then we build out from there. If there's something fundamentally wrong with Essentials that will make it impossible for us then let's fix that. 

But from your most recent comments it sounds like you're totally fine with us depending on essentials and that essentials itself is fine but that we should just be careful to not break forms xplat testability. Which we will be.

I think it might actually be the other way around, because after I think about it, I don't want the `@github` resolution rules to apply anywhere else.

This implements CFB one shots.

Some implementation notes:

1. As discovered in #55477, CFB128 and CFB64 do not work with persisted CNG keys, they always work in CFB8 mode today. Rather than replicating this wrong behavior, `AesCng` and `TripleDESCng` will throw if the key is persisted and the feedback size is other than 8. This limitation can be removed, if it is possible, when the linked issue is solved.
2. RC2 does not support CFB at all, so the implementation throws.

Closes #2406

```

If you notice, `BB114` is still in the predlist of `BB116` which seems wrong. When LSRA tried to add resolution moves, it adds it inside `BB114` because it is the pred of `BB116`.

```
BB114 bottom: move V00 from STK to rsi (Join)
```

and that generates the bottom 2 instructions

```asm
       488B75D8             mov      rsi, gword ptr [rbp-28H]
       EB2F                 jmp      SHORT G_M28654_IG89
```

I was also puzzled why `BB114` doesn't get removed in the ""dead blocks removal"" phase and that's because somehow our data structure is outdated and we still think that `BB114` is reachable via `BB113` (which has been already removed), which was in the past reachable via `BB107` (as seen in the first BB blocks I pasted).


Just to summarize:
1. Remove branch to unconditional jump should remove the block from the pred list of destination block.
2. Make sure that the data structure reflects that so such blocks are eliminated in ""dead removal phase"".

I will send PR to fix them, but yes, there is lot of dead code hanging out there.

"the callback form doesn't prevent crashes.  ReplaceNode, today, fundamentally can just crash on you if you end up replacing a node that no longer exists due to a previous operation.  

i.e. say you had:

The important question is: is this a reasonable scenario where you could expect nesting or not?  In my opinion, the ```== null``` scenario is not.  So spending time on the callback form just isn't relevant.

Yep, because there’s a circularity that we falsely resolve and don’t report. I think the bug is that we _don’t_ report a circularity error— the “workaround” is the bug.

And my earlier comment:

It turns out the simple form `B<T>` (`Mixin<typeof CQuark>` in this test case) simply resolves to `any` in this case without triggering any errors, so that doesn’t actually work either, so I feel better about this interface example being an error.

Can you clarify why?

I can't see why the change is wrong. The [documentation for IsImplicitlyDeclared](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.isymbol.isimplicitlydeclared?view=roslyn-dotnet) states:

> Returns true if this symbol was automatically created by the compiler, and does not have an explicit corresponding source code declaration.

And that's the case with the symbol `<Program>$` (i.e. SimpleProgramNamedTypeSymbol). It is automatically created by the compiler and it's indeed doesn't have an explicit source code declaration."

If the answer is 'yes' then I'm curious how it works since by default `fs.watch` is [not recursive](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener) so if initially you had watcher for '/a/b/c/d' and then you install one for '/a/b' then after closing watcher for '/a/b/c/d' you'll receive no notifications about changes in this file

"Hi, I want to point a small regression that I believe has been introduced by this PR 😕 Alas I haven't been able to isolate a MNWE after 1 day trying to extract code from my project and reaching 200 lines in the non so minimal and still working example 😞 

TLDR: [This project](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa) builds in TS4.5.2 but doesn't in TS 4.5.3 (nor in 4.5.5).
Given the error message and the crashing on our controlled-recursive type, I do believe that this PR is the cause of it.

We are building recursive type but controlling the recursion through a `type Depths = [-1, 0, 1, 2]` (ensuring `Depths[D] = D-1`), then the type looks like (over simplified) `type Nested<T, D extends number = 3> = D extends -1 ? T : Nested<T, Depths[D]>`. The `D` parameter ensures that type recursion stops…

Of course, [the actual type](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/blob/main/packages/alfa-act/src/interview.ts#L28-L47) is much more crazy. It models an ""interview"" which is a sequence of questions (asked to an oracle), where each question expects a typed answer (`T` is a representation of this type (e.g. `""boolean""`, `""string[]""`), and `A` is the actual corresponding type (e.g. `boolean`, `Array<string>`); the `QUESTION` parameter is meta-data mapping the questions' URI to their type). An interview may contains several questions in a row (hence the recursion), and the depth is used to make sure the type works.

The type itself does build in TS 4.5.3, but then the way we use it (through yet some other layers of complication) breaks…
I've tried to adapt the code to get it working in 4.5.5. From first attempts, it seems that giving some hints about the actual value of `D` helps 🤔 It feels like TS is now too eager in setting `D=3` and thus struggles when nesting interviews…

I don't really consider this as a bug. Feels more like a very corner case… Plus haven't been able to get a MWNE to study… But I guess you might want to hear about it 😊 
(and my secret hope is that you'll have a ""aha!"" moment seing the description and knowing the content of this PR much better than me 😀 )"
So is it *wrong* to do it in `program.ts`? Do we need both? I'm mostly asking for my own understanding.
"> Which platforms support all of the options?

I don't think there's a single platform that supports everything.  (or maybe something like tvOSSimulator where you could probably choose to use the JIT, or mini or LLVM AOT, with or without interpreter as a fallback).

> Is this something we should expose directly as a non _prefixed property?

I don't think so.  1. The `MONO_AOT_MODE_*` constants in the runtime embedding API are a confusing mess. 2. The `--aot=[opts]` AOT compiler options don't map onto them exactly and give a different matrix of configurations - not all of which are sensible, and they don't really give you a good idea of what behavior you chose.

It would be better to have some frontend property that lets you pick the behavior you want and then errors out if you pick something unsupported: 
* Primary execution mode: AOT, JIT, interpreter
* Fallback execution mode: AOT, JIT, interpreter, none
* (optional) codegen backend: mini, LLVM, or bitcode 

Not every combination of primary/fallback is sensible; not every combination of primary/fallback is supported on every workload; not every codegen backend is supported on every platform - and for most workloads there's probably one reasonable default.
(And I probably missed some execution mode that doesn't fit this pattern).

But at least it expresses intent, rather than our odd choice of constants from some header file.


---

Mapping our existing execution mode schemes:

| Name | Primary EE | Fallback EE | codegen backend | Note |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| JIT    | JIT              | None            | mini   | |
| LLVM JIT | JIT      | None  | LLVM | |
| AOT  | AOT | JIT | - | ""regular"" AOT: minimal effort AOT, no generic sharing for valuetypes |
| ""hybrid"" AOT | AOT | JIT | - | like ""full"" below, but with a JIT fallback |
| ""full"" AOT | AOT | None | mini | |
| LLVM Only | AOT | None | LLVM | Use our fork of LLVM |
| bitcode | AOT | None | bitcode | Produce LLVM bitcode that upstream vanilla LLVM can use |
| Interp | AOT | Interp | mini | (I think this prefers AOT images if it finds them)
| LLVMOnlyInterp | AOT | interp | LLVM/bitcode(?) | (comment in jit.h is wrong, this doesn't set 'force_use_interpreter', so I think it will prefer to use AOT images)
| InterpLLVMOnly | Interp | None | LLVM / bitcode(?) | (comment in jit.h is wrong, this sets 'force_use_interpreter' so it will interpret methods, but I think it will take trampolines from AOT images)
| InterpOnly | Interp | None | -(?) | (I think this one tries to JIT trampolines on non-DISABLE_JIT platforms)

This isn't a perfect description because inside the runtime there's no single primary/fallback switch - it's more like a series of conditions ('force_use_interpreter', whether AOT images are found and contain the expected method, whether to use ""aot trampolines"", etc) and what gets compiled into the AOT images and which backend was used.

This means we get oddities like ""InterpOnly"" on Android (and Mac Catalyst, I think) will try to JIT trampolines."
"My last try (promised!) - This is a doc I wrote for my implementation (at least I would have tried everything I could to gain attention on this)...

## Json polymorphism support

One of the big issue to solve when de/serializing objects is to manage polymorphism: when an abstraction must be serialized, the type of the serialized object **must** also be written so that deserialization know what to instantiate.

### The classical approach
The classical approach here is to inject a `$type` (or `_$type$_` or any strange enough property that contains a string with the name of the type) into the object properties. 
Since in JSON, collections (arrays, lists, sets) are expressed with `[arrays]` (and this cannot hold any property), another syntactical
construct is required for collections, typically something like `{ ""$type"" : ""A(int)"", ""$values"" : [1,2,3] }`.

Note that, in this approach, serialized objects with or without a type are structurally identical (only the existence of the `$type` property makes the difference) whereas serialized collections ARE structurally different (they appear inside a ""wrapper"" object).

> When is a `$type` NOT required? When the object's type is *statically known*, when the de/serialized type is *unambiguous*. As soon as 
> an ambiguity exists, **polymorphism** is at stake.

The `object` type being the ""worst case of polymorphism"", but any interface or base class with specializations are *ambiguous*), the runtime type of the object MUST be serialized and MUST be used to deserialize the object.

We consider ""Structural Difference"" between unambiguous and polymorphic objects to be a good thing since this obliges the reader to take care of the *object's type* if there is one.
Without any difference in the shape of the data, a polymorphic object can be falsely read as an object of an *unambiguous* (wrong) type. 

### Structural Polymorphism

We are using a different approach that offers the following advantages:
- No ""magic name"" like `$type` or `$values`.
- Uniform type handling for objects and collections: there is always a ""Structural Difference"" between a *polymorphic* and an *unambiguous* shape.

Thanks to this, the code is simple and can be split in 3 layers:
- Nullable layer: the `null` occurrence is handled.
- Polymorphic layer: a 2-cells array is expected, the first cell containing the type name, the second one the unambiguous object's representation.
- Unambiguous layer (the exact type is known): the serialize/deserialize code handles purely the object's data.

Last (but not least) advantage of this approach: **when deserializing, the type is known BEFORE the object's data**. This enable deserializer to easily work in ""pure streaming"" (no lookup required, no intermediate instantiation): the Utf8Reader can be used directly.

Below is a simple example with:
```csharp
class Person
{
   public string Name { get; set; }
}

class Student : Person
{
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

class Teacher : Person
{
    public bool IsChief { get; set; }
}
```

The C# `Student[]` is an array of Student. There is no specialization, hence no ambiguity: `[{""Name"":""A"", ""Age"":12},{""Name"":""B"", ""Age"":13}]`.

The C# `Person[]` can contain 3 different types of objects. Each item needs to be ""typed"":
`[[""Student"",{""Name"":""A"", ""Age"":12}],[""Person"",{""Name"":""E""}],[""Teacher"",{""Name"":""T"",""IsChief:false}]]`.

When the same array of Persons is known only as an object[] (or any other non-unique ""base"" type like the non-generic `ICollection`), then the array itself requires its type:
`[""A(Person)"",[[""Student"",{""Name"":""A"", ""Age"":12}],[""Person"",{""Name"":""E""}],[""Teacher"",{""Name"":""T"",""IsChief:false}]]]`

This PR (which relies on the custom marshalers PR, #47640) introduces a new icall (```InvokeJSFunction```) that is used to invoke JS functions from C#. It takes a 'do it yourself' approach to things like error handling (in order to avoid JS roundtrips for try/catch blocks) and attempts to remove overhead in various other places so that scenarios not needing that overhead can be much faster. It's also designed to be (partially) AOT friendly by making the core icall not generic.

The icall enforces some rules to produce good performance:
* The name of the function being invoked must be interned. This allows the function itself to be cached using the address of the interned string as a key (interned strings are not relocatable), so the lookup is very fast.
* The function pointed to must not change at runtime (so it can be cached).
* The function being invoked must not return a value, if it does the icall will return an error code.
  * This is because marshaling a return value of unknown type means we have to box it - JS->C# invokes already pay this unavoidable tax and it sucks.
* The function being invoked must not throw an Error, if it does the icall will return an error code.
  * Marshaling exceptions universally is finicky and in some scenarios the caller wants to handle the error in their own way, i.e. set a flag or store info on the error somewhere instead of throwing a C# exception.
* The maximum number of arguments is 3.
* All arguments are passed as ```(RuntimeTypeHandle type, IntPtr arg)``` pairs, where (depending on type):
  * If ```type``` is a pointer, ```arg``` is the raw pointer value.
  * If ```type``` is a ValueType, ```arg``` is the address of the value.
  * Otherwise (if ```type``` is a reference type), ```arg``` is the address of the location of the object reference on the stack. This is so that if the GC relocates the object, the callee will see the new post-relocation address.

The new icall offers some new features as part of the deal:
* The function name can contain dots (i.e. ```Module._free```) and the icall will walk the scope chain to find the target function - we can afford to do this since we cache the result.
* If the function name starts with ```BINDING```, ```MONO``` or ```INTERNAL```, the icall will look the function up inside the appropriate runtime API object instead of in the global scope, so those function names will work even if we are running modularized and they are not exposed in the global scope.

For scenarios not covered by the new icall, the intended solution is to expose higher-level convenience wrappers that provide the bells and whistles people expect. This keeps the icall slim and fast so that in use cases where you want maximum performance, you can get it. At present the PR provides ```InvokeJSResult InvokeJSFunctionByName<T1, T2, T3> (string internedFunctionName, ref T1 arg1, ref T2 arg2, ref T3 arg3)``` as a convenience wrapper that automatically handles producing the type/address pairs for you.

As a proof of concept, the PR changes ```JSObject.Invoke```, ```JSObject.SetProperty``` and ```JSObject.GetProperty``` to go through the new icall. I have a feeling we don't actually want to do this, but it serves as a good example of how to use the icall and was also useful for flushing out bugs and getting a sense of its performance.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/67313

While performing string `StartsWith` or `EndsWith` operations we try to optimize when having ASCII characters. We apply the optimization only if we don't have characters outside ASCII range nor we don't have characters need special handling (like `\0` which treated as ignored character). We detect the special character by using internal the internal table `HighCharTable`.  In some cases, we can have the source string be shorter than string we check (e.g. doing something like `""A"".StartsWith(""A\0"")` , we check the remaining character `\0` if it is ASCII but we don't check if it is special character using `HighCharTable`. This cause StartsWith/EndsWith return the wrong result. 
The fix is simply adding the check using `HighCharTable` to ensure the correct result.

">VisitBlock [](start = 34, length = 10)

I would think that the case of a single declaration and the case of a multi-declaration should largely be the same. A multi-declaration is just a sequence of single declarations. But currently the implementations for both cases have nothing in common.
Let's test combinations of single- and multi- declarations in the same method.

Also, something feels wrong about the structure of this method:
- In the case for single-declaration, we don't pass the declaration that we found into `LowerBoundLocalDeclarationUsingVar`. But in the multi-declaration case we do.
- It's not clear why we return once a declaration is reached. If `LowerBoundLocalDeclarationUsingVar` and `LowerBoundMultipleLocalDeclarationUsingVar` can handle the chaining with subsequent using-variables, then we don't need this top-level loop."

"> This PR adds the same getCanonicalUri method from resolvers to file system providers.

Needing to duplicate an API in two places tells me that both places are wrong. Why isn’t there one central place where extensions can register such canonical uri logic? 

Assuming, there is `FileSystemProvider#getCanonicalUri` would you suggest that VS Code calls this all the time for things like knowing what the true casing of a path is? Today, we assume that all paths that are returned from a FSP are canonical and that they don't go through further massage. 

I believe that you don't want to get in the business of canonical uris because it will quickly turn into a bottom-less hole. Isn't your the problem more like ""How do I know that the `vls:///foo/bar`-workspace is actually the `file:///foo/bazz`-workspace?"" Do you maybe just need a ways of introducing ""aliases"" for workspaces?"
"I have some more clues now. It indeed seems like the current ”solution” in this PR only really patches the symptom of something else going wrong. 

Here's is the code where this PR

```typescript
	public lookupPrimaryKeybinding(commandId: string, context?: IContextKeyService): ResolvedKeybindingItem | null {
		let items = this._lookupMap.get(commandId);
		if (typeof items === 'undefined' || items.length === 0) {
			return null;
		}

		const itemMatchingContext = context &&
			Array.from(items).reverse().find(item => context.contextMatchesRules(item.when));
		return itemMatchingContext ?? items[items.length - 1];
	}
```

When the bug happens `context.contextMatchesRules()` fails to match any of te bindings that are returned from `this._lookupMap.get()`. Which leads to a ”best guess” fallback, which does not have enough information for making an informed guess. I saw somewhere that it should go in specificity order. And when both alternatives available for the fallback are equally specific, or bets are off.

Here are the two bindings defined for the case mentioned in #126306:

```json
            {
                ""command"": ""paredit.forwardSexp"",
                ""mac"": ""alt+right"",
                ""win"": ""ctrl+right"",
                ""linux"": ""ctrl+right"",
                ""when"": ""calva:keybindingsEnabled && editorLangId == clojure && editorTextFocus && paredit:keyMap =~ /original|strict/ && config.calva.paredit.hijackVSCodeDefaults && !calva:cursorInComment || calva:cursorAfterComment""
            },
            {
                ""command"": ""paredit.forwardSexp"",
                ""mac"": ""ctrl+right"",
                ""win"": ""alt+right"",
                ""linux"": ""alt+right"",
                ""when"": ""calva:keybindingsEnabled && editorLangId == clojure && editorTextFocus && paredit:keyMap =~ /original|strict/ && !config.calva.paredit.hijackVSCodeDefaults && !calva:cursorInComment || calva:cursorAfterComment""
            },
```

They are equally specific, only differing in wether `config.calva.paredit.hijackVSCodeDefaults` should be true or false, giving the command palette and other call sites an arbitrary binding alternative.

However, whatever is translating the actual keyboard events successfully interprets the context and the `when` clauses of the alternatives. So we shouldn't have to be guessing at all here."

You're not crazy. 

@github and @github - I'm leaning very heavily in the direction of going back to `Content.ToString()` for this and simply logging a warning for the unsupported platforms. It's more consistent, easier to implement, and easier to maintain. I know we have visibility issues with those warnings, but I think that's a separate issue.

"`parameter.ExplicitDefaultConstantValue` doesn't return a bad constant value in this scenario, because it doesn't really know that something is wrong yet. Using the `void F(object param = F()) { }` case as an example:
1. We compute the default value for `param`. The first thing we do is bind the default syntax value.
2. We bind the call to `F()`, including its default arguments.
3. We compute the default value for `param`. (This is reentrant.)
    - Since the completion part `StartDefaultSyntaxValue` has been set, we just return `ConstantValue.Unset`, and enter this code path that this comment thread is attached to.
4. After that we pass the bound default value (the call `F()`) to `ParameterHelpers.ReportDefaultParameterErrors`.
    - This reports `ERR_DefaultValueMustBeConstant` and returns `true`
5. Since `ReportDefaultParameterErrors` returned `true` we return `ConstantValue.Bad` as the ""final"" default value for the parameter.

I'll add a test that will hopefully illustrate this better, at least the last part, since I can't seem to find such a test added in this PR already.

Note that the behavior of returning `ConstantValue.Unset` occurs both for reentrant scenarios as well as for multithreaded scenarios. It's possible that we want to do something like have a reentrant usage return `ConstantValue.Bad`, while a multithreaded scenario will spin wait until the constant value is available. I am actually not sure how to accomplish that in `SourceComplexParameterSymbol.DefaultSyntaxValue`. Perhaps the binder should instead avoid accessing the default value on a parameter if `BinderFlags.ParameterDefaultValue` is set and just use `ConstantValue.Bad` as a placeholder.

Also, I had hoped to pass `hasErrors: true` here so that we will always fail in emit if no other (better) diagnostic is given, but it ended causing some diagnostic reporting in `ParameterHelpers.ReportDefaultParameterErrors` to be skipped, and I wasn't sure how to square it all without causing a lot of test churn. #Closed"
"Uh, er, is this really something we want to do?  Depend upon an *internal* target?

This feels wrong and brittle."
I re-read my comment and I think I sent the wrong message. It looks to be working properly. Good stuff!
"> For what it's worth, I think that handling this in emit is actually quite a bit more complicated, and potentially error prone, then having this handled in binding and letting it flow through ""naturally"".

The nature of the changes that were made in binding resulted in observable changes in behavior of APIs that compiler implements and likely resulted in unintended binding behavior changes. Though it might feel simpler to adjust binding behavior in this way in order to achieve desired IL gen outcome, that would cause compiler to behave not according to the language specification in an observable way. This would be the wrong thing to do.

this is intentional, yea. In general, I thought that the Remoting lib could exist regardless of the fact that it's exclusively being used for the Terminal. Not having a dependency on the settings model makes the build for that project a lot simpler too. Though, this is something I'm hitting with tear-out now too - it absolutely would be easier just to pass the `ActionAndArgs[]` up to the monarch to have them dispatch it, but I'd really rather avoid it.

At least for Sublime, it'll restore all the previously closed windows, then _also_ open the newly requested one.

3. Projects where the developer will appreciate using a monitoring solution (AppInsights, OpenTelemetry, etc) or ad-hoc tools (dotnet-counters) to make the stats available for them in the future: 10-20% apps
4. Projects where neither the stats nor the perf matters: 50+% of apps

I'm worried about the experience of people in group (3). I want them to be able to turn on telemetry very easily when they want it.

"Nope, that's not the same at all 😄 

If and _only if_ every export has an export modifier, then we can strip the export modifier from every export and retain the same meaning. With your suggestion, we'd remove export modifiers from everything, even if some things didn't have export modifiers, which is very wrong and would make privates public."
"@github It doesn't relate to the old code. The previous version calls `getParameterSymbolFromJSDoc`/`getHostSignatureFromJSDoc` for each parameter. The proposed version works the opposite. To get tags in TS/JS I moved this check to the `signature` level. Then, to compare parameters with tags, instead of using `indexOf` (in this case I think `indexOf` gives O(n) complexity) for each tag., I moved the parameters to `Set`. The `Set` is then used in the `jsdocParameters` loop to check for existing parameters by `JSDocParameter` name. Maybe this is the wrong direction, and a different approach should be taken here :(."

"> Yeah, but we are not just shuffling bytes here. The callback is responsible for a bunch of stuff other than just pushing bytes to the connection -- e.g. assigning stream ID. framing, etc.

In the end its all bytes, you'd just shift from doing it earlier to doing it later. You enqueue the write and then later frame the buffers on the way out. This has the added benefit of potentially batching bigger writes together framed a single HTTP/2 data frame on the wire.

For reference, here's Kestrel's implementation:

This is where the loop is kicked off:

https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/a861d18d244a632281ef4a1402f29ad1051e5bf9/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http2/Http2OutputProducer.cs#L77

This is the loop itself:
https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/a861d18d244a632281ef4a1402f29ad1051e5bf9/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http2/Http2OutputProducer.cs#L392

Http2FrameWriter is the component that does the flow control and adds http framing to the bytes:
https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/a861d18d244a632281ef4a1402f29ad1051e5bf9/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http2/Http2OutputProducer.cs#L451

The callsite writes to the pipe directly and flushes:

My test was wrong and I have fixed it
"The particular value of the runtime base check isn't to validate them in cases where there is a cross-module boundary. Its to validate the data that *would be* used in a cross module boundary to ensure that the general type layout processing is correct. It turns out that while not exactly matching up to a useful value, it has been quite valuable at finding all kinds of edge cases that do affect the within version bubble cases. In particular, it is good at finding cases where the alignment calculations were subtly wrong in a way that didn't cause a field offset to be wrong in that particular test case, but could have caused a problem for other fields on the type.

Now, if it turns out the only incorrectness is caused by this incorrect conflation of cross boundary and non-deriving, we could use a different sentinel value like 0xFFFFFFFF or something or simply not allow a sentinel value for types that derive directly from object. @github I assume that you have an arm32 test environment where you can test this locally? Relying on the CI for this sort of testing is a giant time waster.

Also, what I've found in the past is that when a layout issue is particularly nasty is that I need to build a standalone repro of the bug, and debug in parallel through the native CLR type layout logic and the managed type layout logic and find where they differ. I worry that when you consolidated the 3 different ways in which we calculated base offset that you actually removed a way in which they are required to be very subtly different."

<hr />

This fixes an issue in Server GC where an item in the finalizer queue became stale due to not being relocated.

The problem was that a finalizable object was allocated on one heap, but registered in the finalizer queue of another heap (this is possible due to heap balancing). In CFinalize::UpdatePromotedGenerations, we ask for the generation of an object, and move the object to the correct section of the finalizer queue. In the error case, we obtained the wrong result for the generation of the object because it lived on another heap, and that heap hadn't set the final generation for the region containing the object yet. So we ended up moving the finalizer entry to the section corresponding to gen 2, and missed a relocation of the object occurring in a gen 1 collection afterwards.

Fix: It seems best to make sure an object is always registered for finalization on the heap it's allocated from, so the fix simply fetches the heap from the alloc context after the allocation in the case of SOH, or determines it by calling gc_heap::heap_of in the case of LOH and POH. In the case of SOH, I added an assert to ensure that the heap obtained agrees with the result of calling gc_heap::heap_of.

I also added some dprintf calls to the finalizer logic to aid in future investigations.

"> There's 0% benefit on any Windows system with any file system?

According to https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120120-00/?p=8493 (which might be outdated as it was referring to Windows 7):

> If you issue around six reads in a row, each of which begins where the previous one left off, then the cache manager switches to FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN behavior for your file

But here for 99.99% of the cases we perform a single read (the size of the buffer passed to the OS is equal to the file size). I would expect it to be smart enough to recognize the pattern.

> Should we simply change the implementation to only specify this on Windows, since there it's (I believe, please correct me if I'm wrong) free 

From the benchmarks that I've run (Win 11 + SSD + NTFS + BitLocker) I see no perf gains. I can add it for Windows if you think it's worth it just in case it's beneficial for some other configs (older Windows? FAT32?). "

I have reused the logging message that the HTTP layer reports when a request is completed without reading the request body.

"> Because it's not too challenging to get right at this scale. 

That's not an acceptable reason.  Complexity has to justify itself over non complex solutions.  ""because we can"" isn't a reason.   We have countless examples of unnecessary complexity being something that has significantly impacted us in extremely poor ways over Roslyn's lifetime.  There are times when it is appropriate, and data shows the value we get out of that.  But in the absense of that, we should be going for the simplest, correct, solution we can provide.

In this case, it seems like a simple lock, with a couple of data fields (or one, if you want to just merge the boolean + the count into one field), would be sufficient.  It would then be far more trivial to review, comprehend, and maintain.  

There's nothing wrong with using a lock.  It's what we do almost entirely in the IDE code (that, or just using tasks ordering), and it works very well and is consistent with the rest of the code.  Since we don't use these lock-free/wait-free forms, this means this code is automatically much harder to reason about since it's different from our standard patterns and practices, and practically no one on the IDE routinely codes this way.

Please follow the patterns of the rest of the IDE unless we have data that indicates substantive problems with those approaches that warrant these types of solutions."
"@github, I think those test failures are an issue caused by running on the wrong runtime.

Note the result for https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=1138686&view=ms.vss-test-web.build-test-results-tab&runId=34540072&resultId=123876&paneView=debug which actually passes.

I can see in AzDo, that the failing test ran as part of workitem `{ ""HelixJobId"": ""91361424-0db7-42aa-ba2d-5656f83b8c40"", ""HelixWorkItemName"": ""Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Embedded.Tests--net461"" }` and the successful one ran as part of `{ ""HelixJobId"": ""91361424-0db7-42aa-ba2d-5656f83b8c40"", ""HelixWorkItemName"": ""Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Embedded.Tests--net6.0"" }`

Looking at those names, I'm suspicious. Does that imply that the failing test actually tried to run the binary on the .NET 4.6.1 runtime, and the succeeding test ran on the .NET 6 runtime. If so, that is an indication that the test passed just fine as we don't expect these images to actually work on .NET 4.6.1 after running crossgen.

   - `profileColor`: fall back to the profile's color

> I wrote that rule :) A diagnostic means that the tree is not valid in some fashion.

Neal was the compiler advocate for improving re-usability of nodes in incremental parsing and many features were added with parser-level language check under his watch after he'd created this document. The point of the rule is that we parse the best we can and get the same tree shape regardless of langver.
You're correct that we made an explicit exception for record-parsing (langver affects the shape of the tree in that case, ie. goes beyond diagnostics).

> this makes parsing not context free.

No. Incremental parsing is not impeded by having a language version diagnostic on new language syntax. In practice, what context-free means is that we prefer to avoid is passing flags into nested parsing methods. It doesn't mean we shouldn't produce langver diagnostics (as the many features added since discussion demonstrate).

> 
> I would sync with @github and @github on this. When designing the `TargetFramework` changes, we had said that we would recommend being explicit about the platform versions for iOS and Android.

Yes, I totally agree that the message to app developers should be that they should be explicit about the platform version (and that should be reflected in our samples and templates).

However, in this particular case, it's for our own (the Xamarin.iOS' team) tests, and things get a bit less clear.

> For a given version of .NET, we should not change the default target platform version out from under you (once we've shipped an RTM of the tools supporting that version). So if `net6.0-ios` means version 13.6 of iOS, we can't change the SDK later on so that it means 13.7 or 14.0. Once we add support for `net7.0-ios`, we could choose a different default platform version in that case.

I think one thing that should be clarified is who exactly defines the default target platform version (who is ""we"" in the sentence above?)

I was under the impression that it would be the SDK teams (the Xamarin.iOS team for iOS), which means it would be the Xamarin.iOS team who would be responsible for updating the default target platform version whenever that can/should be done.

And in that case, as it stands with this PR, all our tests would start using the new default once we (the Xamarin.iOS team) change it (and that seemed like the behavior I'd expect when we change the default).

> So I don't know if leaving the platform version out of the `TargetFramework` would avoid needing to update the number anyway.

This is not something we ship, so we can always change our decision later if we find out that I was wrong."
Hmm - nothing immediately obvious stands out to me as being wrong.  Potentially the test workspace doesn't have the right reference for `System.Runtime.InteropServices`?  Not sure that is the case though.  I can check out this branch tomorrow (its the end of my work day now) and see if I can help debug where its going wrong and report back.
"Correct. The previous behavior was that this would *not* write out the file if it contained compile errors, but it's hard to diagnose why the file isn't compiling if you can't see it.

The current error message gave me no pointers on what was/went wrong when I had an extra parameter to `ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<SomeClass>(provider, usedParameter, unusedParameter)`. I experimentally found out that this causes issues. 

Adding to the error message that all parameters have to be consumed would have saved me some time, and I hope that this change will save some time for a future developer.

Example that gave me unclear instructions:
```cs

"> I mean, that's an interesting feature creep that requires a lot of human labor. An alternative here would be to simply run the SendToHelix task in an msbuild environment where warnings are not set as errors, which is why this warning was promoted to being an error. We've already tried just logging a message that used logging commands to be a warning in the build, this was ignored.

But this doesn't solve the problem that we start showing EOL to clients with no alternative to migrate to. I don't think that's a good experience for the client teams? It's not a lot of work too - we are already doing extra work when EOL warning starts for a queue, I think adding one more record to the YAML is not too crazy a requirement?
"
Wrong comment?
@github I would expect in the future that this experience is more integrated. I imagine support for this within razor itself (when it detects a component inside a view it knows what to do and offers appropriate intellisense) is that crazy?
Just to be pedantic since this change is taking longer than it needs to. What's wrong with `=`?
"Hi Ryan,
glad we are on the same page on the possible use cases for this.
I guess adding all those scenarios in the example will help to not get this comment lost. let me know if I can help.


------
David - you are on point mentioning logs, as it is relevant for all the scenarios, not only for tracing. As I started to replace the current logic on applications with this package (as I published a backport package to 2.1-2.2), it has been the main pain point (on top of the clumsy setup which now Ryan got much better :) ).

I was originally tempted to include the ability to also add the header to the logging scope, but it seemed out of scope. However right now to add a value to the logging scope you either have to capture it from the `HttpContext` again on a separate middleware or, expecially when you rely on the factory, you have to access the `HeaderPropagationValues` (which hold these values) from a separate middleware to add those values to the logging scope, which feels wrong (I guess ideally it should be internal but then you will close this door).

Sorry for going off topic, but It would be really nice to have your opinion on this. Thank you.

"
"nah. You and @github are right but for the wrong reason. "
Doesn't this allocate a crazy number of arrays?
I think I answered my own question [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23703/files#r450629775). You can correct me if I'm wrong.
"I would not do this - `RelatedAssemblyAttribute` is from Mvc.Core which is part of the framework, so pretty much always loaded into the default ALC. So this is the same as doing `AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath`.
If in the future something loads the ""main"" assembly (the one with the related assemblies on it) into a secondary ALC this will likely be wrong and things might break. I think it should be `AssemblyLoadContext.GetLoadContext(assembly).LoadFromAssemblyPath` - where `assembly` is the ""main"" assembly."
"You shouldn't need this check or the ""above 0x10FFFF?"" check below. If you change line 540 below to call `Rune.TryCreate` instead of `new Rune(...)`, that will detect UTF-16 surrogate or above-0x10FFFF inputs and return _false_. So you'd end up with:

```cs
if (!Rune.TryCreate(currentDecodeBits, out Rune rune) || !rune.TryEncodeToUtf16(/* ... */))
{
    return false; // something went wrong
}
```"
"Returning `Name` for the `RelativePath` will also be wrong. The test will fail no matter what. So, it is better to set the correct value or not set it at all"
"Yes, the comment is wrong."
"> With that, both formatters will do the serialization and check if the `model is null` and report back the `NoValue` state, that is where I feel we can do better, something like
> 
> ```cs
> if (model == null && !context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue)
> {
>     if ( [check for JSON-encoded value ""null""]) 
>     { 
>         bindingContext.ModelState.AddModelError(context.ModelName, ""The new message"");
>         return InputFormatterResult.Failure();
>     } 
> 
>     // Some nonempty inputs might deserialize as null, for example whitespace. 
>     // The upstream BodyModelBinder needs to
>     // be notified that we don't regard this as a real input so it can register
>     // a model binding error.
>     return InputFormatterResult.NoValue();
> }
> ```

I'm not sure we want to report failure at such a low layer. After all, `null` is one of the ""nonempty inputs might deserialize as null"" that the `BodyModelBinder` needs to know about. I don't think that either `!context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue` nor `EmptyBodyBehavior.Disallow` implies that a `null` literal should be rejected outright. It should be if the parameter is non-nullable, but we don't know that at the `InputFormatter` layer do we?

We probably should be changing this to return `InputFormatterResult.Success(null);` for `null` literals instead of `InputFormatterResult.NoValue();` regardless of `TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue` because it's not truly empty.

It's a literal default value, and the whole problem here seems to be that both empty input and null literals are being collapsed into a single `NoValue()` when `TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue` is `false`. It's fine for these values to be collapsed when `TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue` is `true`, because that's what you asked for, but not the other way around.

I don't think it's necessary to check if there was an empty request body or `null` because the method you're modifying, ` ReadRequestBodyAsync`, is only called when the body is non-empty (or at least we think it will be) that what the `canHaveBody` logic I linked to earlier was doing. It was deciding whether to call `ReadRequestBodyAsync` or return `NoValue()` immediately:

https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/39219394f66854db5d556ad78f9bb065ee48b585/src/Mvc/Mvc.Core/src/Formatters/InputFormatter.cs#L102-L116

And if the `canHaveBody` logic was wrong, and we thought there was going to be a body but it turned out to be empty, `JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync()` in  `SystemTextJsonInputFormatter` will throw a `JsonException` which will always be turned into a `Failure()`.

Unfortunately, Json.NET turns an empty body into `null` when you try to deserialize. Again the `canHaveBody` checks should prevent this from happening for most empty bodies but not all. I assume we copied the `if (model == null && !context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue)` logic from the `NewtonsoftJsonInputFormatter` to the `SystemTextJsonInputFormatter` because it makes very little sense in the latter case where it will only return `null` for a null literal and nothing else.

@github Is there anything wrong with just removing the `if (model == null && !context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue)` branch entirely `SystemTextJsonInputFormatter` and always `return InputFormatterResult.Success(model);` when `JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync()` doesn't throw?

I imagine we'll have to be more careful with the Json.NET input formatter for back compat. It's always reliably treated `null` and empty bodies as exactly the same because they were indistinguishable from just the call to `Deserialize`. We could in theory try to test if any bytes were actually read from the body stream after the fact to determine the difference, but that would be a breaking change."
"> not sure why you want that in the comment in the code

Because that's what people will be reading in the future... Please put yourself in my shoes for a moment.  Say i need to debug through this code 6-12 months from now.  Something has gone wrong and i step in here and i see this comment and this check.  Now i'm scratching my head tring to figure out what's going on and if this might be hte source of the problem i'm looking at.

Now, i have a few things that could help.  The most ideal would be clear explanations in the code of what's going on.  That allows me to understand while keeping me in context.

in the absence of that i must now do an external investigation of this code to try to figure out what's going on.  For example, i may have to now track this code back in git to figure out hte inception point, which can be brutally difficult at times, especially when code is moved *across* files.  This may or may not lead to me useful information.

As such, i far prefer when we try to make the code *itself* as clear as possible to help future maintainers.  Note that this is not a speculative concern.  As someone who had to try to track down many issues in formatting over hte years, this sort of approach to the code would have been *majorly* appreciated.

I do not feel like it is unwarranted or excessive to ask people making changes to complex and subtle parts of the system to then put in a little extra effort toward making the changes clearer.  it really goes a long way and is very appreciated.  Thanks much!"
this surprises me.  what was wrong with the prevoius color?
"In any case: if you don't investigate that prior to merge, I'd say you should instead disable the test (rather than update to an incorrect baseline) and file a tracking bug. The IDE generally does _not_ do the ""assert the wrong thing for now"" pattern."
"Unfortunately 'containsdiagnostic' is often wrong.  For example, syntactic *warnings* will trigger it.  

We should just get the SyntaxReferences for the NamedTypeSymbol though and check those directly (i.e. checking for the right severity).  

so this should be more like:

```c#
foreach (var syntaxRef in namedTypeSymbol.DeclaringSyntaxReferences) 
     if (syntaxRef.GetSyntax(cancellationToken).GetDiagnostics(...))`"
"> the language version check seems wrong 

I think the intent was to replace it with corresponding nullable warning and have it be enabled/disabled as all other nullable warnings.

"""Mirror"" represents LiveShare spinning up a proxy for the server IIRC.

">Also, I suspect there are other codepaths in binding we don't report all binding errors if the expression contains syntax errors.

"So, I've got some feelings about this new Color Schemes page. I think we might have gone ""too hard"" on Expanders, to the point where the page has lost coherence. It's a page for editing color schemes, it should not take so many clicks to _edit a color scheme_, you know? Hiding the various types of color, which are all kinda the same setting at the end of the day, in different groups... it rubs me the wrong way.

In addition to that, Add New and Rename getting their own areas, separate from the scheme, feels like they were just bolted on as an afterthought.

I want us to stop and reconsider this page, and how it flows. The preview on top, the scheme selector (which is a _single setting_ that controls the _contents of the page_), and then the colors might be the wrong order in which to tackle it.

If we had a ground-up redo, what would our color scheme editor look like? How would we want the user to flow through it?"
"`count - offset` looks wrong here, `offset` can easily be bigger than `count`, in which case you'd end up trying to create an array of a negative size.

var dstManagedBuffer = new byte [count];

"More I'm just not sure what advantage `Unbox` gives here. Typically I think of `Unbox` as useful when I want a `ref T` for the unbox. Essentially the ability to mutate the object. Here we immediately return the result by value hence I'm just not clear what `Unsafe.Unbox` is giving us here.

"That would require quite a lot of changes over the JIT code base as all code addresses in JIT are read-execute and the RW are used only at places where it is needed. So everywhere that dst is used now, it would become dstRE. That seemed like a noise change to me that would obscure the real changes.

> what would happen if a jit developer uses a wrong address for a write (dstRW instead of dstRE, or dstRE instead of dstRW)

If you attempt to write using dstRE address when jitting, the JIT would crash as it would not be able to write there. If you use the dstRW address instead of dstRE, it would be fine unless you use it for code relative address computation.
I've tried to use the dstRW only locally so that it would be hard to make such a mistake. The only exception is the NOP generating code that calls itself recursively and it would have to update the RE pointers to match the RW all the time.
In fact, I'd rather remove the dstRW usage at other places and change it to (dst + writeableOffset).

> will we see the issue on the platforms without W^X protection?

There will be no such platforms (except of crossgen usage of the JIT)

> Can we catch them at compilation time?

We would have to change all the `BYTE* dst` to `const BYTE* dst`, but it would still require the JIT developer to be disciplined enough to not to cast away the constness anywhere.

Frankly, my view on further updates to JIT were that everything would be done as before with the only exception being places where writes to the executable memory are added. At those places, the writeableOffset would need to be applied. But a bug in such a place would be easy and quick to discover - the JIT would just crash with access violation.

2. If we return a 0.0 in an indexer is wrong. Indexers should throw an exception if the GKBejaviour is not present.

We should get the value, check the result and decide if we have a null or not and throw and except and remove the ! which is wrong and makes no sense. The binding is wrong and therefore the nullability."

"We have added this message in the past to catch iadvertant use of export/import in the top level of a script file. ppl used to do this by mistak, and spend hours to understand what is wrong with thier program.

@github and I talked about this, and the conclusion was to leave a valid module target `--m none` which will trigger this error. this way users who are sure they never need a module loader can set it and get the nice error instead of having to go crazy figuring out what it means.
"
I would expect that codereviews would be good enough to catch wrong native library name if we add more of them.
"Aha! I stand corrected. The original code I was fighting with looked more like this (if memory serves):

```jsx
import React from ""react"";
import styled from ""styled-components"";

const Button: React.FC<{
  // Since this is missing className and style props, it is invalid.
  nope: string;
}> = () => <button />;

const Form = styled.form`
  ${Button} {
    color: rebeccapurple;
  }
`;
```

The error happens at `${Button}` but **I was able just now to successfully put** a `@github` on top of that, like:

```jsx
const Form = styled.form`
  ${// @github
  Button} {
    color: rebeccapurple;
  }
`;
```

As I recall, I was unable to put `@github` on top of this before. Perhaps a bug was fixed in either TS or prettier since I last tried or I'm remembering it wrong 😀."
"It's exciting to see that @github and his team are still pushing like crazy and shipping one feature after the other!

However and I don't want to be that guy *but* what's about long-term must-haves like full ES6 module support where quite some people are waiting for, eg. https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/18442?"
Putting in a request for dumps so we can find what actually is going wrong here
"On the other hand, I reached for Dns.GetHostName() function because the documentation said ""Dns Host Name"" right after discovering Environment.MachineName was wrong for our case (NETBIOS name wasn't useful to us). If the documentation were to change to say something else I would stop trying to fix it."

Unfortunately, the spmi collections, especially the benchmarks collection, have a lot of ""MISSING"" data currently, so it's not clear how that's skewing the data.

This kinda sucks....
"Because the test showed as flaky over the weekend and it's easier to add it to the PR that's changing the name of the attribute than it is to open a PR with the wrong name, and then have to deal with conflicts."
"Gzip happens at build time, Brotli happens at publish time, putting _Brotli there causes issues with no build as it forces the recomputation of a bunch stuff and ends up producing a wrong manifest."
"My last change uses `AssertEx` for sequence comparison. The output is indeed more informative :-)
Below is an example. Thanks!

```
Validation of method 1 failed.

Expected:
Public Sub Main,
WRONG,
Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Runtime.Instrumentation.FlushPayload()
Actual:

"in general, i'd like the assignment of this sort of hting to happen as soon as possible, rather than as late as posible.

That way if something goes wrong, we've already set that we tried to do the thing, and we avoid the bad paths in the future."
"> This never existed on 2.2 and 2.1 that’s a different issue.

@github I created [this demonstration](https://github.com/ldwedari/DotNetCore2_1DataRaceDemonstrator) based on the code that you posted in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/14975.
In 2.1.19 (master branch) there is a data race. But in 3.1.5 (TestWithNetCore3_1 branch) I cannot see it happening.

Is my test wrong? If it is correct, does this actually happens in 3.1.5?"
"Exactly, it gives us a chance to tell the client what they did wrong without them having to go dig through the server logs."
"❕ This is a collection initializer, not an object initializer (test is correct, but the method name here is wrong)"
"It's to support the syntax `public int Property readonly => 42;`, which means the same thing as `public int Property { readonly get => 42; }`.

Feel free to weigh in on the concrete syntax design in dotnet/csharplang#1710. (edit: whoops, had the wrong issue ID)"
">if (!Compilation.IsFeatureEnabled(MessageID.IDS_FeatureIndexOperator) || [](start = 12, length = 72)

This feels wrong. We should always bind as best we can (ie. as-if all features were enabled). The only difference should be the diagnostics produced."
"I feel that there should be an enum stating the type of the doc (Normal/Additional/Analyzer), and we can pass that along.  code that processed can operate on that enum and throw when they encounter a new type.  that will make our code at least *throwing* when we add new types, instead of silently doing the wrong thing."
This still seems wrong. This is explicitly only true when targeting older versions of netcore or framework.
What was wrong with using SUNOS as the name for all the flavors?
"if open is found before close, then its wrong syntax, lets parse the whole thing to be sure"
"@github can correct me if I'm wrong; I thought one was used for the tool that generates the refs and the other was used by the tool that ensures consistency between the refs and the src. I'm not sure why they're different, especially with both listed there as you highlight."
"I'm not sure it needs to be a diagnostic, there's no way the compiler can produce the scenario, so we don't have to worry about it in normal operation. But I think I'm with Jared on throwing an exception here: we would never expect a valid emit options to contain both encodings, thus trying to set both is wrong. The only way you could do that is if you're creating them yourself via the API and so an exception seems appropriate. We should try and make our APIs stop people creating things the compiler would never do.

### Summary

#### Test
1. ✅ bind nested commands to ""parent""
2. ❌ rebind ""parent"" to a plain ""newTab"" command

#### Discussion

This _should_ work. `ActionMap` is doing the following:
1. bind nested commands to ""parent""
	1. deserialize the command
	1. it's a nested command!
	1. add it to the action map
		1. check if it's a nested command (it is!)
		1. add it to `_NestedCommands`
	1. when name map is requested...
		1. go through non-nested commands (none)
		1. go through nested commands...	
			1. ""parent"" --> <nested commands> is added
2. rebind ""parent"" to a plain ""newTab"" command
	1. deserialize the command
	1. it's a ""newTab"" command!
	1. add it to the action map
		1. check if it's a nested command (it isn't!)
		2. add it to the `_ActionMap`
	1. when name map is requested...
		1. go through non-nested commands (none)
		2. go through parents (**I SEE THAT THIS IS THE PROBLEM NOW**)
		3. add nested commands

Ok, I see what the problem is now. Just had to think out loud for a bit. Looks like the order is wrong in `_PopulateNameMap`. I'll marinate on a fix and submit that tomorrow morning. But other than that (and a code format), we're good to go!"

"@github is that API used in your sample ?

It's nice to hide (or provide better API) than exposing `Selector` and `NSObject` in signatures - but without tests it's also easy too easy to get it wrong.

"Well, the test is just wrong. It turns out it doesn't pass when run without crossgen2, with exactly the same fault, but by putting the disable logic as IL in the test, we actually get testing that the behavior of the x86 type loader at runtime matches up with the behavior at crossgen2 time due to the presence of the --verify-type-and-field-layout switch that we use when compiling crossgen2 tests.

I agree though, I was quite disappointed to find that I needed to change the test.

As far as how much was passing, as I mentioned to you a couple days ago, I was looking for something different than endless infrastructure stuff, so I took a look at this, and its come pretty clean. At this point I believe our type layout is very nearly correct, as is our argument layout handling, which leaves whatever interesting details are special about x86 in the jit interface.

Please add a prototype comment to make this diagnostics more specific. #Closed"
"@github _Aside_ from the issue of path mapping (or more specifically, which paths we choose to map by default) I do not believe we need to prevent the search of parent directories for .editorconfig files by default. While it's possible for a .editorconfig file to affect a build, the conditions under which this would occur are unlikely, and all but impossible to result in someone shipping broken code.

Start with the first two mass filters:

**1. Most users will not have .editorconfig files**

These users are not affected by probing to the drive root.

**2. Of the users who have .editorconfig files, most will not have properties specified in them which affect C# compiler outcome.** Specifically, no properties previously defined on editorconfig.org affect which warnings are reported or the severity with which they are reported during a build

Probing to the drive root may change the set of .editorconfig files passed to the compiler on a local machine, but it will not change the build outcome (success/fail) or reported warning messages unless we e.g. add a new warning message for invalid .editorconfig syntax (which would be trivially resolvable).

Now we get a bit more specific.

**3. Most users will not have analyzers installed via NuGet**

For this category, even a custom pathological **.editorconfig** is only capable of changing the severity of warnings reported by the C# compiler itself. To break a build on a local machine, one would have to explicitly increase the severity of a C# compiler warning via a .editorconfig file which is not part of the project.

**4. Most users who customize .editorconfig in ways that affect builds will do so in the context of particular projects**

When **.editorconfig** is added to a specific project with root=true, searching to the drive root by default is not a problem.

**5. For the remaining user who wants to customize a build-affecting non-project-specific .editorconfig for some reason, they probably have a reason to do so and we have no real need to prevent them from doing so.**

Basically what this means is the only way a user can enter the scenario you were concerned about is if they take action with specific knowledge of the new system we are designing. The act of entering this situation all but ensures the user also knows how to get out of the situation if something goes wrong."
"In reality this file almost never changes because it's confusing to everyone when it does. I don't think you can do dynamic links here, but I've also never seen it cause a problem. I'd almost go so far as to say if it does cause a problem, we're probably doing something wrong anyway. 😄 "

"@github The use of the pooled writers comes at some long-term cost because there's now a lot of action-at-a-distance to reason about, and substantial risk of problems if we have any bugs that might leak instances in certain error cases.

I don't have a clear sense of what makes it necessarily the right way to organize it. Naively - and I know I'm probably wrong here - I would have guessed we'd just hold all the user-supplied objects in a dictionary, and then `<persist-component-state>` would serialize out the JSON directly to the response, without going through any other in-memory storage. Is it possible to give a brief description of why that's not sufficient?"
"> Any thoughts? One crazy idea I have is allowing changing the ""GetProxy"" name, so you could somehow configure the generator to use ""GetMyCustomProxy"".

Great point about collision. We can do as you suggested which can be hinted by an attribute. For example:
```csharp

[assembly: SignalRSourceGeneratorSuffix(""123"")]

[System.AttributeUsage(System.AttributeTargets.Assembly)]
public class SignalRSourceGeneratorSuffixAttribute : System.Attribute
{
    public SignalRSourceGeneratorSuffixAttribute(string name)  
    {
    }
}

hubConnection.GetProxy123();
hubConnection.RegisterCallbackProvider123(...);
```
^ I imagine we don't generate this attribute so the user would need to create one which can live in any namespace they like. As such it would be impervious to collisions.

I also looked into `internal` as you mentioned. There is a way around `InternalsVisibleTo` with aliasing however this would force the enduser to do `extern alias MyAlias` `using MyClass=MyAlias::MyClass` for every namespace or type from their dependency. This seems like a huge hassle. If there is an idea for a hassle-free approach, I'd be happy to look into that as well.

Regardless I think we should still make everything internal so chance of collision is minimized anyhow? (and the workaround is only needed when internal doesnt cut it)"
Actually... that might be wrong. IsReturnableConstruct considers individual accessors whereas you're looking at the actual property. I don't think this will work. Sorry :/

"an intermediary concept this PR introduces is that the two major clients of the diagnostics subsystem now pass in what behavior they want when calling into the DiagnosticService singleton.

Internally we see which mode we're actually in and we either pass along the diagnostics, or  pass along empty.  in essence only one side will work, and the other will see absolutely no diagnostics ever.

This is not pretty, but it was:

1. the cleanest way i could find to keep both systems around
2. required minimal and mechanical changes to both systems.
3. ensured that every entrypoint was guarded so diagnostics wouldn't accidentally sneak into the wrong client.

[build] Add support for NDK r23. (#6073)

Context: https://github.com/android/ndk/wiki/Changelog-r23#changelog

The most important NDK r23 changes for Xamarin.Android:

NDK r23 removes GNU Binutils.  We need to switch to using our bundled
copy of them, as per 27967cab.

Upstream NDK r23changes:

  * Includes Android 12/API-31 APIs.

  * Updated LLVM to clang-r416183b, based on LLVM 12 development.
    * [Issue 1047]: Fixes crash when using ASan with the CFI unwinder.
    * [Issue 1096]: Includes support for [Polly].
      Enable by adding `-mllvm -polly` to your cflags.
    * [Issue 1230]: LLVM's `libunwind` is now used instead of `libgcc`
      for all architectures rather than just 32-bit ARM.
    * [Issue 1231]: LLVM's `libclang_rt.builtins` is now used instead
      of `libgcc`.
    * [Issue 1406]: Fixes crash with Neon intrinsic.

  * Vulkan validation layer source and binaries are no longer shipped
    in the NDK.  The latest are now posted directly to
    [KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers].

  * Vulkan tools source is also removed, specifically `vulkan_wrapper`.
    It should be downloaded upstream from [KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Tools].

  * Refactored the toolchain file `android.toolchain.cmake`, basing
    it on CMake's integrated Android support.  This new toolchain file
    will be enabled by default for CMake 3.21 and newer.
    No user side change is expected.  But if anything goes wrong,
    please file a bug and set `ANDROID_USE_LEGACY_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=ON`
    to restore the legacy behavior.
      * When using the new behavior (when using CMake 3.21+ and not
        explicitly selecting the legacy toolchain),
	**default build flags may change**.  One of the primary goals
	was to reduce the behavior differences between our toolchain
	and CMake, and CMake's default flags do not always match the
        legacy toolchain file.  Most notably, if using
	`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, your optimization type will likely
	be `-O3` instead of `-O2` or `-Oz`.
	See [Issue 1536] for more information.

  * [Issue 929]: `find_library` now prefers shared libraries from the
    sysroot over static libraries.

  * [Issue 1390]: `ndk-build` now warns when building a static
    executable with the wrong API level.

  * [Issue 1452]: `NDK_ANALYZE=1` now sets `APP_CLANG_TIDY=true` rather
    than using `scan-build`.  `clang-tidy` performs all the same checks
    by default, and `scan-build` was no longer working.
    See [Issue 1452] for more details; no user-side changes should
    be needed.

"It is... complicated.

Logically, it is true for all non-shared (shared in the `__Canon` sense) fields, since they have unique identities (with one exception: overlapping RVA statics).

Implementation-wise, it is all over the place, I have a comment about it in the unfinished changes that captures the spirit:
```
// Ordinary statics select their types. ""Shared"" statics, however, select
// their version of ""the first field map"", which is then indexed into by
// the logical ""instantiation"" argument, though see below). Or, at least,
// that was the original intent behind the relevant logic.

// In practice, ""IsFieldAddr"" ""gets things wrong"", and we form selection chains
// that are too conservative/long. First, the IR representation for the ""boxed
// static"" case, on 64 bit, when not using CLS_VAR, makes us think that such fields
// are in fact ""shared"", and use the ""static offset"" selector for them. Second, it
// also makes us think the box itself is in fact the field. Third, only fields that
// logically are ""shared"" (between generic instatiations) need this ""static offset"",
// but all cases that use helpers will hit it, because their IR shapes are similar or
// identical. For example, for an access of a simple struct static field in R2R code,
// we will form this:
//
//   $staticOffset = CAST(heap[field][helper], ref <- struct)
//   $fieldValue   = heap[field][$staticOffset]
//
// This is not a correctness issue, as we form selections that are ""just"" too
// conservative, but it does make for a somewhat confusing experience, and leads
// to quite a bit if wasted memory and cycles.
```
You are right that this handling is incomplete, fixing it is WIP."
"Ah, well I guess this is an improvement then. Looking at the editor implementation of ECMD_TYPECHAR I guess it does forward to InsertText which is surprising to me. If you look at `TextTransactionMergePolicy` in the editor codebase it appears the requirements for merging are:
1. Both transactions were initiated through EditorOperations to get the merge policy. This argues against you having your own delete code (at least in some places. Others you're probably fine.)
2. The textual descriptions are the same.
3. Edits are consecutive.

In any case, I was wrong about how I thought the editor handled this, so I guess this is better than before. I'm still curious though why we're having to do so much work here rather than forwarding to nextHandler more.

why use a different diagnostic? the new one seems wrong here
"Fair enough; that's what I was getting at with ""easy to get the default wrong""."
"> But since no degradation is found, I don't see any issue. Is something wrong here?

I was asking just to make sure we were comparing apples-to-apples.  It sounds like it's probably fine. In the future it'd be good to rebase so you're comparing just the diff."
"> Note: i'd also be ok logging a watson. I'm not ok with throwing here as i think that would reflect a poor design choice for a componentto throw about incorrect assumptions it made about another component.

What happens if the code throws anyways because you forgot some check or made another mistake? To avoid crashing VS we need to have a recovery boundary somewhere upstream anyways, in code that implements the entirety of a user action (such as refactoring), report NFW there and perhaps let user know something went wrong without taking down VS.

As it is things will just not work and it might create confusion as how the feature is supposed to work."
"> Should I file an issue to refactor these as well to not use hard-coded mscorlib versions?

I don't think this is necessary. The way the old tests are written isn't necessary wrong, just not ""modern"". I also think that, as we speak @github is working on refactoring what references our tests are using. It is quite possible that the tests are going to be naturally ""modernized"" in the process."
"I like this proposal more than the other one. This is more explicit and less verbose. I understand the concerns raised here, but I think they should be considered features, and this should be used carefully by the community. I understand this is not always the case, and people could start using and misusing this for everything, but this is as for all the features that Typescript introduces. They are not always used as intended.

One particularly seems to be a good example of why this proposal is good for me. 

## Cross-library interop
Library A may have `type Radian = unique number`.
Library B may have `type Radian = unique number`.

And they _are_ different. Libary A can update is definition tomorrow to `type Radian = bigint`, and that would be ok. I understand that _if I have two nominal types, that both are numbers, seems wrong that they can't assign each other_, but is that what this is about? Having someway to declare a _unique type_?

If I can declare a _unique type_ that can be assigned to a different _unique type_ because they have the same shape, are they unique then? "
"> Mainly just to clean up the noise in logs

This is not a good reason.  The logs are telling us that something has gone critically wrong.  It is not ok to solve that by just having our code ignore hte issue.  If anything, we should be prioritizing determining the root cause *asap*."
"For one this being effectively a servicing fix - I would prefer it to be very targetted. But also, the function can fail for many reasons, and in those cases I think it's good to fail. The current experience on NanoServer or Linux is actually broken in my mind. There's no warning, but we produce something which will not work correctly. For example try building WPF app on NanoServer - the produces exe will be effectively broken (it will be CUI app which will show console, it won't have any icon, probably wrong manifest, ...)"
"Well, *return* types are checked without contextual typing: the following example has an error:

```ts
/** @github {(a: 1, b: 2) => boolean} Foo */
class C {
  /** @github {Foo} */ one (a,b) { return 1 }
}
```

That's from `checkReturnStatement`, which uses `getSignatureFromDeclaration >> getReturnTypeOfSignature`.

I'll see what goes wrong with parameters."
"> I decided to include ""A label is not allowed here"" because, even though it's not a runtime error on its own, if you use the label it will not be defined, which is a runtime error, and because the compiler error for the undefined label is so bad.

https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30408

> I decided not to include this error, since it's not a runtime error in ES2015 and above according to an SO answer I found. It's a useful error for TS, though; probably the error message should be changed to read ""An object literal should not have multiple properties with the same name."", or else it should be restricted to ES5-only. I filed #46815 to track that.

My 2 cents is to just make it a suggestion diagnostic - don't go too crazy with when and how to report this in JS, or modifying how it surfaces in TS."
"> and it's true that the msbuild task is using the wrong assets. In my case it's using C:\Projects\runtime\.dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\6.0.0-preview.3.21201.4\System.Private.CoreLib.dll but with the information that System.IO.File has been already moved to System.Private.CoreLib

@github was the one who brought the task over from arcade into dotnet/runtime so he's the right person to provide an answer. But to give you some more data meanwhile, the failing task isn't expected to run against the live shared framework as it contributes to the build itself. This is similar to msbuild and other tools that we use to build the repository which also run on a last-known-good shipped version of the shared framework (currently 6.0 Preview 3)."
"Locally I was able to build the main branch without any changes:

```sh
docker run -v $(pwd):/runtime \
  -it mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet-buildtools/prereqs:alpine-3.14-WithNode-20210812132848-d90babf \
  /runtime/src/coreclr/build-runtime.sh checked x64
```

but on CI it was failing to find python while it is clearly there, but when i worked around it, it is now failing with `Failed to get PGO data package path`. There is nothing in logs pointing to clues what's wrong, so it might be something specific to pipeline YAML that needs updating?"
"> It picks the same baseline for x64/x86/arm/arm64...so all the diffs are related to that baseline. The question is why it picked wrong baseline, perhaps we didn't catch up or something in jitrollingbuild? @github - any idea?

The jitrollingbuild pipeline is set to build every time the JIT changes, and not batch changes:

```
trigger:
  batch: false
  branches:
    include:
    - main
  paths:
    include:
    - src/coreclr/jit/*
    - src/coreclr/inc/jiteeversionguid.h
```

However, it appears that AzDO doesn't kick off the build immediately; I noticed a delay of about 10 minutes for this particular change. In a few previous cases for JIT changes, there were also delays before the AzDO job kicked off, and in those cases, another change was merged before the kickoff, and AzDO built that change, not the JIT change that kicked off the job. Because of this, when we upload the JIT to Azure Storage, we use a git hash of a non-JIT change, and when superpmi.py looks for a baseline JIT, it doesn't find the hash of the JIT that should have been built.

Summary: there is an assumption that the pipeline builds every JIT change at the git hash of the JIT change. That doesn't appear to be the case with AzDO. I'm not sure if there's a config to force that to happen. E.g., what if 2 JIT changes were merged at almost exactly the same time? AzDO should build both of them, but does it?

Possibly we could change the jitrollingbuild.py upload script to walk back the `git log` for the built change and use the first hash that actually has JIT changes in it, to work around this problem.
"
"> I'm not opposed to this change as this improves build time and also the confusion around what should I use when I have a single target framework in a project within the dotnet/runtime repository. The only concern that I have is that the only validation to avoid usage of these properties will be either a wrong compilation (which might drive people nuts to not understand why the right code is not compiled) or PR Review... but I guess it is fine and people can get use to using TargetPlatformIdentifier.

Correct. Such a change will impact developers and it needs clear documentation and communication. This change makes sure all usages of the `Targets*` properties are replaced correctly with `TPI` conditions. The motivation for this change is:
1. Allow libraries projects to efficiently/correctly target a single target framework. Today it's not possible for projects to use 
`TargetFramework` over `TargetFrameworks` even when only a single target framework is used: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/47155. Because of that, we add ~250 project outer-build evaluations (100ms in average per outer build) to the overall build. These evaluations impact both incremental restore, incremental build and the overall build.
2. It makes dotnet/runtime libraries use the same common path as our customers when a project needs to condition on platforms.
3. Tooling works best when we don't rely on global properties being set. Today, the `Targets*` properties rely on the `TargetFramework` property being passed in globally during the dispatch from an outer to the inner builds. During design time builds and eventually in other scenarios, the TargetFramework property isn't passed in globally and instead is dynamically injected after the first project's property group. This change will avoid the dependency on the global property and will better support tooling like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. Nasty hacks like https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/04bb6eb3f182c934466af9c6f3d5a9ce8efdf716/eng/BeforeTargetFrameworkInference.targets#L3 can be removed entirely.

> Also it is a bummer that to condition for properties we have to now use [MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier to get the TPI value, but for items we can directly access the TPI property. I think while this brings value, this will bring some confusion to the table as the Targets* properties are/where simpler as you didn't have to think much about when/where to use them vs now if I want to use it to condition a property I need to do a ""more"" complicated condition by calling an MSBuild function to get the TPI value.

The idea is that properties use `TPI` to condition on specific platforms (see PR changes) but whenever that's the case, a boilerplate line that initially sets the `TPI` property must be present. It's boilerplate, yes but I don't think it can be avoided because of msbuild's evaluation order. I don't see any inherent problem with that requirement as long as it's well documented and communicated: 
_""Whenever you want to condition properties on platforms, make sure that the `TargetPlatformIdentifier` property is set (see other projects or docs page).""_

> I'll get an email prepared so that we can merge today but we also need to fix the current build failures.

I was already asleep when you responded. Maybe today? :)

Btw here's the code that logs the PRs that are impacted by this change (including a few false positives which have changes in adjacent lines): https://gist.github.com/ViktorHofer/a69aa2cd8e1bddbfe3bee199a42d681c.

"> How frequently is this pattern used in real apps?

I don't think it's super common (setting affinity itself already isn't super common), but a quick search resulted in a few examples that might be impacted if we get this wrong:

To be clear, I don't think this impacts your change.  But we should follow up to make sure that either ProcessorAffinity already does the right thing (e.g. roundtripping it will always reflect the same processor group), or we use a different API under the covers that will, or we deprecate these members and replace them with ones not based on a 64-core limitation."
"> I had spent some time and implemented HW intrinstics for Min/Max and as asmdiffs shows more regressions I assume I did it wrong. I also couldn't figured it how to force the containment, I've always gotten something like this:

Could you share what C# code you're using to get this. At first glance this looks like it might be a loop and so the relevant data may be getting hoisted.

A simple: `Max(x, y[i])` for `float x` and `float[] y` should be enough to trigger containment here."
"this was wrong but i fixed it "
that's it. that's the fix. replacing Binding by BindingBase. 4 chars. I replaced some statement with pattern matching to obfuscate the stupidest fix ever and so I don't look as dumb as I really am.
"I see you didn't want to hang onto the same element references, but to save me from making mistakes in the future, could you explain why this is wrong to do?

I would have reasoned that, by the time we are on the ""Counter"" page, the `counterDisplay` element instance is going to remain fixed, so it's safe to hold it. Arguably it's even preferable to do so, as it shows we're not doing completely broken things like tearing down the entire UI and recreating it after each click."
Docs are wrong 😆 - I know you already mentioned it was a copy-paste.
Why couldn't there be shared state at a connection level which is propagated to each stream? I feel like having a single encoder per connection is wrong. I'll need to reread the spec to be sure.
Sucks that we have so much duplicated code between this and Http2TestBase: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/master/src/Servers/Kestrel/test/InMemory.FunctionalTests/Http2/Http2TestBase.cs
"It makes decisions about resolving the cert and its intermediates at the wrong layer. This builds the chain, potentially downloads intermediates and more. I'd prefer if that happened in a controlled place. "
Can we make things non-optional?  It makes it super simple for someone to accidently do the wrong thing.  We shoudl probably document all the spots that pass null and explain why that's the right thing to do.
"I was wrong about this. `Path.GetTempFileName` is secure enough. It's created `rw` only for the current user, and only that user can remove the file."
"Oh, i think i see what you're saying.  The logic here is buggy:

https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/f5afdc19c154e9a93561fa66ec013c2cd7730485/src/Features/CSharp/Portable/UsePatternMatching/CSharpAsAndNullCheckDiagnosticAnalyzer.cs#L230-L243

Specifically, because it sees the ```x =```, it assumes that 'x' is always assigned, and thus the change is safe.  But it's not.  Because the right side of the assignment executes first, and will do a read of the unassigned variable.

1. That sucks.  But it's also a very corner case.
2. We could consider fixing it.  Namely that if the reference is the left of an assign, that we have to ensure that the right side is fine as well.  Annoying, but doable."

I think that the only thing this function should do, it to check return type of the predicate (bool) in addition to the method's name and number of parameters. We might also want to check that the parameter type of the predicate matches what we believe the element type is supposed to be in this part of the query, but we are not even trying to check this aspect right now, that is fine if that is intentional choice.

"> Multiple ICustomMarshaler implementations don't return null or won't accept null. Many do.

The thing is, it doesn't matter as much that many do: it matters more that some don't.  The whole point of nullable annotations is to issue warnings when a caller is doing something that might result in unexpected failure to due nulls being passed as arguments when the callee didn't allow them, or when the caller assumes null won't be returned but the callee may return null.  If our goal was to avoid warnings, we could just disable nullable annotations altogether, problem solved :)

If I have an interface that defines an argument as nullable, callers of that method can expect they can pass in null and it'll be fine, but if implementers of that method then don't accept null, either they've violated the contract, or the contract was wrong.  It's hard in cases like this one where the contract wasn't clear and we then have to infer what it was meant to be and the harm that may come if we get it wrong.  When in doubt, we typically err on the side of providing the most restrictive for arguments (non-nullable) and most permissive for return values (nullable) because that more accurately represents to callers the contraints they need to work under, that an implementation may not accept nulls, so be careful, and an implementation may return null, so be careful.  We do that because _typically_ there are orders of magnitude more callers of a given override / interface implementation than there are implementers of it.  It's the reason nullable annotations exist, to help flag for a dev when something unexpected might happen.

This changes things, in that the claim is basically saying ""we control all the callers that matter"", yes?

"I do believe that check is right, at least from the perspective of the Intel manual. 3.4.1.1 of the volume on Basic Architecture states:

When in 64-bit mode, operand size determines the number of valid bits in the destination general-purpose

• 64-bit operands generate a 64-bit result in the destination general-purpose register.
• 32-bit operands generate a 32-bit result, zero-extended to a 64-bit result in the destination general-purpose
register.
• 8-bit and 16-bit operands generate an 8-bit or 16-bit result. The upper 56 bits or 48 bits (respectively) of the
destination general-purpose register are not modified by the operation. If the result of an 8-bit or 16-bit
operation is intended for 64-bit address calculation, explicitly sign-extend the register to the full 64-bits.

You are right, the root cause of this issue is that for `,` `argumentCount` increases to `1`. However, for string context `""/**/""` it should be ignored.

https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/1fe9bfdd0ee0ecf9dff23a40c0066645719e46b9/src/services/signatureHelp.ts#L390-L392

I had two options for how to fix this issue: 1. Add changes to `stringCompletions`, to decrement `argumentCount` which has `,`; 2. Change logic in `SignatureHelp` for `getArgumentInfoForCompletions` (I though about additional context option). `getArgumentInfoForCompletions` shared between `stringCompletions` and `completions`, and it seems incrementing `argumentCount` is reasonable here.

https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/1fe9bfdd0ee0ecf9dff23a40c0066645719e46b9/src/services/completions.ts#L1597-L1600

If the current changes are unacceptable, we can fix the issue using one of the following ways: 1. add an additional parameter to `getArgumentInfoForCompletions` and pass it to all chain of dependencies, or 2. directly in `getArgumentOrParameterListInfo`/`getArgumentCount` check if the position is located in the string (`isInString`). @github What do you think?

I was worried about that, but this won't contribute to determining if a function is ""unique"". The only thing used is the ""method identity"", which is (1) the IL code, (2) the method signature + calling convention + CorInfoOptions + hot/cold region + jit flags + ISA flags.

SPMI basically assumes that if the (salient) ""input"" to the JIT is the same, it will produce the same output. It's possible there are other inputs that could affect the output, like the assembly, but it's possibly a trade-off between precision and SPMI MCH file size and useful difference of MCs.

> Just that I know how to use this, can you give an example use-case? Can we use this with /dumpMap , etc?

I thought about adding it to `-dumpMap`. We do get multiple entries, which I believe is when we are considering inlining cross-module. E.g.,

```
GetAssemblyName - 5
0-GetAssemblyName assem-0000027B5D2F2700, value-28 'System.Private.CoreLib'
1-GetAssemblyName assem-0000027B5ED42E30, value-55 'System.Diagnostics.Process'
2-GetAssemblyName assem-0000027B7F8E25A0, value-86 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation'
3-GetAssemblyName assem-0000027B5ED417B0, value-140 'System.ComponentModel.Primitives'
4-GetAssemblyName assem-0000027B5ED42DB0, value-4 'Coreclr.TestWrapper'
```
(for `CoreclrTestLib.CoreclrTestWrapperLib:RunTest(ref,ref,ref,ref,ref):int:this`)

So we'd need a way to figure out which is the ""root"" assembly name to make outputting a single ""-dumpMap"" entry valuable.

> Does this work out ok for the unusual cases like stubs, LGC, etc...?

Are you worried that one of getAssemblyName / getModuleAssembly / getClassModule will fail in these cases (and spmi will crash)? I tried to make repGetAssemblyName() resilient to missing info. The others _should_ also be resilient to garbage, but I could be wrong. I can certainly trigger a collection on this PR and see what we get (beyond what I tested locally). Would we see these things in crossgen? crossgen2? PMI? benchmark run? all of the above?

It's quite possible that these specialized extension methods were only intended to be a temporary step, and have long since ceased to be needed. **But the other possiblity is something more subtle,** like maybe they change how the overload resolution works in order to produce better compiler error messages in cases where people provide incorrect types, or maybe they are only intended to influence intellisense in the design-time code or something. It's hard to say since this build (without those extension methods) and its tests passes.

If anyone here feels they know whether these extension methods or needed, or has a suggestion about how to determine that, please say so :) Since they are public, it's debatable whether we should obsolete them, remove them, or leave them alone, but regardless I'd still like to know what they are for and whether custom event args will somehow behave less well due to not having equivalent extension methods.

IMO the tests using `Assert.Throws` instead of `Assert.ThrowsAny` are generally wrong unless the exception type is sealed.

"This was broken before, but this is not the fix. The 0 byte read from the stream needs to cause PipeReader.ReadAsync to return a ReadResult with IsCompleted set to true.

This change does that, but in the wrong way. This calls PipeReader.Complete() which sets _isCompleted and causes IsCompletedOrThrow() to return true below.

The problem is this is conflating two types of completion. You need two completion flags: one for writer completion and one for reader completion.

PipeReader.Complete() should only be called by the *reader* once the read loop is completed. On the other hand, ReadResult.IsCompleted should only return true when the *writer* is completed. In this case, that's when Stream.ReadAsync() returns 0. 

Additionally, if PipeReader.AdvanceTo() is called after PipeReader.Complete(), which would likely happen with the completion of every Stream with this change left as is, PipeReader.AdvanceTo() is supposed to throw."

Considering how perf-critical is this low-level part of rendering, we wouldn't want penalize people using `.razor` to produce normal components by introduce extra checking logic for cases that a valid `.razor` component could never trigger.

"So, again, you should put in the assert if you are making a strong claim that this is a *Requirement* of this method. i.e. if it would be a bug somewhere for someone to call this method on the BG thread, we should put in an 'assertisforeground'.  Similarly, if it's a bug to be called on the UI thread, then we shoudl hve an 'assertisbackground'.  if it's fine to be called on any thread, it should have an 'CanBeCalledOnAnyThread' call in it.  This is most important for sync methods.

The complaints about the asserts before was that the asserts were *wrong*.  Specifically, we were putting in assertisforeground in methods that should not require being called on the FG.  Async mehods, in particular, should be written to be callable by any thread thread (occasionally there are good reasons thsi can't be). If they then *need* to jump to the FG, they should make the appropriate jump (though, really, only if they're JTF ready, as this is super dangerous otherwise).  

So, i would boil it down to:

1. your async methods should likely not require FG/BG.  If they have an assert, it should be 'CanBeCalledOnAnyThread'.  Then, they bounce to whatever thread is appropriate for them.  i.e. GetDesciption should bounce to the BG since it can be super expensive. 
2. your sync methods *in complex multithreading code* should have asserts about if they should be called on fg, bg, or any thread.  This documents our exepctations, and throws when we get things wrong. #Resolved"

"you are mixing the concepts of the Invariant mode and the Invariant Cultures. these are 2 different things. the code you have pointed is just returning the read only Invariant (culture DTFI). this doesn't mean if anyone else created a new read/write Invariant culture in the Invariant mode cannot set the calendar. this check looks wrong to me and we should allow setting the calendar and not throwing in such case.

"@github Thanks for the reply. 

> and I want to make sure you don't feel like we are just dismissing this opinion.

I don't feel like anyone is dismissing my opinion.  You guys have been great.   I understand that we are in forming/storming stage.  All good.

> Updating our code to modern standards has been a long and arduous journey, but we're definitely not all there yet (evidently). I think where we're mostly coming from is a very Windows-centric mindset, where we have a huge codebase with varying styles across all of it.

Too funny.  I am in the same boat.  I have been a working a large legacy windows-centric code base for a long time.   A few years ago we decided to go cross platform and start to update to Modern C++.   So we were in the same boat.  It has been a long road and obviously when you have millions of lines of code you can't clean it all up at once.   We started with a similar set of rules like you.  ""keep the code consistent, .....""  What we found was doing this is almost impossible.  It is really hard to say ""follow these guidelines for this code"" and ""follow these for this code"".   

In a nutshell this is what helped us get there.
1. Have a style guide and follow it for _all new and modified_ code.  The more detail the better.
I mean really follow it.  :)  This sounds funny but until everyone commits to it and understands it you will have issues. All devs/reviewers need to understand the Core guidelines (or whatever your coding standards are)  - this takes some time to get there but it is doable.

2. Compile with all Major compilers - Clang has great sanitizers, better warnings, etc...

3. Use clang-format! This will save a huge amount of time.  No more - oh you have an extra line here, you have the braces in the wrong spot, etc...  Also, be OK if it is not exactly the same as what you do now.  Believe me, it is worth it.

4. Setup external tools like the CppCoreGuilines analyzer / static analyzer - this sounds great but with a large code base, it is difficult to run the analyzer and fix them all.   In this repo you may be able to do that.  The terminal codebase isn't that large.

5. Document -  Contributing.md, style guide, Do's / Dont's, etc.  If everyone knows what the rules are then everyone will be more productive.  Also realize the community doesn't have the years of backstory that msft devs have.  (this is easy to forget)  Doing a good job of this will pay huge dividends.      

> There's #890, which is probably a good thread to copy most of this commentary into.

I opened this.   👍  For this repo to be successful this stuff is a must.  

You guys seem to have a good start on this and @github has a lot of this on his list. So you guys are on the right track.  I'm looking forward to watching this repo mature.

"Analyzers, CodeFixes and corresponding unit test projects are empty shared projects that were split out from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/41363. That PR moves a few IDE analyzers, code fixers and their unit tests into each of these projects. I would suggest checking out my branch from that PR to locally see the structure.

> The problem here is that the CodeStyle.Fixes project references the CodeStyle project and the WorkspaceExtensions project. So there's now an ambiguity because types get pulled in through two paths.

I hit exactly the same problem, see my comment here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/41363/files#r376442419. In that PR I have moved all the public Option related types that are explicitly linked into CodeStyle project for analyzers (such as OptionSet, IOption, `Option<T>`, CodeStyleOption, CodeStyleOptions, NotificationOptions, etc.) into a separate namespace with an `.Internal` sub-namespace so that files in WorkspaceExtensions.shproj can appropriately reference the types from CodeStyle project or from Workspaces project when imported in the respective projects by having using statements conditioned on `CODE_STYLE` preprocessor directive. This is unfortunate side-effect of the fact that our IDE analyzers need to reference these types, but cannot reference Workspaces. I don't see a good way around this except the approach I have taken in that PR.
Note that Sam has been using extern aliases to handle similar conflicts in shared formatter code, but we cannot do so for the entire Code Style layer because VB does not support them, and personally I find them quite difficult to fathom. I'd rather have the duplicated types in CodeStyle layer be duplicated into a separate namespace.
My PR also adds a `BannedSymbols.txt` for CodeStyle layer: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/41363/files#diff-8747d0acadea5b353b1871784c14003c.

"@github I am very confident about fix (1); the manual advancement of the scanner before was just wrong, and in a confusing way.
Fix (2) has a lot of moving parts, so I'm less confident about it.

Some additional considerations:
- Our JSX test coverage has a similar character to our other tests, but more so: there's a fair amount of JSX but it doesn't cover cases you'd encounter in incomplete programs that well; most of the tests I wrote for this PR are not redundant with existing baselines.
- Both changes only apply in ""non-expression context"" (I don't know if there's another name for ""in JSX text, nested inside JSX elements"") so in theory they're less likely to cause problems outside.
- JSX parsing has been this bad for a long time, so fixing it is not urgent.

That was one of my original approaches, but Android still uses several Interop files in the src/libraries/Common/src/Interop/Unix directory (Dllimports into `CryptoNative_`), which would require splitting those files into the src/libraries/Common/src/Interop/Android directory as well, thus creating duplicate files. Renaming `CryptoNative` is more efficient in that it takes advantage of shared entrypoint names but is definitely more ambiguous and harder to catch. I suppose in the long run it's better to make the split between Android and Unix more distinct?

It does work with relative paths, only the path in REPL appear different (I had some other issue at the time, couldn't reproduce it).

"> I have thought that the packaging tools somehow extract the list of dependencies from the compiled binaries automatically when creating the package, but I guess I was wrong.

You are absolutely correct, actually. Tools like `rpmbuild` in particular, do a scan (I think just a plain old `ldd`) and add everything listed as an automatic dependency. It makes it much easier for the package manager (eg, `dnf`) at install time to then see that ""package X needs `libssl.so.1.1`"" and then install the OpenSSL package that provides the exact maching `libssl.so.1.1`, or otherwise error out at install time with a message about missing dependency. 

AIUI, Debian uses `Depends: {shlibs:Depends}` to implement a similar solution. Similar features for dependency-autogeneration or auto-detection exist in [ArchLinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Creating_packages#Checking_package_sanity) and even [Alpine](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/APKBUILD_Reference#options).

IIRC, that was the primary motivation of my request for a build mode that would link everything dynamically (as in, visible to `ldd`) instead of searching for libs at runtime and using `dlopen`. I had just moved from another project (OpenJDK) where these missing automatic-dependencies would cause programs that would install but would fail at run time with all sorts of unexpected errors.

If we were to revisit this decision, I wonder about this bit that @github wrote:

> This felt like a reasonable mechanism to signify that. The main downside is the RID graph becomes crazy then for nuget and all the restore logic, but for a distro build of the SDK this didn't feel absurd.

Do we really need to couple ""link everything so it's visible to ldd"" with ""needs a new non-portable RID"". What if we used `linux-x64` as the RID, but avoided `dlopen` anyway?

Like mentioned by @github there's a separate knob for using the system foo library (eg, `libunwind`) instead of the copy embedded in .NET that distro packagers may or may not adjust."

"> I am just trying to understand why the code is written this way here. Could you, please, help me out with that?

The compat council's decision means that we do not emit methodimpl in the ambiguous scenarios unless supported by the runtime. That is the *true* branch of the conditional. The false branch of the conditional simply checks if the runtime's unambiguous override candidate is the same as the language one. Methodimpl works on all runtimes for that scenario as far as I know.

> At first, the logic feels wrong because we might not emit a MethodImpl for true covariant return case with ambiguous runtime override. 

We only support covariant returns when targeting a platform that supports covariant returns. I don't think that needs additional documentation.

> On the other hand, could this negatively affect retargeting scenario when covariant returns involved?

This code is only when emitting the source method, and for the metadata properties of a source method. I don't think it can affect the properties of a retargeting method (which mirror the same metadata properties that would arise on the underlying method if emitted).
I don't think we intend to support retargeting a method that uses covariant returns to a runtime that does not support them. I don't think any small adjustment here could make that work.

I think so. Without any checks there can be scary effects like described in #41146. Even with wrong user code that should not happen.

I was thinking about try/catch. But it won't work for all cases (e.g. assign null to non-nullable value-typed member) where the non-emitting reflection code doesn't throw but silently changes null to default(T) - but maybe that's desirable?. It would be difficult to get the right exceptions because reflection code and emitted code throw different exceptions.   "

"Yup. I couldn't see a good way of making the behavior match. I don't think there's anything wrong with fetching an AssemblyName, so I don't think that should throw, but since the AssemblyName doesn't have a pointer back to the Assembly there's no way to hook just the CodeBase API, aside from doing something drastic like subclassing AssemblyName just for this scenario.

It's a shame Windows Explorer doesn't appear to know how to render that character. I'm not sure how it _could_ but even so. (Edit: ~~perhaps I'm being dumb, and the middle-dot _is_ a rendering for this character. I had assumed it was a 'unknown character' marker...~~ Other random PUA characters render the same.)

What happens if you use the character `` in a filename inside WSL? ^_^

Edit: I tested this, because I was curious. It's ending up at `\` on disk, i.e. the characters `\` and `` in WSL2 both end up as `\` on-disk under `/mnt/c/` (i.e. via the mount from Windows), and in Windows all are shown as as ``. On the Windows side, only `` can be used, and it appears back as `\` on the WSL side. On the Linux-local filesystem, `\` and `` are separate files, but _both_ appear as `` when accessed through the `\\wsl$` UNC path in Windows Explorer. At that point, things go a little weird (renaming a file or folder with `` reports ""file is too big for the disk""), so probably avoid using literal `` inside WSL."

FWIW, replacing files in all the right places is overwhelming, and after spending enough time playing trial and error with msbuild verbose logs, it still didn't work for me (i.e. nuget cache was hit or wrong bin folder got picked up during one of the build/pack step and ended up testing the [wrong binary](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/67232#issuecomment-1090036551)). Not an msbuild expert ™️ so I might have missed something if it is supposed to just work that way (with reasonable number of steps). 😅

To unblock myself, I ended up with somewhat of a hammer solution, i.e. clear all kinds of local package caches, add local folder in nuget.config etc. using the following zsh script (`~/projects/customaot.sh`) on osx-arm64 (which takes about 15 minutes on M1 mac to build the whole toolchain E2E and compile a simple hello world app with that custom built toolchain):

```zsh
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

set +e

# ~/update-daily-dotnet7.sh

alias dotnet7=~/.dotnet7/dotnet

# Created a hello world app with dotnet7 new console -o ~/projects/naot1, with
# NuGet.config containing .NET 7 preview sources.
#
# Next:
# 1. in ~/projects/runtime:

#        line to 1.0.0-dev

## Note - information below is false and I am only keeping it for history.

@github - This function is causing tsconfig references to fail to load right now in yarn `3.0.0`. pnpApi always seems to return the project root when `path` is absolute and lies within the `workspace:.` path. This is causing tsconfig.json files with referenced config json files within the workspace, to be invalid, only in tsserver somehow.

I tried and succeeded in fixing this issue locally by unplugging typescript and making a slight modification to this function -

```ts
const getPnpPath = (path: string) => {
    if (pathIsAbsolute(path)) return path; // intended compiled code - `if (ts.pathIsAbsolute(path)) return path;`
    try {
        const targetLocator = pnpApi.findPackageLocator(`${path}/`);
        return pnpApi.resolveToUnqualified(targetLocator.name, `${basePath}/`);
    } catch {
        // something went wrong with the resolution, try not to fail
        return path;
    }
};

It seems to be a legit operation if e.g. `T extends **object** ? keyof T : never` instead of `T extends [some union]/ unknown ? keyof T : never`.

So my working solution is to guard against return `IndexType` if the above conditions are met.

I place the logic at `getTrueTypeFromConditionalType`.

However, I am quite new to this and I am not quite sure:

1. that `getTrueTypeFromConditionalType` is the right place to place the logic; and
2. what is the right type to return in place of `IndexType` (I am returning `UnknownType`)

Please do give me a few pointers whether I am approaching this correctly.

"> Well... that path would be the only one that works if you have a non-exportable key stored in a keychain. Since we don't expose the Apple interop types as public API the only way to get one of those is from GetECDsaPrivateKey(). (Which, basically limits the scenario to ""I want to renew/regen a cert with the same key"", I suppose)

I had the same line of thinking and went back and forth with striking the option from the list :-) Eventually I left it there to paint the full picture so someone without sleep deprivation can re-read it...

> Thanks for the workaround code. I don't like duplicating the logic of the ""internal representation"" of Apple EC keys, but I think I see a path forward from that.

Not a big fan of it myself but I wanted to unblock the PR.

I've tried to implement other options from the list but they were quite a big mess. The iOS-style keys only support X.963 format export, the legacy `SecItemExport` API doesn't work for them at all. That basically ruled out handling the situation in native code because it would get too complex. So next best thing is handling it in the managed part of the code and taking different path for iOS-style keys and the CSSM ones. The key type can be inferred by calling `SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation`, fails for CSSM keys and succeeds for iOS-style ones. It's a relatively cheap call that just copies an array but it felt wrong to just throw away the array."

"After consideration, I think we should not name the new option after the package version number, because:

1. This is going in a patch, so the version would be something like `RoutingBehavior_5_0_1` which is ridiculously ugly to put in the default template
2. We can’t really use a name like `Current` because theoretically there could be an even newer incompatible version in the future

My proposal here of calling it `PreferExactMatches` has the benefits:

* It doesn't look particularly unpleasant in the default template. It sounds like a good thing, which it is.
* Even after we retire the option in 6.0 and remove it from intellisense, we can continue to allow people to pass  `PreferExactMatches=""true""` (that just becomes a no-op, whereas `PreferExactMatches=""false""` becomes an error). It doesn't make anyone's code look wrong to have this still in it, plus it doesn't imply the person *only* wants 5.0.1 behaviors and not newer ones
* If we ever need to fork the logic again, we can use the same pattern of naming the new option after its own behavior, and that's independent of this."

"> The indentation is always correct at 4 spaces (the only real exception in C# code is LINQ queries). Others are occasionally acceptable as well, but 4 spaces is never wrong.

Indentation of subexpressions within parenthesized expressions should align.  Otherwise you end up with code that is **super** confusing.  Is the subsequent boolean clause a sibling of the first preceding clause?  Or is it a sibling of a nested clause?  i.e.  when i see:

```c#
if (!(a...
    && b
```

my brain immediately starts pulling this apart as   ```!(a...```  as one clause and ```b``` as hte other. Alignment across lines is *very* often used to indicate structural association.  

But that's not hte case here.  ```&& b``` is associated with ```a``` and the ```!``` affects all of it. 

This is one of hte reasons i often push on people to not create overly complex boolean expressions as they end up hard to parse and hard to maintain over time.  To me, i would prefer something like:

```c#
if (!(n is ...
      id...)
```

Or, alternatively, just do:

```c#
var identifierNameMatches = n is IdentifierNameSyntax id && id.Identifier.ValueText.Equals(identifier.ValueText);
if (!identifierNameMatches)
{
...
```"

"this looks wrong.  not properly picking up ""empty token"" for some reason.  will investigate."
"I thought about it again and realized that I didn't do a detailed explaination for the tokenization idea, sorry for that.

The reason that we can use `isCheapToTokenize` to reduce the time is there are always tokens generated for the viewport (introduced by Alex's recent changes). Whenever we open a file, scroll to some pages, we will tokenize the viewport based on some heuristics. It doesn't mean they are 100% correct, but almost. So if the viewport is cheap to tokenize, then we force tokenize them. If not, we don't do anything, just read the tokens by `getLineTokens`.
 
`isCheapToTokenize` is `false` in following two major cases

1. if the previous line of a position is not tokenized or invalid (for example, it has dirty changes)
2. if current line is really long

So say you debug into a new file, the editor tokenizes the viewport internally (99.9% correct), and then start a full document tokenization in the background. If now you ask the editor if the viewport is cheap to tokenize or not, it depends on how fast the background tokenization runs.

Since we are only fetching `word` information here, there are fewer chances that the tokens are siganificantly wrong. I'd like to propose

* Check if the `visibleRange.startLineNumber` is easy to tokenize or not
* If so, tokenize the viewport only. (We don't need to `tokenizeCompleteDocument` as there is already a background job for that)
* If not, just read the tokens, they are very unlikely to be wrong, for word information"

"> What problem are you trying to solve?

To undo any changes running inline has on the sync context.

> Would that opaque struct help with the ASP.NET use case in some way?

It would help with `MRVTSC` because it wouldn't need to mess with sync context directly.

It wouldn't help with ASP.NET because it doesn't care about the return value (it's one way, just trying to restore single previously captured context) or the sync context.

Whereas `MRVTSC` does operate as a stack; restore captured context, do work, restore current context.

ASP.NET is more: do work, restore context (because I don't trust the work to guard asynclocal changes inside `await`s); i.e. restore clean context at end of request loop ready for next request (and there are two examples of it going wrong this way dotnet/aspnetcore#15384 and dotnet/aspnetcore#13991)

The current ASP.NET solution is to move the 3 user calls out behind a new `async` method and let `AsyncMethodBuilderCore.Start<TStateMachine>` handle returning the ExecutionContext back to default.

However, that both introduces a new async statemachine and an extra allocation if any of the methods suspend and its a bit heavyweight just to reset the EC. 

So next thought would be to guard them with `EC.Run`; but then what Task to return and await, since there are 3 of them; if they all complete sync, then can in some way return a CompletedTask; but that's complicated since its callback based (e.g. via the `ref` param); but if one goes async other than the very last one, suddenly it becomes complicated; etc.

If there is a `EC.Restore` on the other hand, can just inline all the awaits into the single method; and don't need an extra startmachine to handle resetting the EC at end of request and don't allocate anything extra if they suspend (since the loop statemachine is already allocated as it likely suspends between requests waiting for the next one)

2. I was able to make `Logs` readonly inside `CrashReportSnapshot` because it is only assigned in ctor so it never changes
3. Then we read the value back here but it's the same `Logs` we pass in so I didn't change anything and we already do what you are saying. Or I am wrong somehow?

"> I'm gonna go ahead and ask the dumb question: Why can't we _automatically_ derive the constraint of an inferred type binding from the constraint of the type being matched?

We do have automatic inference, and there are ways we can improve it. However, that still wouldn't solve the issue at hand. There are times where you need a more-specific type than what the inferred constraint might allow:

```ts
type X<T extends any[]> =
  T extends [infer U extends string, ...infer R] ? ... :
  T extends [infer U extends number, ...infer R] ? ... :
  ...;

Above, I might want to make branching decisions based on a more specific constraint. This also ties into #48094, which uses more specific inferences for `infer` in a template literal type to pull out numeric literals. "

"@github @github @github I need your feedback on an issue I am seeing in the test run regarding the change here. If we have the following code and running it without my changes:

```C#
            var attribute = new TimersDescriptionAttribute(null!); // passing null for description
            string s = null;
            try {s = attribute.Description; } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine($""{e.Message}""); } // accessing attribute.Description first time throw argument null exception
            s = attribute.Description; // access it second time will not throw :-(
``` 

This is happening because of the code https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/8e624b33465546e9d05da2afea5faea233d9f847/src/libraries/System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter/src/System/Timers/TimersDescriptionAttribute.cs#L40 We are calling `SR.Format(string)` which will call [internal static string Format(string resourceFormat, params object?[]? args)](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/8e624b33465546e9d05da2afea5faea233d9f847/src/libraries/Common/src/System/SR.cs#L78) passing empty args array and then later will throw when trying to format the string. 
With my changes, I removed the `SR.Format` as @github suggested and now we are not throwing it at all. Obviously, the current behavior is wrong. we have the following options:
- Throw in the attribute constructor when passing null parameter. This is the option I prefer. 
- Don't throw at all and allow `null` description. This is the behavior with current changes.
- Keep the current behavior which throw first time trying to access the description and never throw again.

What you think?"
@github how about implementing a reference counter? If I'm not wrong `Comet` has this implemented. If that's a simple implementation we can add this to .NET MAUI and call the `DisconnectHandler` when we don't have anymore references at all.

"I've looked at all the places where equals could be used, the only places that take user input are the DisconnectCircuitMiddleware and ConnectAsync inside the CircuitRegistry, in both cases we do validation of the ID first, so further uses of method are fine.

That said, I think in principle we should change this to use the hash of the circuit for a couple of important benefits:
* We always have a way of going from Secret to ID, which guarantees that a secret and its ID are always paired and there are never mismatches or can be easily detected. (The ID becomes a computed field). This allows us to log based on the ID in all circumstances.
  * No need to enable tracing in logging (which our customers are likely to get wrong and spam their logs with all traces for the server, for example Kestrel will log all the bytes coming in and out). As to do this selectively you would need to use a filter, which is somewhat advanced.
* It allows us to use the ID in all circumstances to do lookups and other operations and allows a safe implementation for Equals and GetHashCode in this type, as even if you are able to figure out the hash for a secret, you don't learn any information about the secret itself (Thanks to hashing being a one way function)."
"I put the logging before Abort and as you said I need to make some changes on DisconnectToken.

I used this code

```
CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
string address;
using (Utilities.CreateHttpServer(out address, async httpContext =>
{
    httpContext.Response.Headers[""Content-length""] = "" 30 "";
    await httpContext.Response.Body.WriteAsync(new byte[10], 0, 10);
    cts.Cancel();
}))
{
    using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
    {
        await client.GetAsync(address, cts.Token);

I would get the correct cancellation token, but I couldn't figure out what condition I should add or remove from if statement, to make this work.

What I'm about to suggest is probably wrong since it changes the result on this test

"> Instead of validating the contents of the cache when we download bits from the network, can we validate them when we load them from the cache?

That seems strictly worse to me. We're then doing the hash check on every load instead of only when the data was first acquired. We still have to do it on the first load when it comes from the network too (see below).

> It is very unlikely that you end up in a situation where the manifest doesn't reflect the contents of the server or that you can't trust the manifest (it's your app, you are serving it).

It will certainly happen sometimes. It's always possible during deployments that a user fetches `blazor.boot.json` from the old version of the site and some assemblies from the new version.

> Worst case scenario, your app is in the middle of a deployment and you got the wrong contents, the likely outcome is that your app will crash and the user will have to reload (this problem is orthogonal to what we are trying here)

Doesn't seem like an orthogonal problem to me. The scenario this code deals with is acquiring the resources and verifying they are the ones we want. I don't see any benefit in letting the app start up with the wrong resources, performing whatever undefined behavior this leads to for some period, and then hoping we can shut it down later and hope we get to run more logic to clean up the polluted cache.

> If you want to do this validation, then do it over the cached data the first time you load from cache and ""repair"" purge the entry from the dll once you detect that scenario.

I definitely think we should validate the data the first time it comes from the network, for the reasons mentioned above. And then having done that and cached it under a key derived from that hash, there's no purpose in revalidating it again later."

"> Do you know why it is that System.Runtime.dll and netstandard.dll are unifying here? Is there a type-forwarding situation going on?

Yes, this is type-forwarding. For netstandard from netframework (or even netcore) reference binaries are added to do type-forwarding so `netstandard.dll` types can resolve to the equivalent type. I had an easier time viewing this in netframework build outputs. One of the referenced files is `{VsInstallPath}\MSBuild\Microsoft\Microsoft.NET.Build.Extensions\net461\lib\netstandard.dll` which contains all of the type forwarding. I'm not quite sure how it's done with netcore (I didn't look heavily), but I imagine there's something similar. 

> I guess my poitn is this. If we are considreing these symbols from different compilations equivalent (which seems to be how the compiler would view things), then we should update our helper to properly encode the right logic that makes it agree with what the compiler would think. I don't think that's necessarily IgnoreAssembliesInstance, however it might be something else.

This IS that something else. Is it just that it's not part of statics exposed by `SymbolEquivalenceComparer`? 

To me this is just swapping the wrong call to the right one. If the logic isn't in the right place, then I guess moving it would be okay? I don't feel strongly one way or another. 

I think `SymbolEquivalenceComparer` does the advertised thing and works in the expected way; you compare with a requirement for same assemblies or you compare without. I'd even be willing to move this code to calling it directly. Like I said, I just chose an example from something similar and went with it because it looked like `SymbolEquivalenceComparer` + some extra checks to ensure type forwarding is considered. "

"Using a TFM which targets a specific runtime versus netstandard is not the same thing as treating classlib and app the same way. As you note it was always possible to target classlib for a specific runtime, that's not the limitation. The limitation is that SDK simply doesn't officially support building SCD classlib projects. In a way even `dotnet publish` is sort of weird on a classlib (and has several really weird behaviors). All of this is mostly because nobody went and made sure that SDK has this scenario cleaned up. Introducing support for this in the hosting layer feels wrong if we don't have a good story how to build such a thing.

You're right that we might need to block one of the other supported delegates from this new scenario. But most of them should work. There's a separate question if we should support them there - as COM/WinRT/IJW should never run into the new scenario as those entry points will always go through the `hostfxr_initialize_for_runtime_config`. So maybe it would be better to block those cases (just to avoid having to support weird configurations into the future).

I don't think the block in `hostfxr_initialize_for_runtime_config` is artificial. Removing it is actually quite a bit of new work if we were to support comparable behavior to FDD. Currently this entry point ""promises"" to not load any application code into the default ALC (to avoid version collisions with potential future loaded components). If we were to maintain that promise we would have to implement the split between app/framework assemblies for SCD (per our other discussion - the `runtimepack` value) and split loading that way. On top of that we would have to support then loading what looks like an SCD component into a secondary load context - currently `AssemblyDependencyResolver` assumes that files next to the component being loaded (and mentioned in its `.deps.json`) are part of the component - but for SCD this would be true for the entire framework. So we would have also implement the support for recognizing framework assemblies in `AssemblyDependencyResolver` (this would be a good thing but still more work). I must also admit I'm a bit hesitant to go this way yet, as it would effectively mean splitting SCD into two halves and there might be small behavior differences which show up. Since this is not a primary scenario for us in .NET 5 (we don't have resources to put into this right now) I want to avoid opening too many new scenarios as there's always a bug tail to be fixed. I'm not against doing this in the future though.

Alternative would be to say that when used on SCD it populates the default ALC with the entire app. But then the usage of it would be quite different. Using the existing entry points which all load into secondary ALCs would be problematic due to potential duplication of assemblies (as mentioned in the doc already). And it would be rather confusing - calling the same function would rather significantly change behavior based on what is the input (not the parameters to the function). This would potentially open weird scenarios in COM/WinRT/IJW as all these entry points call the `hostfxr_initialize_for_runtime_config` and if given SCD-like input would get the new behavior and at the very least get confused."

">CheckValue [](start = 35, length = 10)

Addition of this call here feels premature and inconsistent with how we deal with binding of a regular member access. Specifically, in case of ```TypeOrValueExpression```:

"Most editors overwrite a file when they save, which requires write sharing. Some (vim?) apparently *delete* an existing file first [1]. In Windows 10+, `DeleteFileW()` has been updated to try a POSIX delete. If the filesystem supports it, already open files can continue accessing the original file, even though it's unlinked from the directory. (NTFS renames the deleted file to the reserved directory ""\\$Extend\\$Deleted"".) If a POSIX delete isn't supported, the file is marked as deleted, but not unlinked, and the name is inaccessible for new opens until all handles for existing opens have been closed. In either case, existing opens have to share delete access. Otherwise `DeleteFileW()` will fail with a sharing violation.

"so this is technically a bit unclean, but *hopefully* not a problem.  THe main issue is that this makes attribute parsing context sensitive.  We generally like avoiding that as it makes incremental difficult.  Specifically, it means we couldn't jsut say ""ah, we can reuse the attributes from a previous parse that are available in this location"".

In your case, i think you're ok.  that's bacause you'll have one of the two cases:

1. the attribute decl is on a lambda before.  so it will have the feature diagnostic on it, so it will crumble if we try to reparse it.
2. the attribute decl is not on a lambda.  it is reused in ParseAttributeDecl, but we still add the diagnostic on afterwards.

This is subtle though and easy to get wrong.  in general, it can be preferable to just do the parse normally and have the caller (i.e. this method) do the check. "

">  Is it because the actual controls don't have a size yet? 

Exactly that. See for example, `Pane::PreCalculateAutoSplit`. During startup, none of the panes have actually been added to the UI tree yet, so they don't have `ActualHeight`/`ActualWidth`s yet. There's some work that we do to try and figure out where the actual positions of panes _will_ be, based off of how big the window is, and roughly how much the pane will take of that window. The math sucks there though, and I was too lazy to try and figure that our for `moveFocus` at this time 😋 "
"> This seems like it would have a significant hit on performance. I could have sworn ConEmu only applied the algorithm to the initial palette initialization, but this looks like it's adjusting the colors on every color lookup in the renderer.

That's a good question; I understood it to be at render time for them as well (otherwise, they need to compute each color's contrast on each background and determine whether to nudge that foreground _only_ on that background or nudge it generally... potentially having to resolve a recursive conflict with other colors?), but I may indeed be wrong.

EDIT: Also, perhaps, to improve the contrast of applications that use true color? I'm not sure whether that is a noble goal.

EDIT 2: However, it might be a noble goal _if_ we want to add a feature for High Contrast users to actually induce high contrast in otherwise intransigent applications. (EDIT 3: Which I do -- that is an accessibility feature that could help people quite a bit!)

yup, that's totally fine (see roslyn for example).  Say i have this:  `public Foo Bar() { }`.  `Foo` is an identifier, but that's definitely a Type context.  In other words *all* identifiers/name can be used where a Type is needed (though not vice versa)."

"That background out of the way, I now don't understand how this PR *works*:  `<GenerateJavaStubs/>` calls `ManifestDocument.Merge()`: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/main/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Tasks/GenerateJavaStubs.cs#L290

`<GenerateJavaStubs/>` also writes out the ""final"" `AndroidManifest.xml` file, and thus is *really* important.

`ManifestDocument.Merge()`, meanwhile: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/9add575ba0e25903b6894f40fcd53e6d51785fae/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Utilities/ManifestDocument.cs#L246-L260

`ManifestDocument.PackageName` is set by `<GenerateJavaStubs/>` as part of `ManifestDocument` construction, and thus ultimately comes from `<GetAndroidPackageName/>`, which is updated by this PR.  So far so good.

However, if `AndroidManifest.xml` *has* `/manifest/@github` value -- which it does for this bug! -- then line 259 *replaces* `ManifestDocument.PackageName` with the `/manifest/@github` value.  `PackageName` is never updated to take `ManifestDocument.Placeholders` into consideration, so my *hypothesis* is that the *actual* `AndroidManifest.xml`'s `/manifest/@github` value is *still* ""wrong"", not containing appropriately updated values.

Based on the unit test, this *should* produce a `com.xamarin.android.a.b-Signed.apk` file.

(Meaning that this PR only really changes the *filename produced*, but not the actual intermediate `AndroidManifest.xml` files.)

If my hypothesis is correct, I believe that the appropriate fix would be to instead update `AndroidAppManifest.CanonicalizePackageName()` to take a `string[] placeholders` parameter, and have *both* `<GetAndroidPackageName/>` and `ManifestDocument.Merge()` call `AndroidAppManifest.CanonicalizePackageName(PackageName, placeholders)`.  (The current `foreach` over the placeholders would likewise move into `AndroidAppManifest.CanonicalizePackageName()`.)"

but it means INVALID_STATE is not only used if ClosedLocally; and it doesn't prevent stream_open from returning it later for some different reason....

On one hand, it will be better if we were able to tell the difference and not just translate INVALID_STATE into OperationAbortedException. This exception now bears the meaning of ""you do something that results in a local operation being aborted, e.g. AbortRead (or close Stream or close Connection) with a pending Read""; if we use it for something else it will become unhelpful... in the same way ""INVALID_STATE"" sounds unhelpful -- something is wrong but you're not sure what.

On the other hand, tracking all we do locally and adding the guards you mention might be too big and complex change, and if it would involve locking, it may significantly impact perf.

I was initially inclined towards not translating INVALID_STATE into OperationAbortedException, but I'm not so sure now.

Other than that one might specialize for short substrings... if that would improve anything.

With `git grep ""enum GC_ALLOC_FLAGS""` which definitely works better than the GitHub search, I only found 2 definitions:

I am currently undecided if we have any shared project for CLR-Tools code and the S.P.CoreLib where this could be added.

Since this is only tools code it will not reduce the assembly size for the user, but code duplication should still be avoided in my opinion.

Maybe we could put this under libraries/Common?"

`IF_DR_2G` `(mov sp/reg, reg/sp)` has an implicit reg2, so an unwary peephole opt
might mistakenly think it is `mov reg, x0`. If the opt is unlucky and the next
instruction is a real `mov reg, x0` the peephole opt might suppress the second
instruction, leaving the wrong value in `reg`.

Fix is to just disallow `IF_DR_2G` in the peephole.

Fixes #68527.

"@github - also FYI on this. Using the package APIs, which are all async, e.g. `GetItemAsync()`, would all throw mysterious C++ exceptions. I wonder if I'm running it on the wrong thread? (Which would be annoying, because nothing else here is async, and calling `GetResult()` is awful.)

"Thanks for the feedback. I'm trying to understand how this is happening. stopConnection is only ever called when the transport fires its closed handlers. You can see where it's wired up here:

https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/88bf14399bb6c3557a73ce1a38ba7d7e9f27ac88/src/SignalR/clients/java/signalr/core/src/main/java/com/microsoft/signalr/HubConnection.java#L276-L279

At the point stopConnection is wired up as the transport's close handler, the ConnectionState is already in scope. That means we can fix any issues with a null ConnectionState here by simply capturing the ConnectionState in the setOnClose lambda and passing the ConnectionState as an argument to stopConnection. That way there's absolutely no risk of referencing the wrong ConnectionState or it being null. You could then verify the passed-in ConnectionState matches what's returned from getConnectionStateUnsynchronized() before calling changeState(HubConnectionState.DISCONNECTED) or mutating anything else outside of the ConnectionState object.

https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/88bf14399bb6c3557a73ce1a38ba7d7e9f27ac88/src/SignalR/clients/java/signalr/core/src/main/java/com/microsoft/signalr/HubConnection.java#L1482-L1487

That said, @github @github Do either of you have any ideas about how ConnectionState could be null here today? As far as I can tell, this is the only method that currently sets ConnectionState to null, and it cannot be called before it's hooked to the transport's close event which happens after the ConnectionState is set.

There are two possibilities I can think of at the moment:

1. The transport triggering stopConnection multiple times for a single connection.
2. The connection starting and stopping twice. If the first call to stopConnection is delayed long enough, the ConnectionState might have been overwritten by the second connection before the first call to stopConnection fires.

I'm thinking instead of just checking the HubConnectionState in start() we should also verify ConnectionState is null before continuing.

https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/88bf14399bb6c3557a73ce1a38ba7d7e9f27ac88/src/SignalR/clients/java/signalr/core/src/main/java/com/microsoft/signalr/HubConnection.java#L224-L234

Looking at all this also has me wondering what happens if transport.start() fails so the transport never fires stopConnection. Is the ConnectionState still cleared? It appears not.

"Separately, the current code here will result in extra noise in the normal (Arcade-ified) case because `msbuild` and `dotnet msbuild` warn when something tries to override a global properties.

`Ms. Build` treats global properties (environment variables and `/p:Foo=Bar` on the command line) as read-only. The  `TreatAsLocalProperty` attribute is an escape hatch from that.

In any case, I'm glad this works but
1. Want to understand how much change introduced this or what else caused the new ""direct build"" issues

I think the `""invertBoolean"": true` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/a0b950fc51c43289ab3c6dbea15926d32f3556cc/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/WebApi-CSharp/.template.config/ide.host.json#L46) really makes this confusing.

I think the alt text for both `DisableOpenAPI` and `UseMinimalAPIs` are wrong because of this `invertBoolean` logic. The alt text for the `UseMinimalAPIs` checkbox is currently ""Whether to use minimal APIs instead of controllers"" when it should probably be ""Whether to use controllers instead of minimal APIs"". It's a little more subtle with this phrasing, but it's essentially the same problem.

While we could just invert the descriptions in the `""type"": ""parameter""` symbol, I think that'd be confusing and wrong considering the inversion is happening in [ide.host.json](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/a0b950fc51c43289ab3c6dbea15926d32f3556cc/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/WebApi-CSharp/.template.config/ide.host.json). Can we move the alt text to that file instead somehow?

@github Gosh; I'm sorry about the wrong item group name! Thanks for figuring that out; I'm glad it's working now.
"Thanks. That caught a bug.
~~That said, the expectations you listed are wrong. Neither of those should be offered. The `var` pattern has different semantics than the pattern with a type (`var` doesn't check for `null`, but type-pattern does).~~

~~Update1:My bad, I see that you accounted for that in your example.
The middle case could be offered. But it's currently not (even prior to my change).~~

Update2: On further reflection, I think my initial reaction was correct. We should leave var patterns alone, because they have different semantics. It's not just that they don't null-test, they also don't type-test."
"<del>note: there are probably other cases that need to be supported, such as a for each statement variable. if you don't implement this, please create an issue so that somebody can fix this later</del> I'm probably wrong. I don't see how this could come up in a for each statement. Are we sure there are no other cases though? #Resolved"

"> This cannot be reverted without adding a warning suppression unless I hard code a new rule for this in the analyzer. Do you have a suggestion for a new global rule that would apply here?

```Is``` and ```IsNot``` operators in VB are explicitly reference comparison. There is nothing wrong in using them and I think analyzer should not complain about them at all. There is no confusion like in C# where ```==``` sometimes means value equality and sometimes means reference equality depending on the types involved.

"Turns out my reading of the code was wrong. We have kept the original behavior (and it's covered by ` RefParameter_TopLevelNullability_Suppressed`). 
If the expression is suppressed, we get a non-null state on the way out, thus no warning from assignment."
"We generally use ArgumentException for this, with a message that conveys what went wrong, e.g. https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/ccada164f3a18207e91f1e3d0dc7c168ae3de0d4/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/FileStream.cs#L341"
"I would make this a top-level/global function and not a member function - to make it clear it's effectively an exported API. Or maybe even better - do the same which hostpolicy already does for functions like `get_delegate` and similar. Those are also effectively exported APIs which are returned as function pointers. Currently they are written as hidden inside an anonymous namespace and don't need header/cpp duplicate declarations.

Also currently the header and cpp have slightly different declarations of the function - which feels wrong. "

"This now feels to me like it is at the wrong layer. Implementors of editors should do the right thing, I would expect the editor service to not have any smarts."
"I think this line is wrong and probably causes the tests failures. 

Suppose you have `isUtf16DataNonAscii[0]` equal to `0xFFFF`  (i.e. `-1`) and `isUtf16DataNonAscii[1]` equal to `0`. Then `MaxPairwise(isUtf16DataNonAscii, isUtf16DataNonAscii)` will return `0` in the 0-the lane of the resulting value.

You need to use `MinPairwise` here. You would use `MaxPairwise` if the element type was unsigned.

This is why I originally suggested to use `MinAcross` for this.

In my reply to Kunal I also assumed the unsigned type of the values (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/39041#discussion_r455225992)"

"It seems that different API / SDK versions behave differently - is there a best practice how to handle that for UI tests? Can I mark tests to only run for specific versions? Should I avoid the hassle and just mark them as ManualReview?

It seems that newer iOS versions are using `UIImageView` for the native bottom badge that's why `SetSectionBadgeUnselectedColorTest` and `SetSectionBadgeColorTest` do not work - don't think there is a possibility to get the color here (prove me wrong).

Lower Android versions are returning `HashMap` for `getColor` instead of `ColorStateList` for the `GradientBackground`, that's why `SetItemBadgeUnselectedColorTest` and `SetItemBadgeColorTest` are failing here. Didn't check if there is an alternative to determine the background color yet.

For all the other failing tests - I don't know what's going on here, but I guess that's not related to the PR?"
"This is all very confusing, and I agree its this isn't a very stable model within the compiler. The problem is that we tend to check for architecture with a simple equality check, and there are quite a few checks (and it would be really easy to get this wrong as we don't actively test this.).

With the abi, as this change is actually specific to the abi, and we don't have many abi checks in the product, this seemed safer and less risky going forward."

"No, that was a conscious decision. Git task derives from ToolTask which is inherently dumb to use when you need to invoke a command more than once - you need to create a state machine so that you can return different parameters from `GenerateCommandLineCommands` and then call `base.Execute()`, then use the state machine again in `LogEventsFromTextOutput` to place the results where they should be.

The P1363 format is the .NET default, r and s as a fixed-length unsigned encoding each as long as the size of the order.

Of course, that would mean you have to split off from ECDsaOpenSsl already, since ECDsaOpenSsl expects the X.509 DER version."
"Yes, the existing test was wrong given the change to the language specification.

We should always produce the same symbols and bind the same way, regardless of language version. The only thing that can differ is what diagnostics are produced.
For example if you used `record struct` in an older language version, we'll still probably produce a symbol with members. But we'll also produce a diagnostic. When you switch to a newer language version, the error merely goes away.

Regarding the present test: the `ToString` member should never be produced when the base type has a sealed `ToString`. But an error should be produced when that happens with a language version which isn't high enough. This test should remain an error in C# 9, but the reason changes (it's no longer because we *can't* handle the situation, it's because we *won't* given the insufficient language version). #Closed"

"Agreeing with @github here: to me I fundamentally expect that Omnisharp isn't doing binding redirects and compiling against one version but supporting another. That would then mean we have to have a much higher compat bar where we have to support that and that's simply not something we've signed up for or have a plan in place for.

If we have to support binding redirects for this layer in a case like is being proposed, then I don't want an Omnisharp External Access layer at *all* because suddenly it means changing any other interface is potentially more expensive than _what we even do for Visual Studio_, and that's crazy."
This is wrong and must be fixed before this is merged.  This can't be stored for reuse until GetResult is called on VTS.

"This API should use `SetFileInformationByHandle` and I think it shouldn't throw for a null `fileHandle.Path`, instead, let the pinvoke decide if something is wrong with the handle.

You could use `SetFileAttributesW` when `fileHandle.Path` is not null but only if SetFileAttributesW shows better performance than SetFileInformationByHandle i.e: as an optimization."
"@github I'm fine with changing this back, but some of this of course relates to `Substring` API and this not ""knowing"" constraints of input, while when span is created, those constraints are in place. So it's not necessarily because something is ""wrong"" with `Substring` but more that inside this context we can side step these checks by using already verified state. If that makes sense. Again this only matters - no big impact though - for very short lines, but this is where we have seen the regressions."

"That was two mixed questions together, one of them is very dumb :)

Remaining question is related to the default value of `PreferTopLevelStatements`. If a brand new project is created, without any `.editorconfig`, this will convert it to `Program.Main` since the default value is to not prefer top-level statements. Isn't this regressing how the new template works?"
"I don't see a valid reason here to keep this suggestion because of the reasons above. As about delegate constraint:
1. VS will prioritize `Delegate` if you are typing `delegate`
2. The fact, that VS doesn't have a `delegate` completion can arouse suspicion in user's mind, that he is doing something wrong.
3. User can still force-type `delegate` against completions and ensure, that this is invalid. He will be provided with a clear error message and a quick fix."
hmm... something might have went wrong in the `xcode12.2` backport to `main`
"Hmm, I hope we won't need to define the platform enumeration in every single test getting converted to the new model, will we? I would assume this should come from some common reference module, ideally shared with the Roslyn source generator. I noticed a discussion about <code>TestPlatforms</code> in the source generator code itself, I'm not sure to what extent these two can be reused either by compiling the same source file twice or by using some common dependent assembly but duplicating the enumeration in test code clearly sucks."
"@github issue is compiler analyzer's SupportedDiagnostics is wrong. since it reports diagnostics that it can never produce as supported diagnostics. SupportedDiagnostics should return only those that can be produced by compilation.GetDiagnostics() rather than including all errors ever defined in compiler (command line argument issues, binary output issues and etc)

..

by the way, the filtering sounds to me a bit of workaround. since regardless whether we special case compiler analyzer or not, its current behavior is not right.

This comment is wrong
"I am not suggesting to report a different error, just saying that the parser is probably the wrong place to report it.

I saw your other comment. This is probably wrong so I'll fix it.
"The code changed here, so this is no longer an issue.
Turns out we needed more fine-grained code here in order to catch the different ways a private-named property access can go wrong. This is one of the most interesting functions I've ever had the privilege of working on, really made me think!"
"I think this is wrong now. You definitely **do want to** cancel the body as well if we're tearing down the request.
It should be fine to skip the `shouldCancelBody` and `duplex` checks entirely. If an exception occurs, cancel everything."
"This prevents confusing errors as in https://dnceng.visualstudio.com/public/_build/results?buildId=526104&view=logs where bootstrap command failed but format.py continued and ended up using a wrong version of clang-format, which reported formatting errors."
"> Just a question here. In order to do that in S.Drawing.Common we switched to harvest for 3.0 or earliest. Should we do the same? Or do we want this new support in Unix to be available for 2.1?

The package today contains implementations for NS2.0(throws PNSE) and NCA2.0-Windows implementation. That means that we could potentially do that, but that would basically mean drop Unix support for this library for netcoreapp 2.0 and 2.1 which IMO is not what we want. The issue that we tried to fix by adding support on Unix was logged in 2017 and has 250+ upvotes meaning that most likely there are NCA2.0 and NCA2.1 apps out there that could benefit by adding this support today, and it seems wrong to me to drop 2.0 and 2.1 just because of a tiny implementation detail which is why for now we opted to cross compile."
"I think we should be fixing the error reporting we have instead of introducing a redundant one. The checks left in this PR are about validating that you got good cmake and C++ compiler. The best way to validate that you got a good cmake and C++ compiler is to compile something and run it.

My proposal is that we create a new subset that is built before the package restore step. This subset should compile a ""hello world"" using cmake, run it and fail the build if anything goes wrong. This design should have mimimal duplication and it will ensure that the tools actually work (e.g. that cmake is of the right version, etc.)"
Found the catch - this will do the wrong thing for a non-symlink file in a symlinked directory.
"Now I'm confused.  

Are there two problems here?

1. Do we agree that the test is definitely wrong? it shouldn't dispose of the `Metafile` instance in the scope of a `Graphics` that's using it?  If so then this is the PR that fixes that.
2. The next question is - if it's possible for libgdiplus to detect that it's being used incorrectly, should we assert or return some error code?  (I see that `Image.Dispose` is prepared to deal with error statuses, so
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/libraries/System.Drawing.Common/src/System/Drawing/Image.Unix.cs#L448 maybe the right thing is to return an error code from libgdiplus)

If there's a bug to be fixed in libgdiplus, I think that's a separate issue, no?

"> I thought that adding `undefined` wouldn't change anything since that used to be the semantics, but it sounds like I was wrong.

I believe the deal is that if you naively add `| undefined` to _every_ optional property, you wind up with no errors, minus the ones you couldn’t change because they were in node_modules etc. But the codefix doesn’t want to add `| undefined` to every optional property; it just does the ones that it identifies as needing to change. [Here’s](https://www.staging-typescript.org/play?exactOptionalPropertyTypes=true&ts=4.4.0-pr-45032-20#code/PTAEAEFMA8EMGMAuB5ADoglgewHawDYAKATlqpMYgJ4AqV5AzgFyiLECukAUDxjohQBmCSKACCARlABvLqFCwA-CwZs+Ac1AAfUDnYBbAEYUA3FwC+vfkJHiATDLkLloVcQ3bQhrFnyRYOGaWXHwCxMLwogBCoDACOAAmDOISADT2jvJKKmo46kE8CZDw+LDEon6IXixRZoYAdLCgALyg7ImQgnyQCWZAA) an example of a contrived program with one fixable error that turns into two unfixable ones upon being fixed.

```ts
// @github: true

interface A1 {
  a?: string | number;
}

interface A2 {
  a?: string | boolean;
}

interface B extends A1, A2 {
  a?: string;
}

declare let b: B;
b.a = undefined;
//^^ Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true'. Consider adding 'undefined' to the type of the target.
```

Fixing the property assignment adds an “incorrectly extends” error for each of `B`’s extended interfaces."
"I think this satisfies what @github asked for for _devices_

Todo:

- [x] Simulator needs component dylibs
- [x] Strip things. Nothing's stripped
- [x] Catalyst has a different directory structure for dumb Apple reasons, and greatly complicates things because symlinks aren't allowed in nupkgs. Might need to hide the .frameworks inside archives of some kind (suggestions gratefully received)

Catalyst has this layout:

"@github 
I kind of figured out how to use it, but there are a few questions.

Is it right that I run asmdiff through this?:
> py superpmi.py asmdiffs -jit_name clrjit_universal_arm64_x64.dll --altjit -target_os Linux -target_arch arm64 -arch x64 -filter coreclr_tests

The same question is, is there an opportunity to run not all tests, but some specific one that does not work? This would speed up the work of superpmi, especially it works for a long time when you set the --diff_jit_dump key to get a dump.

After the first and second run, I had a situation that regression occurs in different files, and sometimes it does not exist at all. I ran the command twice in a row and that's what brought out:

[First](https://gist.github.com/SeanWoo/7ee7c42825a61d6c9b34e5dba0eabac4)
[Second](https://gist.github.com/SeanWoo/2ec3d7649ef14f72ae233e2cabc8447e)

# Customer Impact

The VS4Mac team reported that native frames missing crashreport.json causing problems with their Watson analysis.

The wrong module was being passed to the remote unwinder because the load bias for shared modules
was being calculated incorrectly.

Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/63309

# Testing

Local testing. Ran diagnostics tests against this change. Will get VS4Mac team to verify after this PR's build is finished.

# Risk

Low. It undo's a change/regression from PR https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/61063.

Fixes #67423


# About 

There are multiple libraries that have `ArgumentOutOfRange_Index` error message in their resource files. Even if it states that 
> Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.

1. In some libraries it's used even in the situations where index being equal to the size of the collection is allowed. 
 
  - `System.Private.CoreLib`
  - `System.Collections`
  - `System.Collections.NonGeneric`
  - `System.Text.Encoding.CodePages`
  

- [x] Every such library was modified to throw [appropriate message on appropriate occasion](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/67423#issuecomment-1085691457).

2. In some libraries it's used solely in appropriate case of ""throw if index >= size"". So the message is ok here.

  -  `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`
  -  `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs`
  -  `System.Security.Cryptography`
  
- [ ] But maybe for the sake of future development of the library we should split it into  `ArgumentOutOfRange_IndexMustBeLT` and `ArgumentOutOfRange_IndexMustBeLE` too? Just to be consistent throughout the repo.

3. In some libraries it's included in resource files but never used.

  - `System.Console`
  - `System.Diagnostics.Process`
  
- [ ] Should we remove it from there, leave as is or split it like in previous question?

# Other

### `ThrowHelper`

- [x] Some of `ThrowHelper` methods too were splitted into two. That's 

* `ThrowArgumentOutOfRange_IndexException`
* `ThrowStartIndexArgumentOutOfRange_ArgumentOutOfRange_Index`

### Docs

On msdn probably lots of methods with wrong `Exceptions` sectors. Like [`List<T>.IndexOf`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1.indexof?view=net-6.0#system-collections-generic-list-1-indexof(-0-system-int32)) here:

This one actually **CAN** accept index that equals to it's length. 

- [ ] I want to fix it, but I thought it would be quite a piece of a commitment, so decided to ask first: may I?

I see this brings in System.Graphics. We are in the middle of a rename Microsoft.Maui.Graphics. It really should depend on that. Also the MauiShapeViews are  using Platform Specific drawing layers. This is wrong. They should use the graphics layer. That way it will draw with any graphics backend.

If stack-allocated to a `size` then the JIT has emit code that figures out the right size at runtime, which is overhead as it needs to round up to a power of two anyway.
Further note: small constant value (i think 16 is the limit) will be treated as ordinary locals by the JIT -- another optimization done.

> relying on stackalloc being zero-initialized

Good point!
Right now you can rely on the runtime to zero-init the stack-allocated content, as there's no `SkipLocalsInit`-attribute applied. But be aware of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/26586.

"making LanguageSettingPersister (or IOptionPersister) UI thread free is not small work.

and change everyone who using it to async

and then make LanguageSettingPersister to use JTF to lazily initialize it when they need it.

and caller (directly or indirectly through other service) on UI thread should change to use JTF.Run

…

any other way to fix it seems a hack such as creating yet another service just for LanguageSettingPersister so that it can queue actual work to other service which can have race (if someone ask option too fast, data is not there yet or if someone save data at wrong time, it doesn't get saved since VS passed shutdown time, or block shutdown time and etc which just make things more complicated)

anyway, I believe this PR is not trying to fix underlying option persister problem we have been having for several times now.

and fix it all together. and this part of code (UI, JTF) seems people having many different opinions.

so, we should bring this to design meeting and agree on how to fix option persister issue once for all.

"Hm, that's definitely not expected. A guess at what's happening- perhaps the cpp file you open finds the wrong `pch.h`, while the header finds the correct one. IntelliSense could then build a working PCH in response to opening the header, which could then be picked up by the cpp file when you return to it.

If so, one thing to double check is the order of the `AdditionalIncludeDirectories` list. Make sure `lib` is before the existing `..`. (Or even replace it, if that doesn't break anything else?) It might also help to temporarily disable PCH use project-wide and make sure the compiler can still find everything.

If that doesn't help, then maybe it's just some leftover state that would go away if you did ""Project > Rescan File,"" restarted VS, and/or deleted the .vs directory.

"> Should `sufficientFraction` instead be computed based on the number of cases...?

Maybe? Seems like 3 could be special case.

The likelihood needs to be high enough to offset the cost of the extra compare and branch if we guess wrong. So I think the likelihood should always be at least something like 0.3 and not go lower for larger switches. That covers switches with 4 or more cases.

We already specially transform switches with 1-2 cases in `fgOptimizeSwitchBranches`. We likely also handle case switches, though I don't see where we look for these.

That leaves 3 case switches. If we have a dominant non-default case over 0.3 and are also going to peel for the default then we're basically reducing the switch to a compare tree, but not getting the full benefit of doing so. I think this is ok for now.

-----

(Some other notes on switch peeling)

Ideally, once we peel, the residual switch would get simplified and perhaps some of this other logic would kick in and simplifies things further.  We could do this now if we peeled the highest numbered case, but not if we peel some other case.

Since we're always peeling the default (when lowering, so it would be peeled under any peel we do here), we should perhaps change strategy if the default case has a reasonable likelihood. For example, say there are 10 cases and the default case likelihood is 0.5, and case 0 has likelihood 0.25. We'd be better off first peeling for the default case. Once we do that, we can renormalize the switch likelihoods (multiplying by 1 / ( 1 - 0.5 )) and so case 0 relative likelihood is now 0.5, so we should peel for that case.

Of course once we do that second peel we can renormalize again and perhaps another case now becomes likely enough that we'd be willing to peel for that too. The rule of thumb I've seen here is that going up to 3 levels here can pay off (say the dominant cases are 0.9, then 0.09, then 0.009, these all become 0.9 with successive normalization). But I'm not sure we're ready for this just yet, as we also have to keep wonder how accurate our profile is when we start getting into the tail of the frequency distribution, and balance likely performance win vs code size increases. And there's some cost to having a high branch density.

"Hah, I'm actually XState maintainer 😅 In a way - I think that our types need a solid overhaul *anyway*.

While... we are flattered to be included in your perf test suite 😉 it's also a good sign that maybe we are overcomplicating things for the typechecker. 

Some recent changes to our types are in particular quite crazy (those designed to work with the typegen and have very unusual patterns used in them to ""stitch"" types together). My sincere hope is that this particular perf problem is not related to this part of the types as I took a loooot of time to get them working. Could you tell me against which version of XState are you running this benchmark? It would be useful for such information to be included somewhere in the result - as far as I can tell it's not in the comment of the bot nor in the attached benchmark file.

When it comes to the variance itself - I'm pretty sure our types ""get it wrong"" (from the user perspective). While I understand the concept of variance and can ""compute"" variance type in simple cases, I have no idea how I should think about it with such complicated types as ours, with a lot of layers, a lot of generics etc. Are there any resources/comments from the past that could help me understand this? Are there any tricks that could help TS to determine the variance type ""quicker""?

function Item({ kind, ...data }: ItemData) {
    if (kind === 'user') {
        <div>{data.id}</div>
    }
    if (kind === 'company') {
        <div>{data.name}</div>
    }
    return null;
}
```

But the following now works:

```tsx
type ItemData2 =
    | { kind: 'user', data: {name: string} }
    | { kind: 'company', data: {id: string} }

function Item2({ kind, data }: ItemData2) {
    if (kind === 'user') {
        <div>{data.name}</div>
    }
    if (kind === 'company') {
        <div>{data.id}</div>
    }
    return null;
}
```

Still worth highlighting that in the post :)

"On a desktop with tsserver logging enabled [1], I created a simple project, then opened a new Typescript file and pasted in some code [2].
I opened ajv.min.js, a single-line 121k file, and switched back to my test file. Goto-def was responsive after a second or so.
Then I opened Typescript's own run.js that we use to run tests, a 14 MB file, and switched back to my test file. Goto-def was responsive after 2-3 seconds.

- In both cases, as soon goto-def was responsive, the rest of the language service was responsive.
- Code notified me that it was not tokenising ajv.min.js, and there was no syntax highlighting.
- It took considerably longer to get quick info from run.js itself when I switched back to it. Probably another 10 seconds?

Based on this:

1. I think it's fine to proceed with the simple approach of requesting semantic diagnostics for plain JS files. If a particularly slow use case turns up in the beta period, we'll have a couple of ways to fix it.
2. I'll try to find out why grammar errors are in the checker and see how hard it would be to move them earlier. They make up about 20% of the errors in the checker, and most of the value for plain JS is probably in the grammar errors.

[1] So, faster because it's a desktop; slower because logging is on.
[2] Just some random code I worked on recently.

```ts
export class C {
    set x(...n) { }
}
declare var x: Promise<number>
await x
const y = await x

class Test {
    foo() {

    }

    bar() {
        this.blargh(this, ""completely wrong"") // Can't autocomplete second parameter

        const t = new Test()
        this.blargh(t, ""bar""); // Second parameter autocompletes to ""foo"", ""blargh"", ""bar""
    }

    blargh<T>(a: T, k: keyof T) {
        // some implementation
    }
}

const t = new Test()
t.blargh(t, ""bar"")
t.blargh(t, ""hi"")

The goal of this PR is change the current files to support the implementation of iCorDebug on mono:
- Split debugger-agent into debugger-protocol and debugger-agent, debugger-protocol will be used in the next PR in mscordbi implementation.
- Fix strings with the meaning of the commands, there were missing strings and then the PRINT_DEBUG_MSG was printing wrong information.
- On debugger-engine pass the offset of the IL when stop in a breakpoint.
- Created a new protocol major version to support the changes that we need to implement mscordbi.
- When mono debugger is started with server=n will waint until the timeout for a server to connect, this is necessary because depending on how we will launch the process with iCorDebug implementation, maybe mono will start before the debugger server(mscordbi).

Fixes partially issue #51564
(this issue is still under progress, more PRs are to come)

This PR makes the following calls compliant with Interop gudielines :

* Crypt32.CryptQueryObject
* Crypt32.CertGetCertificateContextProperty
* Crypt32.CertDuplicateCertificateContext
I know the PR should be small, but it's barely the minimum to move CryptQueryObject : this call uses many struct/enum/class and safe handles, that should either also be moved to Common folder.or deleted because they already exists there (so we need to reuse the later)

There's a change to CERT_INFO class inside Common folder, so it uses the created struct FILENAME (like CERT_INFO inside System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates\src\Internal\Cryptography\Pal.Windows\Native\Primitives.cs), using CERT_INFO with COM FILENAME causes overflows in tests since it uses int instead of uint.

I create this file Common/src/Interop/Windows/Crypt32/Interop.CertGetCertificateContextProperty_NO_NULLABLE.cs instead of reusing Common/src/Interop/Windows/Crypt32/Interop.CertGetCertificateContextProperty.cs because it's referenced by System.Windows.Extensions which does not support nullable yet

Sorry for the PR #60218 I was trying to solve a conflict by rebasing my branch on master and I did something wrong.

"macOS arm64 ABI is different in that multiple small arguments can be packed into the same stack slot. It means we have different behavior in some places in the JIT, and that different behavior was wrong here.
The behavior for the other ABIs did not have this bug."
"Hey folks this is getting really elaborate:

1. Is the string supposed to be UTF8 or UTF16 when it goes into the buffer?  all this talk of `wchar_t` is confusing.  We generally don't use `wchar_t` in Mono - we use `gunichar2` for utf16 and `ep_char8_t*` for UTF8
2. Is it important to use fancy string storage here? Anything wrong with just heap allocating a buffer?
3. If we need to use fast fancy storage, how about using a MonoMempool ?

"heyYui, can you file a bug on having us provide a better error message here.  Here we're giving an error about 'pop' being wrong (where pop is a method on Array), where it would probably be better to indicate that the type of the tuple array isn't assignable to number.

This is all about improving the error message and providing more directed, useful, information to the person who runs into this.

Thanks!

"> Couldn't you create SyntaxToken with invalid Text using SyntaxToken.Literal(..) and pass it to the method?

Could do that.  We'll need a way then to *not* trigger the telemetry/watson reporting in that case.  

i.e. we need to still get info about when this happens in the wild, while not bothering to report on teh cases we're using in tests just to validate that our invalidation logic works.

--

This is all seeming exceptionally overwrought IMO.  There is absolutely no precedence for this afaict in teh IDE.  We simply do not attempt to construct/test things we don't think are possible.  Nor do we try to assume things not stated through contracts.  Things we hope to be true we code for, and we bail if false, optionally reporting the unexpected cases to us.

That way, when we're wrong about an invariant, things legit crash (possibly caught by a boundary exception layer), and we can get info in a non-crashing way for things we're uncertain about.

"After some sleep, I'm wondering if this should be netcore-only since even if the existing behavior on legacy is wrong, code could rely on it anyway (especially since it reflects windows docs, even if they're wrong)."
"Thanks for following up on this PR, and my apologies again for giving the wrong guidance on how to handle the WRN_PrecedenceInversion.

Basically I'd suggest that if the warning blocks emit in a test, for example, that we can parenthesize in order to suppress it, but for most tests it is probably good to just paste in the new diagnostics."
"> how do you determine what actions should be run as separate AzDO tasks and which should be within single task? E.g. you can argue that signing should be separate if you want to see how signing time has changed over time.

I made the determination based off of various investigations I've had to do over the past few years which required me to essentially analyze trends or flakiness across builds. The most notable areas where this occurs is restore, SDK acquisition and test duration. 

As for signing I've definitely seen that be a problem in official builds where the signing service has caused us enormous grief. I haven't personally had to track it down myself on non-official builds where we aren't hitting the service. If you think it's a source of problem though I can pull that out too. 

> Seems like AzDO is really not very well designed in this aspect. Either you put more stuff into AzDO tasks, making your YAML more complicated and your build not runnable locally, or you put everything into one script that you can run locally but can't get AzDO telemetry out of - or can you? 

Indeed this is a major tension point for AzDO (and looking forward GitHub Actions). Their unit of execution is tasks and that is where they primary reporting comes from. While we'd prefer to bundle everything up into a simple script and just execute one thing. 

> Aren't there AzDO commands (printed to the script output) that would allow you to answer your telemetry questions? So instead of merging/splitting build actions couldn't we report AzDO telemetry from the build scripts?

Yes and no. 

Yes: you can use logging detail commands to create mini records. Those are structured and appear in the timeline which means scripting data collection is pretty straight forward as it appears in the timeline data stream. T

No: this is basically completely invisible from the AzDO UI, it only appears at an API level. This means in order for developers to understand what is going wrong with their builds they actually have to sift through the build logs and look at the errors. Experience has shown that on the whole developers are not great at this. Where as when a task named ""Restore"" fails it's pretty obvious what went wrong here. 

> Yes, it was the case if you wanted a specific flavor. At least basic run with some defaults worked. I think it would still be useful to have cibuild.cmd that has a single parameter that identifies the CI leg (using the display name, ideally).

One tension point I found within our own infra is understanding where the responsibility lies to change defaults based on whether or not we are running in CI. The responsibility seems to be duplicated between cibuild.cmd, build.ps1 and arguably our YML in a few places. Feels like there should be one place that says ""okay I'm in CI mode, let me set the defaults for CI"".

"@github squash merge of this PR is fine. I definitely want to *merge* the PR going into VS though as those commits are carefully curated. 

I'd rather merge my PR into VS right away and have your insertion follow-up and succeed on its own. Since your insertion will appear to 'downgrade' the nuget packages that you optimize, the bot that resolves conflicts will pick the wrong one and I have to manually fix it. But if my PR goes in first (or your insertion PR targets my PR's source branch instead of main) I believe the right thing will happen.
My PR by itself doesn't trigger any RPS regressions, so loss of IBC data from the Unsafe assembly evidently isn't too significant. And since that IBC data will be back with your next insertion, it doesn't seem like they _have_ to go in together."
"### User Tests

User Tests show expected breaks for js-only projects. These breaks don't exist when not in strict mode, and are addressable via `/** @github */` jsDoc type assertions.

### DT Tests
There are some breaks in DT tests that may need to be addressed:
  - [ ] `electron-spellchecker` - `Error in electron-spellchecker\nOK` - Unsure what is wrong here as there is no output.
  - [ ] `electron-prompt` - `Error in electon-prompt\nOK`
  - [ ] `electron-window-state` - `Error in electon-window-state\nOK`
  - [ ] `electron-localshortcut` - `Error in electon-localshortcut\nOK`
  - [x] `memcached` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`. These may be due to incorrect calls to `resolve` in the tests and if so are the kind of error this PR is intended to catch.
  - [x] `system-task` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `async-stream-emitter` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `graphql-relay` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `node-wit` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `react-window-infinite-loader` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `stream-demux` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `undertaker` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `xml` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `listr` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `mirrorx` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `nightmare` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `polka` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `react-router-guard` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `redux-form/v4` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `redux-form/v5` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `snapsvg` - `Argument of type (value: unknown) => void' is not assignable to a parameter of type '() => void'. Seems like the kind of error this PR is intended to produce.
  - [x] `react-virtualized` - `Type '(value: unknown) => void' is not assignable to type '() => void'`. Seems like the kind of error this PR is intended to produce.
  - [x] `fetch-mock` - Seems like the type specified to be assignable to `PromiseConstructor` is wrong and needs to be addressed in `fetch-mock`.
  - [x] `aframe` - `Property 'setHSL does not exist on type 'string | number | Color`. **Unrelated to this change**.

In general it seems the DT tests need to be updated, but that shouldn't be too difficult as correctly supplying an argument would be a backwards-compatible change.

### RWC Tests

Test failures in RWC seem to be expected and fall into the following categories:
- Untyped `Promise` usage in checked JS files in `--strict` mode.
- Untyped `Promise` usage in TS files when passing the `resolve` callback (whose type is `(value: unknown) => void`) to a function that expects `() => void`, which is the kind of error this PR is intended to produce.
- Expected changes to existing errors due to a change in the call signature for `resolve`.

### Summary

All errors in DT, User, and RWC tests are the expected outcome of this change. The DT tests mentioned above can be addressed by a backwards-compatible PR to DefinitelyTyped, which I can create prior to merging this PR.

Related PR: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/47216"
"If we're willing to give up the expressiveness of the runtime assertions in cases where we already report compile-time errors, then the two-helper emit can be even further reduced:

```js
var __classPrivateFieldSet = (this && this.__classPrivateFieldSet) || function (receiver, state, value, kind, f) {
    if (typeof state === ""function"" ? receiver !== state : !state.has(receiver)) throw new TypeError(""Private state access of wrong provenance"");
    if (kind === ""method"") throw new TypeError(""Attempted to set private method"");
    if (kind === ""accessor"") f.call(receiver, value);
    else if (typeof state === ""function"") f.value = value;
    else state.set(receiver, value);
    return value;
};
var __classPrivateFieldGet = (this && this.__classPrivateFieldGet) || function (receiver, state, kind, f) {
    if (typeof state === ""function"" ? receiver !== state : !state.has(receiver)) throw new TypeError(""Private state access of wrong provenance"");
    return kind === ""method"" ? f : kind === ""accessor"" ? f.call(receiver) : typeof state === ""function"" ? f.value : state.get(receiver);
};
```

The above still errors at runtime in the same places (since `f` would be `undefined`), even though the error would be more cryptic. We can even further reduce the size of the `__classPrivateFieldSet` if we don't mind emitting somewhat harder to read code:
```js
var __classPrivateFieldSet = (this && this.__classPrivateFieldSet) || function (receiver, state, value, kind, f) {
    if (typeof state === ""function"" ? receiver !== state : !state.has(receiver)) throw new TypeError(""Private state access of wrong provenance"");
    if (kind === ""method"") throw new TypeError(""Attempted to set private method"");
    return (kind === ""accessor"" ? f.call(receiver, value) : typeof state === ""function"" ? f.value = value : state.set(receiver, value)), value;
};
var __classPrivateFieldGet = (this && this.__classPrivateFieldGet) || function (receiver, state, kind, f) {
    if (typeof state === ""function"" ? receiver !== state : !state.has(receiver)) throw new TypeError(""Private state access of wrong provenance"");
    return kind === ""method"" ? f : kind === ""accessor"" ? f.call(receiver) : typeof state === ""function"" ? f.value : state.get(receiver);
};
```

Which is 9 lines of code as opposed to 14 separate helpers."
"Discussed in the call, but to put in writing—the reason `isNewIdentifierLocation` should be true in this case is because

```ts
({ | })
```

at this point you very well may be writing a new property declaration or even binding pattern, which is exactly what `isNewIdentifierLocation` is for—_any_ time you could be writing a name not already in scope, that property must be set to `true` on any completion responses. It sounds like that flag is wrong in TS files too."

Based on a customer feedback received in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/45592#issuecomment-741994471 I decided to try to shrink `CacheEntry` a little bit more. I was able to reduce the managed memory needed for allocating a `CacheEntry` from 280 to 224 bytes (on x64).

Main changes:

- remove two enum fields (`2x sizeof(int)`), store the information in an union struct called `CacheEntryState`. It now consists of two bytes for the mentioned enums and one byte for all the boolean flags. There is one more that is still not used, so we can add more stuff in the future ;). This looks like a magic and @github is responsible for teaching me this kind of crazy stuff ;)
- move 3 lists related to tokens to a separate type called `CacheEntryTokens`. This allows us for saving space if they are not used (the most common scenario)
- remove the `_lock` field, use the field that stores `CacheEntryTokens` for locking instead (it guards the access to the tokens and the lock is needed only to work with the tokens)

The CPU time has not changed, but allocations did:

@github Not quite... The imported canonical order for a dynamic block copy is `dst, size, src` (notice that it is wrong w. r. t. the original IL order). So we could have:
```
dst, size, src <-- unchanged
size, dst, src <-- gtEvalSizeFirst = true
src, dst, size <-- reversed ASG
src, size, dst <-- reversed ASG + gtEvalSizeFirst = true

(Inverse `DYN_BLK` density = number of method contexts / number of `DYN_BLK` nodes)
(Notably I measured this just before rationalization to not have noise from cases where we turn dynamic blocks into regular `BLK`s)

So it appears that indeed, we never set this value to `true`. Most likely because in the majority of cases the `size` is a simple local node - I would not expect complex expressions as inputs to what is essentially `memcpy` to appear often."
"Stream end is a http2 and http3 concept. I assume it has no impact on http11. Probably worth double checking with winhttp folks.

I would like a unit test of a http2 server returning more content than its content-length defines. We can check what socketshttphandler does, what winhttphandler does today (pre-pr) and what it does after adding this flag.

My experience is in the server side of http, but there we validate the content length and error if doesn’t match the actual content.

Correct me if I’m wrong @github :)"

"My concern is that this might be a step in the opposite direction we're trying to go. We want it to be dead-simple to work on this repo, and to have obvious error messages when contributors do the wrong thing or are missing required tooling. I don't think we're there yet -- the current errors are useless --, but I prefer the build fail fast instead of failing later with mysterious test errors."
Nit: wrong class
I'll see why it's being confused since it looks rather wrong if there are extraneous files.
"We don't think we want to do this.

This I believe could result in the creation of multiple certificates if there is a persistent issue that is causing an exception here.

We'd rather see the tool fail in these cases and get a chance to understand what's going on wrong."
can you explain what was wrong with the old code?
"As this solves it in the wrong place, closing."
"> This PR is retaining the existing behavior, so there's no risk of anything breaking. The previous code was extremely confusing because it looked like we were requiring asynchronous continuations, but because we were using the wrong enum type, it actually had no effect at all (the TaskContinuationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously value was being passed as the state parameter, being boxed as an object!).

Ahhhh, we passed in the wrong options. The existing behavior is still questionable 😄 "
"Before the fix one test would pass, and another would fail. It also easy to get into a regression where either both start failing or only one. I had such cases due to mistakes while fixing the bug.
I figured, it is better to keep separate tests so that it would be easy to diagnose what went wrong.

dumb question.  why not just have the TypeItem do the same thing the extension method item does?  then you can operate on both consistently.

The current limitations are largely an implementation detail and there is nothing wrong with the metadata since it is valid/parsable.

> However I do not understand the logic you encoded there with regards to the offsetHeight and I also think that we now always set the multi-line class, even when not needed. Can we discuss this algorithm there?

Sure, my thinking was the following:

1. If `allTabsWidth` exceeds `visibleTabsContainerWidth`, then apply the `multi-line` class to wrap tabs if multi-line tabs have been enabled in settings
2. However, the flaw in the above is that once the tabs were wrapped,  `allTabsWidth` would once again be equal to `visibleTabsContainerWidth`, so the class would be immediately removed. So, if `allTabsWidth` and `visibleTabsContainerWidth` are equal, it also checks if `allTabsHeight` is equal to `EDITOR_TITLE_HEIGHT` (the default height). If it is, then the `multi-line` class is removed.

You mentioned that the class is set even when not needed, is there a specific example of this? If my logic is wrong somewhere I can attempt to revise it.

> For example we can simply use the DEFAULT_EDITOR_MIN_DIMENSIONS.height as a driver and disable multi-line tabs if the editor height gets below this value?

Can do, if possible could you give me a pointer for where to get the current editor height from? I can try to look for it/create a method for it myself if it doesn't already exist."

"@github Sorry, I didn't add clarification for my question :).

In the current implementation, there are three steps to insert a new class declaration
1. copy comments., I think in this stage `copyLeadingComments` changes comment and adds `\r` 
2. delete node (with comments, for that reason need to copy comments before)
3. insert a new node

As I understood from the https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/23871 description, better to combine three steps into one to just replace a node with a function by class declaration. Maybe I'm wrong and need to do the following steps 

1. copy comment before (to change comment with a carriage return) and remove (to avoid comment duplication) previous original comment (I'm not sure, however, we can try to use `{ leadingTriviaOption: textChanges.LeadingTriviaOption.IncludeAll }` in `replaceNode`)
2. replace a node with function by a class declaration

Do `fourslash/server` tests require explicit changing comments to add carriage return symbols?

"What I mean is that in the following code

```

But it was already similarly the case for the old code:

```
(namedImport.importClause!.namedBindings as NamedImports).elements
```

where you'd end up running `undefined.namedBindings`.

So I guess I don't understand the need to switch to a `?.`.

The gist of this change is

* Add some validation to prevent custom parsers from corrupting Uri instances
* Remove a (very hard to hit) race condition where `Uri.Equals` could return the wrong result
* Reduce race conditions around `MoreInfo` accesses, that would result in throwing away a value instead of caching it (not dangerous, just potentially duplicated work)"

That case works on tests, with a signature completion showing up for `M` that has an associated action for importing `Foo`, but it doesn't work on vscode (the editor doesn't show it). I'm going to try and find out why.
Edit: it is showing up, it was just showing up as the very last item in the completion list (even after snippets). Once I picked it, it started showing up on the top again, right below the normal entry for `M`. My conclusion is that the vscode ordering of entries is a mystery 🤷‍♀️

That also made me realize that, if `Foo` is not exported, the signature we offer for `M` is going to reference type `Foo` anyways, and that's an error. I think that's ok though, since the user could either change `Foo` to be exported, or realize they can't write a signature for `M`, but I might be wrong.

"cc @github/jit-contrib 

Simple example where this kicks in:
```C#
    public static int F(int x)
    {
        int r = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++)
        {
            if (x != 0) continue;
            r++;
            if (x != 0) continue;
            r++;
        }
        
        return r;
    }
```
Here the jit was unable to prove the second `x != 0` was redundant. The flow in this case looks like

[edit: had the wrong graph here initially]

While trying to prove that the branch at D would make the branch at S1 redundant, the jit was considering the path S2 -> D -> S1, and so decided both S1 and S2 could reach S1, and hence the value of `x != 0` at S1 was not known.

The fix is to designate D as an excluded block, so that the jit only considers paths that do not pass through D.

A moderate number of diffs, largely improvements. The largest improvements are cases where blocks with some substantial computation (newarr) are now unreachable. 

The two largest regressions (see libraries pmi) are case where the RA creates large numbers of compensation blocks.

This is because we include the Unix/OpenSSL version of Interop.CryptoNative.cs which has the wrong library name.

I think we should rename the `CryptoNative` field to `AndroidCryptoNative` for all the DllImports to `AndroidCryptoNative_` functions to make these mistakes easier to catch."

I left a couple nits/comments about adding comments and possibly minor refactorings to help with readability when this inevitably is looked at again in the future.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/57702

The casing of the SDK imported via the Sdk attribute was wrong which lead to:

`Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms.csproj : error MSB4236: The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.SDK' specified could not be found.`

We should probably backport this into release/6.0-rc1.

"> What we are observing here is a limitation that exists in the product and should be fixed there. MSBuild/NuGet doesn't support checking compatibility between platforms yet. Example: $([MSBuild]::TargetPlatformCompatible('$(TargetFramework)', 'unix'))

Agreed. But until we get that functionality in the product, there's nothing wrong with us having some ""helper"" functions to make our code clean/readable."
"Since the advent of NRT, It's been like a green light to use *more* nulls. C# devs seem particularly averse to `Maybe` or `Option`.  Maybe (ahem), if these were added *to the language*, they'd get better adoption and then we wouldn't need so much extra syntax.

I also have another comment re. the actual exception type: in a library, like .NET itself, the exception is as meaningul as it can be. However, in client apps and libraries, where things are much more specific, then `ArgumentNullException` doesn't really convey anything meaninful. For instance, a better exception when processing `Customers` and encountering a null `Customer`, would be a `CustomerProcessingFailedException`.
Over the years, I've had devs quote guidance from 'Framework Design Guidelines' (which is a superb book, don't get me wrong), which makes little sense in non generic Frameworks."
"Yeah, the value it's set to be the ""DPI"" settings from the given platform (Usually from an API called ""DPI""). For example, when Android returns its native rects, it doesn't return the values with the given device DPI, so the math is wrong until it is added. "
Totally... Something went wrong here. I am sure at some point it was correct. Thanks for catching this!
"@github @github - this is wrong and I think will break the templates. Any idea how we can prevent the bot from ""fixing"" this?"
"We weren't doing that because there's no user code that runs inside this try/catch block 😆  

After the comment at L104, it was expected that everything would succeed unless something is seriously wrong.

It was intentional before your changes, and based on my other feedback, I'm not sure it needs to change."
What's wrong with using [Span's void* ctor?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1.-ctor?view=netcore-3.0#System_Span_1__ctor_System_Void__System_Int32_)
"In the API review meeting I believe Ryan claimed we were keeping the same order that the serializer accepted the arguments. Looks like the order was wrong, so we should probably change it 👍 "
"```suggestion
We may not investigate issues which haven't received many votes/comments and choose to close these. The reason is that the impact is very scoped and potentially something is wrong in the user code. Consider asking these questions on StackOverflow.
```"
"Thank you, I was working with the wrong assumption that config should be applied after the code and got confused by the other discussion. Updated"
"Frankly, this feels like the wrong approach.  That you're getting an error here means the returned `DateTime`s aren't `DateTimeKind.Utc`, which seems... not correct for their intended use.  There's no reason for them to be anything other than `Utc`, and the fact that the ""safe"" method doesn't otherwise correct the issue means it's going to cause problems further down the line.  If you echo/pass on the claims, is this currently causing these timestamps to change due to local/utc confusion?

The JWT claims are effectively ignorant of timezone, but are still absolute timestamps, and so can be considered UTC - a far better approach would be ensuring that the parsing method ensures that it returns the `DateTime` with the proper kind, and ensure that anything that could modify has the output coerced to UTC (via `SpecifyKind(DateTimeKind.Utc)` - which is just going to ""assign"" the kind, and leave the timestamp otherwise unchanged, and won't throw).
"
This seems wrong. Why would the page title depend on whether the project uses auth? Is the template with auth not correctly updated to include the `<PageTitle>` components?
I like the `in Endpoint.Metadata`. What's wrong with it? It could point the curious to API docs for endpoint routing.
"I split this into two commits to make reviewing it... possible. The first commit contains all the changes to our code-gened files. These were automatically generated and there is a whole mess of them. I recommend that you look at each commit separately, and on the first commit spot check a couple of the *.codgen.cs files and the *.txt files to make sure nothing crazy has happened, then turn your attention to the second commit, where the code I actually wrote is. "
"> Nice cleanup though I dunno if anything works with this today 😄

Right. The Socket transport ignores it since binding is synchronous and non-blocking. The `IConnectionListenerFactory` interface supports it though, so it felt wrong not to flow it."
"I did a bunch of perf runs locally to generally get a picture of what's going on.

With a custom logging provider which noop'd (to remove the impact of the actual logging), I saw around a 3% regression with logging the request, response, and response body.

"not sure what you mean. we want to give some initial value to it otherwise, concurrentdictionary goes crazy. you can see how we use concurrentdictionary in other places."
this whole approach feels very wrong.  We generated the tree manually.  Why did we not just put the rename annotation on the name when we generated things?
"@github I think the first item is wrong, the using statements should only be removed if the MSBuild property `ImplicitUsings` is enabled and we don't have that info in the template yet, so we're going to keep the usings there to ensure the template works in all projects. The others look right."
"Hi @github, I search through the references of the `Get<TFeature>` method in the codebase for half of an hour, but am not getting the ""aaahaaa"" moment so that we can use this extension method directly.

In most places if the feature is null we do one of the following - 
1. we are just avoiding certain initialization. literally a guarding `if` condition. 
2. Sometimes we add that feature in FeatureCollection. 
3. uses null coalescing `?.methodCall()` or `!.methodCall()` and forget. 
4. For some places we do throw an `InvalidOperationException` but the problem is the exception message is a different place to place, so if we use our new extension method, then everywhere the same exception message will be thrown and it will be a breaking change for users! I know it's just an exception message change, but still, (I may be wrong) it's breaking change I guess! 

Can you point out any place where you would have thought that we can use this extension method!?

"Yeah, I know, right? I can't wait. Until then, I think @github and I agreed that we can just use it correctly and let it barf gloriously in the compiler should you use the template wrong. Unless I misunderstood that conversation or he gets a new idea in the next week to scope it down."
"yaay, i'm not crazy :)"
"I think that exact point is where the last OSC 7 attempt got stuck as well: Is the `file://` URL we're receiving here per the FD spec, or per the Windows spec?

In the end, we can't support both, because as you've noted, they have different semantics for overlapping cases.

We could perhaps support the common subset by ignoring the FD spec's back-compat parse (`file://usr/local/bin` =>`/usr/local/bin`), and ignoring the Windows remote-host parse (`file://server/share/file` => `\\server\share\file`), and hence having unambiguous parsing for those URLs we don't reject as ""wrong host"" (FD) or ""remote host"" (Windows), although that does block using OSC 7 when my shell's CWD _is_ a remote (UNC) path, which includes WSL mounts accessed from the host.

Whichever format you choose, I can't see a way to avoid making some or all shells aware that they're on Windows, without already-rejected hacking at process information to determine details about the virtualised filesystem they are reporting paths against. The proposal is to punt that to a higher layer, but I don't think a higher layer can do anything differently on this point."
"@github Are Contributors allowed to refactor the test files? As I can see that most of the assertions failed because it is expecting an improper value

"Please rename then (maybe ToImmutableAndClear()).  FWIW, i find the semantics of MoveToImmutable very very very intuitive.  It's exactly as it says.  It takes the underlying array and creates the ImmutableArray out of it, doing it as a simple O(1) move instead of O(n) copy.  It's exception behavior is also intuitive and appropriate IMO.  The only safe way to do this is if the count/capacity are paired.  When not, youi've done something wrong and it throws.

So, please either make the semantics the same, or rename.  I'm fine with either. I'm not ok with teh exact same name having different semantics.  Tnx :)"

Now, when generating these 3 instructions, if they all don't fit in current IG (because of `SC_IG_BUFFER_SIZE` limit), we will end up creating new IG and have some `INS_align` instructions in new IG. After that, we will end up marking the `IGF_ALIGN_LOOP` on the newly created IG [here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/fa309cb74a406b97ceb49e26d8954c00818095c6/src/coreclr/src/jit/codegenlinear.cpp#L788) (which is wrong).

"what I meant was to fake a mark list overflow like you did with this code toward the beginning of sort_mark_list so you didn't need to have plan phase check for the mark_list_piece_size 

```cplusplus
    // if any other heap had a mark list overflow, we fake one too,
    // so we don't use an incomplete mark list by mistake
```
however that's also not correct 'cause some heaps are already using their mark_list_index so it'd be wrong to change it. but now I've thought about it a bit more I think we could make this better by allocating the memory for the new mark_list_piece*, if needed, before sort_mark_list. so for regions we'd have something like grow_mark_list_pieces before the `gc_join_null_dead_long_weak` join. and in the join we fake a global mark list overflow if any heap failed to alloc memory for their mark_list_piece*. this way we don't need to call sort_mark_list at all on any heap if we already don't have memory for the pieces (so we save the sort - of course you can achieve that part by simply moving the alloc code toward the top in sort_mark_list for that heap; but this way we save it for all heaps). what do you think? am I missing anything?

"> Don't you need similar change in markExportAsReferenced ?

Actually, I don't need to call `markExportAsReferenced` anymore. The `markAliasReferenced` is more correct for an export assignment (as it mimics what `checkIdentifier` would do). `markExportAsReferenced` looks at the wrong symbol for an export assignment (it looks at the `default` export symbol rather than the symbol of the identifier in the expression), so it hasn't been doing any meaningful work anyway. I'll remove its handling of them. (And you know what? The checking functions built into `markAliasSymbolAsReferenced` are strange - I'll try to move those so they're local to what they check, too)

> Also I think we should remove the isConstEnumOrConstEnumOnlyModule check or update it before calling markAliasSymbolAsReferenced in checkJsxOpeningLikeElementOrOpeningFragment,

I don't know why we check const-ness here, actually. I'm pretty sure we just need to always consider it referenced, const or no (since we need to preserve the import because we'll be referencing it for the factory function in the emit).

> checkPropertyAccessExpressionOrQualifiedName

I don't think so - the check there is just checking `prop` to see if it's even possible for `parentSymbol` to be const - a fast path. It calls into `markAliasReferenced` which does the full check.

> markEntityNameOrEntityExpressionAsReference

No need - this is only used for decorator metadata, which I think we'd rather have been the same for preserve const enums/non preserved (and const enums are just going to be mapped to `Number` and their namespaces `Object` anyway - unlike other types which may have necessitated keeping imports for classes of some sort; so we don't want their imports kept in preserve mode, since we won't use them!)."

We have no reason to do the return type special-casing below if the return _isn't_ context sensitive (it's extra work we shouldn't do since it'll be repeated in later inference phases), so we should still be checking that the return expression is context sensitive, even if we pile on additional constraints."

I'm pretty sure this will not be affected, since this PR is not doing `commonJS` => `ESM`, it's doing `TS namespaces` => `ESM`. There will likely still be a build step that bundles Typescript so that it works with Node as it did before.

> I hope I miss some obvious measurable upsides?

If following coding standards by making real modules (and not using `namespace`s) is not enough, using modules will unlock the possibility to do more optimized builds due to treeshaking that I don't think was possible with the old approach. For example #27891 regarding the growing size of the Typescript project.

There are likely more benefits than the above, but one should not dismiss the benefit of code that is easier to learn and maintain. Future contributors will likely have an easier time to learn the code base after this change than before.

"Thanks for starting the discussion about the design goals here! It's helpful to see a sketch implementation without getting too bogged down in tests.

I notice that quite a bit of the complexity here (and I'm not saying it's crazy complex) comes from tracking the disposals in groups so we can report their aggregate results. Let's consider whether we could drop some of that and make things simpler for ourselves, which might also make things easier to understand for customers.

Specifically, what if we treat each async disposal as a completely independent background task? If any of them fail individually then we report it (immediately, not waiting for the rest of its friends), but otherwise nothing else happens. Then we don't have to deal with any of the aggregate reporting.

I think this might be easier for customers to understand because if you have a lot of async disposal, some members of the group might take ages to complete, or might not even ever complete. Then if you're waiting for the whole group, you'd never see the failure statuses of the ones that did fail sooner.

It does make sense for prerendering (only) to be waiting for all its associated async disposals to complete before we issue the response, because we do want to fail the response if any of the async disposals fail.

"`I` was very wrong. `any` is at least the type of `p2`, which is bound to the same symbol as that property because the object literal at this location isn't being correctly interpreted as a binding pattern in all locations. This PR is like a partial fix for that (now the type isn't completely incorrect, at least), but the symbols still need to be bound up correctly. IMO, the root cause is object literal/binding pattern confusion causing us to not handle binding patterns correctly in all the places we need to. I'd like to do a more directed fix at making binding patterns actually appear in expression positions instead of object literals when they're actually binding patterns, and use that to fix this.

For now, this is much better, though."
"> if someone adds `-mcpu=generic` to CMake

What is the default flag used for osx? Since its basline is 8.1, it should be `-mcpu=armv8.1` by default, even if we don't specify it?

I don't understand how/why will someone want to use  `-mcpu=generic` and even if they use it, it will be `v8.1` only. Correct me if I am wrong.

> While an intrinsic would always be fine 

Can you check what code we generate today with default flags on osx for `__sync_val_compare_and_swap`? Should be `casal`. In that case, we can eliminate the `__sync_synchronize` for OSX. What change you tried that you mentioned in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/67824#issuecomment-1094337248?"

Due to this problem, I made a new analyzer project to try to test my code here inside Visual Studio, but something seem to go wrong (although the unit tests pass)

I made [this separate project](https://github.com/Youssef1313/ByValAnalyzer) in case it may be easier to debug this crash their (it'll be much faster to build it rather than building roslyn)."

Hmmm maybe it wasn't needed then, since the variable name was wrong but the POC runs fine without it anyways"
"Are these messages intended to be shown to a user? If so, they need to go in `diagnostics.json` so they can be localized. 

Also, I realize this came from @github’s proposal so if the editor folks have a strong opinion you can disregard—but the terminology `error` was a little misleading to me in this context, since it has nothing to do with compiler diagnostic errors and it doesn’t indicate that anything went _wrong_; it’s not like the refactor threw an error and had to abort."
"Hey @github - thank you so much for the feedback and suggestions! 😊

I made some changes starting from them and made a new PR that completely removes all `Unsafe.Add` usages from the entire `Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm` package, and with no effective performance loss at all from what I can see now 🚀

To reply to your previous points:

> Here are some ideas where you can save the cycles instead: [...]

Yup, basically ended up applying both those suggestions, I've documented everything in the new PR.

> What if there is a corner case bug in DictionarySlim where the property returns wrong size?

Just for sake of clarify, the `DictionarySlim` we use is not directly from the `Microsoft.Experimental.Collections` package, but it's a custom type that used the source of that as a base, which I've then customized and optimized specifically for our needs in the messenger types in the MVVM Toolkit. Of course, your point is still perfectly valid and a bug might very well slip into the codebase in that area at some point, so this PR should made the whole thing much more resilient and easier to debug 😄

As a final note, to get back to @github's original point, I was wondering if the expected adoption of the MVVM Toolkit would be enough to have this PR (I mean this one for .NET 5) meet the requirements for the .NET 5 release? Otherwise as Stephen said, I can just sprinkle a bunch of `!` operators where needed, so it wouldn't be a breaking change, sure."

This is misleading. `nethost.h` is used for `nethost.dll`, `nethost.lib`, and `libnethost.lib`, with different behavior based on `NETHOST_EXPORT` and `NETHOST_USE_AS_STATIC`.

The index that comes from icordbg is already the correct one read from pdb we don't need to ""fix"" it on runtime side.

When performing value numbering of the initial memory state for loop entries, we treat single-entry loops specially. First, we walk the loop to determine it contains non-analyzable (from VN's point of view, i. e. not stores to fields or arrays) memory-related side effects (""havoc""). While doing so, we collect the handles of fields and types of arrays, later to be used as primary selectors in VN, of modified fields. If the loop is determined to not have ""havoc"", we compute the initial memory VN (which would ordinarily consist of a `PHI` with one unknown input) as follows: take the outgoing VN of the non-loop predecessor, and reset all the maps corresponding to primary selectors that we know will be stored to in the loop from the previous walk to ""new, unique"" values.

This then allows us to find the values for locations that were not modified in the loop when walking the `MapStore` chains while numbering nodes in the loop.

This is all rather nice, but has one flaw: the VNs given to primary maps (corresponding to the values obtained via indexing into the heap with a primary selector) all have `TYP_REF` types, which is strictly not ""right"" for at least static fields, and for others, confuses the code that numbers stores to indirections.

Consider the following C# snippet:
```cs
private static void Problem(ClassWithFields a)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        a.Field++;

        if (a.Field == 1)
        {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

We had the following numbering for the interesting trees:
```scala
finish(BB02).

As can be seen, there is a cast inserted when `VNApplySelectorsAssign` performs the map updates for the store, it is coming from here:

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/972891ff4682968e6d693c4b618408a55befe0b1/src/coreclr/jit/valuenum.cpp#L8325-L8330

Here `newFldMapVN` will have `TYP_REF`, `indType` - `TYP_INT`, causing the mismatch, because the code just above uses `TypeOfVN(fldMapVN)`:

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/972891ff4682968e6d693c4b618408a55befe0b1/src/coreclr/jit/valuenum.cpp#L8301-L8303

The cast is inserted at an unfortunate point: above the primary selector map (in this case, the field map), breaking the `MapStore` chain and causing subsequent load to not find the value from the store. Giving proper types to the primary selector maps helps avoid that.

Now, a keen reader will notice that the code above is actually just wrong, as it will constantly insert casts in cases when the first fields is actually of a `struct` type, and where no casts are needed at all, as they, if required, would have been inserted in the `VNApplySelectorsAssign` call that ""gets rid of the remaining struct references"". So the question is: why am I not fixing this code, and instead fixing some other code that just happens to trigger this bug in another way?

The answer is that I think it is beneficial to the model to have it be typed consistently, which is both more understandable and more efficient (by avoiding allocating unnecessary VNs). Changes to VN are somewhat high in risk, so I will be making them very incrementally, and in small chunks. Ideally, most of them should be zero-diff ones. This one is not, so I am making it separately.

Question: with this change, more VM will be made, is that a concern? Answer: the method in question is rather cold (not discernible on a profile taken from replaying `libraries.pmi`), the new VM calls should be of the quick variety, and additionally, there are many, many more similar VM calls made inside `VNApplySelectors/Assign`, their cost will dwarf anything added here (I actually have an experiment that caches some of the info on the `FldSeq` nodes, it shows `0.1%` PIN improvements under SPMI, but it is probably not worth it in the VM scenario as it also increases the memory consumption by about the same margin).

Diffs: [`win-x64`](pending).

> What does ""registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_arm64]"" mean

On each platform we have a different way to ""Register"" a global install of .NET. On Windows it's in the registry, on Linux and macOS it's in a config file in the `/etc/dotnet` location. Since these registrations are potentially architecture specific it's a good piece of information to diagnose issues with finding runtimes (for example if the registration is wrong).

You can read more about this here: https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2020/install-locations.md

The only thing I do want to protect against is making sure we are actually running inprocess in the startup hook."

"@github right, you can build stuff as portable and still create a ""manifest"" to ensure that the distro specific package references the right dependencies to install. 
I have thought that the packaging tools somehow extract the list of dependencies from the compiled binaries automatically when creating the package, but I guess I was wrong. If the dependency list is always prepared manually by the package maintainer, then there is no difference between the portable and non-portable build. Except for the dynamic search for the libSSL.
@github could you please share what are the reasons for using non-portable builds for the packages you build? Maybe we are missing some important aspect here."

"Does this new task support the user overriding the values in the manifest? I think that is more the issue here. If the tool overwrites the file, then if it makes a mistake or the user wants something different they can't do that.

For example, if some designer comes and gives the dev a set of files to copy directly into the platform folder and the dev adds some more icons - effectively adding 2 icons into the app: 1 from the designer and 1 from MauiIcon. Is there a way for the dev to prefer the specific icon and overwrite all the values?

For the other platforms, if there is no icon set in the manifest, then the tool provides one. If there is an icon, then the tool does nothing. This allows for the tool to only do work if the dev has not explicitly told it not to. The dev should always have the last say - even if they are wrong. :)

It may just be the case that the new template manifest has nothing in it so the tool always generates the file. "

"Since there doesn't seem to be a good way to detect when a component was prerendered (AFAIK) and avoid invoking this JS method altogether, I've instead taken an approach in which `<title>` elements rendered from Blazor components are not removed after the initial render. I will concede this is a bit of a hack and only works because we know that `<title>` will be the first and only element rendered by `<PageTitle>` components. I also considered adding a special attribute to `<title>` elements rendered from Blazor components, but thought it might not be best to clutter things that way.

I'm open to other suggestions for approaches to this. If we were able to detect prerendering in `BuildRenderTree()` (or, rather, detect when we weren't prerendering), we could simply not render any `<title>` in `HeadSection` at first, then remove all `<title>` elements in `OnAfterRenderAsync()` without needing to check if they are rendered from Blazor components, then re-render with the new `<title>`. This would be a much better way of doing things IMO, but there just doesn't seem to be a good way to check if we're prerendering on the first render pass. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong about that. 😃 "

This seems a bit quirky. Maybe it is the right design, but I'd be interested to discuss it. What I'm concerned about is that commonly, developers *think* they know what the item size is, but they are wrong by a small margin of error, perhaps because of the element `margin` being added onto its `height`. My hope had been that we can calculate the actual height and thereby free developers from the consequences of being slightly wrong, whereas the rule in this PR means we couldn't help them in this way.

I understand it's hard to determine the exact height but I'm unsure how bad are the consequences of us getting it wrong by a < 1px fraction or if there are any other approaches you've considered. Let's discuss when possible!"

Should `RuntimeSignatureComparer` also be adjusted?

Also, I notice that this PR hasn't updated `MakePropertyAccessorOverriddenOrHiddenMembers`. That means it is using a relaxed comparison, which is not constrained by new covariance rules.

"Thanks @github!

This works and I can communicate with the server with a wrong host certificate. However, it is not ideal since I need to use a platform-specific API (Android) in order to extend HostnameVerifier and establish communication.

Ideally, since my app targets multi-platforms, a universal solution for my http client library targeting a single framework would be the best (my http client communication library is universal and consumed by all of my platforms), which was how it worked before in the Android platform (when using mono android 8.1 framework) by simply extending the ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback.

This is, although a bit cumbersome (since my client library needs to target android specifically for this workaround), an acceptable workaround for my case, however.

Thank again!"
"I'm not sure what this is doing.

1. Is it adding the runtime config template from the functional test to every testsuite?  That seems wrong.
2. Why is it using the `.template.json` file from the source directory?  it should be using the generated `runtimeconfig.json` from the output directory (ie from ""bin/Debug/.../runtimeconfig.json"") or maybe from the publish directory (I'm not sure) - there is probably some property that is set to the path to that file.  I'm not sure.
3. It probably doesn't need to be part of the `BundleTestAndroidApp` target.  It can be its own target that the `PublishTestAsSelfContained` task can depend on.

"Either this comment is wrong, or your removal of the `Where` is wrong, but I have no idea which"
"I believe the original comment is wrong, but also confusing.

In particular, we expose `Vector128<float> Fma.MultiplyAdd(Vector128<float> a, Vector128<float> b, Vector128<float> c)`, this is logically `r = (a * b) + c`.

All three instructions are of the form `VFMADD***PS xmm1, xmm2, xmm3/m128` differing on which argument is treated as `a`, `b`, or `c`.

As such:
* `132`: `xmm1 = (xmm1 * xmm3/m128) + xmm2`
* `213`: `xmm1 = (xmm1 * xmm2) + xmm3/m128`
* `231`: `xmm1 = (xmm2 * xmm3/m128) + xmm1`

This path was originally `op1->isContained` meaning, `op1` is the ""memory"" operand and should (to avoid an additional `movaps reg, [addr]`) take the position of `xmm3/m128`.

Since `op1` is part of the multiplication and should take the spot of `xmm3/m128`, we can therefore pick `132` or `231` as the correct form. Which we pick should depend on if the storage location was `op2` or `op3`"

"I played around with it a bit more. Breaking out the `AssignmentDeclarationKind.Prototype` case and adding the `ObjectLiteralExpression` properties to that node seems to do the trick. Don't need the `prototypeAccess` either since we should be in one...

```ts
case AssignmentDeclarationKind.Prototype: {
    const binaryExpression = (node as BinaryExpression);
    const assignmentTarget = binaryExpression.left as PropertyAccessExpression;

    // If we see a prototype assignment, start tracking the target as a class
    if (isIdentifier(assignmentTarget.expression)) {
        addTrackedEs5Class(assignmentTarget.expression.text);

            assignmentTarget.expression as Identifier);
    }

            forEachChild(binaryExpression.right, addChildrenRecursively);
        endNode();
    }
    return;

I had to set `[AssignmentDeclarationKind.Prototype]: true` in `isEs5ClassMember`. I haven't tested it thoroughly enough to see if that breaks anything else.

"Let's make sure we're on the same page:

**Are you saying `spellingSuggestionGlobal1.ts` (as written, with `const x`) should produce the error message `Cannot find name 'global'. Did you mean 'globalThis'?`?**

If so, I disagree. Users will follow that suggestion and change `global.x` to `globalThis.x`, then get another error (`Property 'x' does not exist on type 'typeof globalThis'.`), then be confused/frustrated and have to research why it doesn't work, then probably end up ignoring the suggestion anyway and write `x` instead of `globalThis.x`.

**Or are you saying that in situations where `x` is a known property of `globalThis` and the user writes `global.x` that it would be nice to say `Cannot find name 'global'. Did you mean 'globalThis'?`?**

If so, I agree, but unfortunately that would be tricky to implement (unless I'm missing something). I'd bet that this situation occurs rarely in the wild, so it might not be worth the complexity cost to maintain a dedicated suggestion for it. I could be wrong, though.

In any case it seems orthogonal to the bugfix in this pull request. Currently [if you write something like `global.Math` the error message won't suggest `globalThis`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/OYGw9gRghiB0CyUAuALIA), either.

"> Suppressions are a hack for hacking your way out of issues a cast won't fix (like weird inheritance issues). But a cast will fix almost any issue (even those issues if you're creative with where you cast and to what) - every example you have here can be fixed with a single `any` cast (on the receiver, library itself, or argument), which is much better handled in the language. In other cases, where you have a massive chunk of unchecked code, the per-file directive is fine. If a third party lib has the wrong type, you cast to the correct type or `any`, up to you, a suppression is completely incorrect and the wrong solution to the problem.
> 
> Honestly, we thought suppressions were a bad idea to begin with and I had to argue they had uses when migrating JS projects to TS (essentially as automatable TODOs since per issue suppressions are easy to place automatically). But some people turn to them rather than the much simpler cast, and seeing the arguments here just reinforces that - suppressions aren't ""better"" than a cast - they're much much worse, and they leave the compiler in a silent error state where things may not behave as expected. They are an absolute last resort, and _honestly_ the presence of a suppression should itself be an error, to indicate that the project has unchecked code that may have unintended cascading effects on downstream code (like quietly leaking an `any` that isn't caught by `noImplicitAny`).
> 
> If anyone is left thinking a suppression like this is their only possible solution, then we've failed in our documentation somewhere - even in JS we support jsdoc casts now, so you can cast out of almost any issues in JS, too. (Even missing imports can be fixed with `declare module` declarations)

Then why do we have `@github`? The same case goes, there's already a few use cases over in the issue linked in the OP. I understand the point that we want everything to be strict and casted correctly, however if we have options such as ts-ignore already, aren't we are already doing that suppression option anyway? what harm does this really have at the end of the day? If people are adding `@github` already, surely we want to enhance the developers experience?

I do agree suppressions are bad and we shouldn't supress before casts. However.. there's a use case for developers during debugging, migration etc."

Backport of #46151 to release/5.0

Fixes: #45651

## Customer Impact

On Unix, when using blocking overloads of `Socket.ReceiveFrom` after an asynchronous call to the same socket, the call may return wrong `remoteEP`.

## Regression?

Yes. The behavior is correct on 3.1.

## Testing

Extended `SocketTestHelper` so existing tests can validate the sync-over-async path of the blocking `ReceiveFrom`. Unfortunately, those tests are disabled on the 5.0 branch, so I had to port a minimal subset of #44591 (fix enabling the tests) so we can run them on CI for 5.0.

## Risk

Low. The bug was a small overlook, the fix is trivial, that impacts only the affected sync-over-async `ReceiveFrom` path.

"@github on further inspection, this seems like a one-off but was these DNS failures to talk to AzDO were the first two things this VM did after startup.  Given it successfully had to talk to and resolve DNS for Azure Storage, Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hub, and Microsoft Container registry in this time, and that we've had stuff in place to make sure the Helix daemon doesn't start before the network services I think it can be chalked up to a temporary network problem on this VM.

(not sure it's correct, running locally, the CI job might picked up a wrong baseline)

From a local run I see a lot of size regressions due to inlining (along with improvements). Now, when the inliner sees a GT_CNS_STR it considers it as a constant argument so all operations on this argument in callees are considered foldable including branches leading to bigger ""benefit multipliers"". Example: https://www.diffchecker.com/mLb1tijN (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/57bfe474518ab5b7cfe6bf7424a79ce3af9d6657/src/libraries/System.Private.Xml/src/System/Xml/Serialization/SoapAttributeOverrides.cs#L41)

Unfortunately, there is a faulty (too optimistic) heuristic ""if I see an unknown call and we have a const argument on stack - the call most likely returns another const"" - I am going to remove it, it's responsible for huge diffs in general.

I bet there will be some crazy corner case/thing and it won't work ... but I definitely hope it's not the case.
"> Seems like we use the ""enumerate early args then late args"" pattern quite often, I wonder if some sort of combined iterator makes sense.

I think for the most part these cases are ""visit all operands of `GenTreeCall` nodes"" and we should probably look into making them use either `GenTree::UseEdges`, `GenTree::Operands` or `GenTreeVisitor`. Also if the ordering is not important we can just use `Args()` and access both `GetEarlyNode()` and `GetLateNode()` in the loop body. However, I think this is a cleanup for another PR.

> Also wonder if we can come up with some kind of safeguards to make it harder to look at the wrong enumerations. Or maybe find better descriptive names?

I agree, it would be nice to find a better name for `LateArgs` that makes it clear that this is a subset of `Args` and that it may not be in arg order. `ArgsNeedingLatePlacement` could be one, although a bit verbose...
I do think with this PR the situation is significantly better than before. Iterating `Args()` and using `GetNode()` is in almost all scenarios the thing you want (it will never give you a placeholder/setup node). Contrast that with before, where iterating `gtCallArgs` and using `GetNode()` would give you setup nodes/placeholder after morph.

Note that many places in this PR are using `GetEarlyNode()` before morph which is always the same node as `GetNode()`. New code should probably just use `GetNode()` here, but when I mass-converted the uses I attempted to make sure the semantics were the same as previously. Perhaps something I might look at simplifying in a future PR."

We use this `additionalDeclarations.Add` mechanism in the source generator when we can't declare the local exactly where it's needed due to branching structure and the compiler not always being able to see that the local is definitely assigned.  In such cases, we instead emit the local at the beginning of the method, default initialized, and then later assign it where we need to.  In this particular case, we should be default assigning it but are accidentally calling base.Crawlpos().  This isn't functionally wrong, but it's unnecessary.

Introduced changes are fixing the problem of wrong stack size calculation for control flows with back edges.

This has been achieved by modifying the code generation loop in `generate_code` function to:

- Skip blocks which have uninitialised stack sizes 
- Mark emitted blocks
- When the loop finishes if the code generation is not complete (there were some skipped blocks), the code generation loop is repeated
- Following passes only handle blocks skipped in previous ones (already emitted blocks are not taken into account)

This change may impact performance.

Fixes #68757.

"~HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions should be as fully populated from config ass possible before calling ApplyHttpsDefaults which calls into user code with the options object.~


~I'd remove the two if blocks that were added to this method and add the following right before ApplyHttpsDefaults.~

Then, right here, after ApplyHttpsDefault, I would add the following:

"I rolled through this a few times. `fallbackSourceFileEncoding` is something that's informed by a compilation.

"My concern is this scenario:

1. Project A depends on a Metadata.dll that _doesn't_ have any IVT attributes in it.
2. Project B also depends on a different Metadata.dll, but it does use internals via IVT from it's Metadata.dll.
3. Some search happens on a public type in Metadata.dll, and the analysis is done with the IAssemblySymbol that is seen through A; the cache is populated that Metadata.dll is consumed from A and B, but because we're using the IAssemblySymbol of the Metadata.dll as seen through A, neither are marked with ""has internal access"".
4. A search happens in B's code on an internal type obtained from Metadata.dll through the IVT B sees. Because it's internal, we fetch the entry from step 3, and filter it to only things with internal access, which is nothing. B's code is never searched, so the identifier you invoked find reference on might not be found!

I see a few approaches for this:

1. Delete the cache. Problem solved; I think you said privately you are already doing that, so maybe that's the easiest answer.
2. [If we have to restore the cache...] Don't care. I'm hesitant to say this only because I don't know how widespread this is, I do know how difficult it will be to figure out a customer report if it does happen. I'm also wondering if Roslyn could hit this itself: our CodeStyle layer builds against NuGet packages that are older: would we end up building the IVT list based upon the IVTs in the NuGet package we build against, a newer IVT added in the source might potentially get skipped...? Consider my scenario above, where Project A is our Code Style layer and B is some code that has IVT into our Workspaces layer. Minimally, if we choose to not care, a comment at least recognizing the cache issue might be wise so that way if somebody else is debugging and thinks the cache is wrong, they know they're not crazy.
3. [If we can't delete the cache and find we must care...] Fix it. We already have to walk through all projects and all IAssemblySymbols to actually see which projects are referencing the assembly name in question; at that point we've collected all the IAssemblySymbols that might have an IVT we need to consider -- if we union all of the IVTs together of all the those assembly symbols, then the cache is safe. Assuming you don't process the same IAssemblySymbol more than once, this shouldn't really be any slower than what we have now. I'm guessing multitargeting might mean each IAssemblySymbol might be different, but it's easy to ask if two come from the same PE file path on disk, which would be sufficient for our needs here."
"I .. honestly don't know why I didn't choose that. It seems wrong for WindowsTerminal.exe to be depending on an interface from all the way down in TerminalControl; it's an app concern, and Control just happens to share the same concern."
"There likely should be an output from the task that includes the written generated files into FileWrites, so later builds delete the previously outputted files and a MSBuild clean would actually delete them. Is there a plan to include that? My impression is the file tracker mechanism you did write tests isn't used for that, but I could be wrong."
The check above which checked for category being exactly TypeFlags.ValueType was wrong which caused single element structs wrapping an enum to behave incorrectly.

> No, but the spec recommends to wait for a client to cancel since a server can not decide whether the result is useful for the client or not.

Just as it is important for clients to be robust to naive servers (and LSP accommodates this), servers need to deal with imperfect clients.

The ability to reject requests with ContentModified is important to prevent an ever-growing backlog of file versions that need to be parsed. In particular we have seen clients in the wild that can send implicit requests after each keystroke and never cancel them. This causes a backlog when reparses are slower than the edit frequency.

Of course it's sufficient for either the client or the server to be smart, but absent some capability advertised by the client, servers must assume clients are dumb (and vice versa)."

"Even with the fix, the `_glyphIndices` for simple runs will have *wrong start* index, if there's N-M runs previous to them. For example a simple line like this:

```text

```

There's two runs. First is complex, the second is simple. 

| Text | Length | Glyph Count |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 😀| 2 | 1 |
| (A lot of spaces | 118 | 118 |

The correct `_glyphIndices` is this:

| Index | Value |
| -- | -- |
| 0  | 11685 |
| 1  | 3 |

| 0  | 11685 |
| 1  | **0** |

Notice there's an incorrect 0 indice here, because when we do `GetTextComplexity` on the second run, we have no idea how many glyphs the previous run takes up, and assume the number is equal to the textLength (2) and fill up the `_glyphIndices` from there."
">enumeratorMethod.Parameters.Any(p => p.IsParams) [](start = 74, length = 48)

This calculation feels fragile and possibly incorrect in a general case. Presence of ```params``` modifier doesn't actually imply that the argument always has an expanded form. For example, the parameter might not have the right type. Or ```params```, which is just an attribute in metadata, can be on a ""wrong"" parameter. Etc. See, ```OverloadResolution.IsValidParams``` for example. Rather than trying to re-infer this information, I think we should find a way to thread it through from the binding. Also, with recent work to move creation of default values to binding, I would expect that would also take care of param arrays, when necessary.

"What is the purpose of an error message? It's not (necessarily) _just_ to say ""something went wrong."" If that were the sole purpose, we could print out the `Reason` message and be done with it.

The purpose of the error message is _also_ to inform the user of _what_ the problem is in such a way that _they can fix it_.

Your updated message doesn't satisfy that purpose. We just know that unzipping _some file_ failed for _some reason_. We don't know what to do to fix it. Should we clean and rebuild the project? Sacrifice a chicken? Burn the world? Who knows! The error message certainly doesn't say....

As such, the previous message is much better.

"I did some quick and dirty profiling on my current change. One note: I have a pretty degenerate case: Four installations of VS, which adds seven! profiles when both generators are enabled.
1. It looks like CShellLink::SetPath is crazy expensive! Makes me think the longer the jump list gets, the worse startup perf is going to be. Maybe worth a user setting to disable creating jump list entries, separate from creating dynamic or proto-extension profiles.
2. The two generators I added are proportionally about the same amount of CPU time as any one of the other generators.
3. There is a definite opportunity to increase the VS generators performance by caching the instances of ISetupInstance instead of getting them twice. I'll work on that for my next commit.

Second not all assemblies have  `UnsupportedOSPlatform(""browser"")`, i added here because this is where assembly level  `UnsupportedOSPlatform(""browser"")` attribute added.

What if the server said it was speaking gzip but didn't send the gzip header, only the compressed body and gzip footer? Etc.

ok, i'm agree with this, but then we could simply return an meaningfull error instead of the wrong error message ""The archive entry was compressed using an unsupported compression method."" and returning something like ""The request is announced to be compressed but isn't a valid gzip stream"" and give the caller an ability to access the underlying stream.

"> Both examples are weakly typed (return object). What is the example for the strongly typed consumer of this?

Possible scenario (though it would require API tweaks):

```cs
// calculate and cache these upfront
Type actualServiceType = environment.GetConcreteTypeForAbstraction(typeof(IMyService));
ObjectFactory<IMyService> factory = ObjectFactory.Create<IMyService>(actualServiceType);

// call this in a hot path, such as per-request
IMyService service = factory.CreateInstance();
```

Or, for an MVC-like framework's per-request processing logic:

```cs
Type controllerType = GetControllerTypeForCurrentRequest();
ObjectFactory<Controller> factory = s_factories[controllerType];
Controller controller = factory.CreateInstance();
Console.WriteLine(controller.GetType()); // could be AdminController, WeatherController, etc.
```

There's nothing stopping us from saying ""`ObjectFactory.CreateInstance` always returns object, not T."" But IMO there is something nice about an API that returns _T_ instead of _object_, meaning you don't have to cast the return value and you don't have to worry about putting the wrong category of factory (`ObjectFactory<IServiceA>` vs. `ObjectFactory<IServiceB>`) into your static cache, etc."

### Baseline proposal

(This is the PR as I reviewed it, where _Int32ToHexChars_ has undergone a straightforward conversion from pointer-based to span-based.)

```cs
        private static int Int32ToHexChars(Span<char> buffer, uint value, int hexBase, int digits)
        {
            int bufferEndIndex = buffer.Length;
            while ((--digits >= 0 || value != 0) && /* Only to elide bounds check */ (uint)(--bufferEndIndex) < (uint)buffer.Length)
            {
                byte digit = (byte)(value & 0xF);
                buffer[bufferEndIndex] = (char)(digit + (digit < 10 ? (byte)'0' : hexBase));
                value >>= 4;
            }
            return bufferEndIndex;
        }
```

    L004d: pop rdi
    L004e: ret
```

### Modification B - simplify hex conversion

This modification involves replacing the two jump instructions within the hot loop with a single conditional jump instruction. The conditional jump is only taken if the digit is 'A' - 'F'. If you do this, you'll need to modify [`GetHexBase`](https://source.dot.net/System.Private.CoreLib/R/9e867b5206ddc67d.html) to append a `- '0'` to the end. That modification allows you to perform the `+ hexBase - '0'` operation as a single step.

```cs
        private static int Int32ToHexChars_B(Span<char> buffer, uint value, int hexBase, int digits)
        {
            int bufferEndIndex = buffer.Length;
            while ((--digits >= 0 || value != 0) && /* Only to elide bounds check */ (uint)(--bufferEndIndex) < (uint)buffer.Length)
            {
                uint digit = value & 0xF;
                int c = (int)digit + '0';
                if (digit >= 10) { c += hexBase; }
                buffer[bufferEndIndex] = (char)c;
                value >>= 4;
            }
            return bufferEndIndex;
        }
```

    L003f: mov eax, r10d
    L0042: pop rsi
    L0043: ret
```

### Modification C - hoist _digits_ and _value_ checks outside the loop

This eagerly calculates how many characters will _actually_ be written as part of the loop, and it resizes the buffer to be the appropriate length before entry to the loop. It's a little more work upfront, but it means the loop itself is very tight since the only condition you're checking is whether you've run off the end of the buffer. In particular, _value_ and _digits_ no longer contribute to the loop evaluation condition dependency chain.

(Edit: On review, I'm passing the wrong parameters to _Slice_, but that's outside the hot loop so it shouldn't affect any theoretical perf numbers.)

```cs
        private static int Int32ToHexChars_C(Span<char> buffer, uint value, int hexBase, int digits)
        {
            int actualHexDigitCount = CountHexDigits(value);
            if (actualHexDigitCount > digits)
            {
                digits = actualHexDigitCount;
            }
            if ((uint)digits < (uint)buffer.Length)
            {
                buffer = buffer.Slice(0, digits);
            }
            
            int i = buffer.Length;
            while((uint)(--i) < (uint)buffer.Length)
            {
                uint digit = value & 0xF;
                value >>= 4;
                int c = (int)digit + '0';
                if (digit >= 10) { c += hexBase; }
                buffer[i] = (char)c;
            }
            
            return buffer.Length;
        }

"> This looks weird. Why would a test project have a reference to its test runner? We don't have that for non mobile OSs.

For non mobile OSs the test runner is XUnit and we get it via a NuGet package. 

In this case the Main application test runner are these test runners which need to wrap xunit in order to make it a runnable mobile app. We need the runners to be in the publish directory and be part of the bundle. Before this change we where hard coding/calculating the path for the runner and copying it manually to the publish dir. Making various things difficult, these were built during Mono builds, which mean that if you follow the split build model like in CI you need to carry them over as artifacts and make sure they land on the right location when building the libraries tests and flow the right runtime configuration, etc. Also in order to reduce size in the bundles we want to run the linker to trim the app, which relies on the SDK list of files that are part of the closure, since we were copying manually these where not consider causing the trim result to be wrong. Another thing, incremental inner dev loop changing these projects was not easy as  you needed to go build them on mono and actually use the same configuration you used for the mono runtime for these to be found, etc.

This is something that all test projects use in mobile so the most natural thing to solve those problems was adding a P2P."
"I understand the concern that you have, but I disagree on some points.

> It should not push down C because the user would then select B instead of C.

You are of course theoretically correct. My arguments here are practical:
1. It doesn't happen that often in practice
2. Clicking on the wrong thing doesn't cost the user anything (UI doesn't change in a dramatic way, can just click again on the intended result)
3. We could throttle updates to predictable intervals (e.g every 1s) so the user can intuitively know when an update might happen.
4. The user can just wait for all results to return (which is what they are forced to do now) before interacting. They are strictly better off with streaming.
5. As long as the user's current selection/view is maintained, I think it is ok for the results around it to be updating.

> It will push down the C-subtree, making the user click the wrong item.

Only if subtree A is expanded. I forget what the behavior is in the PR as it stands now, but we wouldn't need to auto expand any subtree automatically until all results are in. I think the auto expand behavior depends on # results in a subtree so it wouldn't make sense to auto expand anyway until all results are in.

> instead of resetting and resorting all locations we should always have append-insert semantics.

I got the opposite feedback on https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/28751, because the sorting was relevant there. As of right now, I would agree that the sorting isn't as relevant for references here (still a non-zero amount of relevant), but we would be precluding it from being more relevant in the future.

It also seems a little bit inconsistent if we have different behaviors for streaming in different contexts.

"Based on the review comments it seems I haven't done a good job of explaining what I'm trying to accomplish here. 

A compilation event is a muli-process problem for C# / VB. The MSBuild process (of which there are multiple) begins the compilation event by constructing a message that it sends to the VBCSCompiler process (of which there is one). The compiler receives the request, kicks off a `Thread` and then processes the compilation from there. Upon completion it constructs a response and sends it back to MSBuild. 

The log file contains messages from all these different MSBuild processes and all of the threads within VBCSCompiler interleaved. The only identifying marker for message in the log is the process and thread ID. That means reading a log file requires you to figure out which PID maps to which process (MSBuild or VBCSCompiler) and which TID within specific PID (the VBCSCompiler) maps to a given compilation event. That doesn't help a lot thouh though with the core problem which is typically trying to find the compilation that failed then look at all of the log entries for that compilation. Basically filter the log down to all of the events for a compilation and see where it went wrong. 

This PR attempts to address that by doing the following:

- Replace the PID in the log file with a concrete name: either `MSBuild <PID>`, `csc / vbc <PID>` or `VBCSCompiler`. Now at a glance can tell which process wrote the line
- Use a request id (simple `Guid.NewGuid()`) to track a compilation event across the processes. It is created by MSBuild, attached to the protocol and then every process puts that `Guid` into messages when they're writing a log event specific to a request. That makes it incredibly easy to filter out the log file to the events for a given process 

Below is a sample of how the log file looks after this change. Notice that `c8d7ad91-490f-420c-9a96-f3881a8804ca` is the request for a given compilation. I can easily just search for that in the log file, read through the messages now and easily see ever hop along the way to understand how this event was processed.

"I just tested whether this works when trying to navigate to an inner class.
I discovered the following issues:
* For `A.B.ClassA.InnerClass` `GetFullReflectionName` returns `A.B.InnerClass`, which is completely wrong.

* `CSharpDecompiler.DecompileType` fails when it's passed the name of an inner class. I would say this is by design, but we could improve it by using the top-level type name stored in `FullTypeName`.

a) Fix `GetFullReflectionName` to actually return the proper full name using reflection syntax and fix `CSharpDecompiler.DecompileType` to handle nested classes properly.

to unwrap the inner class before passing it to `GetFullReflectionName`.

I think I will fix the handling in `CSharpDecompiler.DecompileType` in any case."
"> Given the current setup when I hit <kbd>F5</kbd> will the debug fail to launch if the copyright is wrong? 

No. The diagnostic severity is Warning, so it'll work quietly for everything except command line and CI builds where warnings are treated as errors."
"It feels like there is something wrong around isExplicitlyNullable handling in this function. For example, why is this the right thing to do to drop isExplicitlyNullable on the final conversion?  #Pending"
"> I didn't realise there were any issues building the E2ETests project. That sounds serious and we would want to know if that goes wrong. I don't think we should be suppressing that kind of problem (e.g., maybe it reflects some actual SDK issue).

Yeah its usually some variation of something in the basictest app being filed locked, sometimes when compression, sometimes during other build steps. We've had that issue for a long time in some form or another, I saw it on a few builds recently (both locally) and on CI"
"Tagging @github/analyzer-ioperation I think something is wrong here.

From my understanding the area delineated by `<bind>` comment should be a syntax node of the right kind (`VerifyOperationTreeAndDiagnosticsForTest<TSomeSyntaxNode>(...`.
I'd expect the printed IOperation tree to be an assignment, with left being a sub-tree and right being a literal 1.

Try `VerifyOperationTreeAndDiagnosticsForTest<AssignmentExpressionSyntax>(...` instead? #Resolved"
">joinClause.InExpression [](start = 36, length = 23)

It is wrong to put this expression into a nested ```for each```, it should be evaluated only once #Closed"
"thse should not be argument excpetions.  If someone is passing along the wrong kinds, we should fix them.  If this is just trying to assert that we're getting the right type, then just throw `ExceptionUtilities.UnexpectedValue`"
"what would be behavior when a file contains multiple namespace? it doesn't offer the fix? bunch of tests related to namespace changes, but except the wrong folder name (not valid identifier name), I wonder what other tests are that are specific to sync folder name. 

also, might be good to have uni-code folder name?"
"This change looks suspicious but I also don't think it's wrong. "
"1. What is `NumberOfIncrementalIterations` for?
2. Why does the test pass in `.CodeActionEquivalenceKey`.  That seems wrong.  The test shouldn't  have to know what equivalence key was used.  That is strictly an internal detail."
"context and cancellationToken together are redundant (since context has the cancellationToken).  I removed the latter, esp. so we don't accidentally pass the wrong one along."
"If you look at the [`testResults.xml`](https://helixre107v0xdeko0k025g8.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet-runtime-refs-pull-37494-merge-aff2f1d493a6477ba2/System.Net.Http.Functional.Tests/testResults.xml?sv=2019-02-02&se=2020-07-16T16%3A03%3A21Z&sr=c&sp=rl&sig=YWnQckHeslN6pPz6S61ceHkC787bizoNtwC9Wn%2FZsF8%3D), the failed test took almost 2 minutes (`method=""Send_CancelledRequestContent_Throws"" time=""105.6715878""`).

"Thanks very much Martin.

And thank you for finding those issues. My apologies.

I'm embarrassed by the first one. As you say, the problem is in `isBlocked` using the old positions.
Now that the code is in a branch in the Microsoft repository I don't know how I should submit a correction. I think the following would be a minimal change to fix that bug. In foldingRange.ts replace:
```
    if (!isBlocked(hiddenRange.startLineNumber, hiddenRange.endLineNumber)) {
        let decRange = this._textModel.getDecorationRange(this._editorDecorationIds[i]);
        if (decRange
          && decRange.startColumn === Math.max(decRange.endColumn - 1, 1)

```
by
```
    let decRange = this._textModel.getDecorationRange(this._editorDecorationIds[i]);
    if (decRange && !isBlocked(decRange.startLineNumber, decRange.startLineNumber + hiddenRange.endLineNumber - hiddenRange.startLineNumber)) {
        if (decRange.startColumn === Math.max(decRange.endColumn - 1, 1)

```
The second problem is tougher. Typing into a collapsed range seems wrong and I could argue either way for whether the new text should remain visible or not.  Maybe a third choice, should the range automatically unfold when a user does that?  

It gets nastier. Suppose that the first line of a folded region, the one which remains visible, is something like `if (xxx) { // do something`. If the user hits enter in front of the `{` the resulting hidden region should be different than if they use enter after it. And the same is true of the terminating line if it looks like `    } // the end`

I played around with making the decoration region include a larger block of the text and things are still problematic that way. The best overall result seems to come from starting the decoration at the last character + 1 of the region and ending it at the first character of the line following the region. But it isn't perfect, especially when considering the cases mentioned above. And I'm not sure about possible consequences to other parts of the editor from having large decoration ranges hanging around.

I want to mull this over a bit. Maybe there's a simpler way.

By the way, do you recall the reason for the ""isBlocked"" test? I.e. under what conditions there can end up being an active selection point inside a hidden range when ""update"" is called?

"We normally embed a known serialization of the class and compare the generated serialization with it. This code doesn't correctly validate the generated XML as DCS cares about ordering and this validation code will pass even if things are in the wrong order. If DCS expects the order A,B,C and the XML has elements ordered as B,A,C, the value of A won't get set. When it sees B, it goes through the list of potential consuming fields and matches for B. When it sees A, it starts at B in the list and doesn't find a consuming data member. This has a reasonable chance of currently being broken as DCS serializes alphabetically when using DataMember. You probably need to add the Order property on the attributes."
"We can end up starting with the wrong value, but it doesn't really concern me for several reasons:
1. The trigger for starting with the wrong state involves opening a document, and no matter what option is supposed to be used we know the open document is going to be analyzed.
2. The fallback default is the default state for the IDE as a whole. This is a rarely-changed option, so for most users we start in the correct state no matter what.
3. For the majority of cases where the current solution differs from the default state, the solution state includes _more_ analysis content than the default, so even if the value starts out wrong the IDE will not reach a transient state on the way to steady-state where more diagnostics are shown than desired."

"You are correct, is a #ifdef but the code would compile since we are just defining the new delegate to be called AVAudioSourceNodeRenderHandler2 now, but not in the future, so we have:

* AVAudioSourceNodeRenderHandler - Once XAMCORE_4 is defined.

The description of the compat files is correct, but in this case we are not create a method for compatibility reasons, but because it was wrong, so I personally would leave the handler definition were it is, with the fixed sample code I gave. In this case, code locality is important, we keep the delegate signature with the API definition.

tldr; We put inside a #ifdef XAMCORE_4 all those API fixes that we would like to do, but we can since it will break the API. One time, in the future, we will be allow to do it, and we will have nicer APIs. I've heard we had several, but I've never seen one, but XAMCORE_2 etc.. exist."

"Yes, it's partially wrong, I think. I'm not sure if this is an impossible code path or not, because local functions cannot be generic at the moment. So `symbol` can't ever be a `SubstitutedMethodSymbol`. I think this is code left over from an initial attempt at generic local functions, but I'm not sure - I'll check tomorrow when I'm back at my computer (and delete it if it's unused). In any case, this area will get rewritten once generic local functions are fully allowed.

"Removed that part. Find out in FileCleanupTestBase path was wrong for osx, updated that."
"Definitely not a dumb question, and I'm not even sure I understand it myself. :-)

Here's what I understand: `GenTreeCall` has three different fields that store nodes related to args: `gtCallThisArg`, `gtCallArgs` and `gtCallLateArgs`. The two former fields are what I call ""early args"" here while the latter is the ""late args"".
Before morph, the latter is not used, the early args just store the operand nodes for the call. Life is good.
`fgMorphArgs`, as part of morph, is responsible for setting calls up for the optimization/backend to handle, and among other things handles ABI details of how to pass the argument in either registers or on the stack. 

This comes with a constraint: we cannot start placing values in registers (and for non-x86, on the stack) before we have evaluated the arguments, if the arguments contain calls. To handle these cases morph will replace the early arguments with evaluation nodes that evaluate the argument into a temp, and then the temp will be put in the late args. In some cases no evaluation is necessary (e.g. for a simple constant) and the operand will end up either in the early or late args, depending on whether it is going on the stack or in registers.

So for a call like `GetThis().M(Arg1(), 10, Arg2())` we end up transforming something like
```scala
GT_CALL
  gtCallThisArg: GT_CALL GetThis
  gtCallArgs[0]: GT_CALL Arg1
  gtCallArgs[1]: GT_CNS_INT 10
  gtCallArgs[2]: GT_CALL Arg2
```
into
```scala
GT_CALL
  gtCallThisArg: GT_ASG tmp0 (GT_CALL GetThis)
  gtCallArgs[0]: GT_ASG tmp1 (GT_CALL Arg1)
  gtCallArgs[1]: GT_ARGPLACE
  gtCallArgs[2]: GT_ASG tmp2 (GT_CALL Arg2)
  gtCallLateArgs[0]: GT_LCL_VAR tmp0
  gtCallLateArgs[1]: GT_LCL_VAR tmp1
  gtCallLateArgs[2]: GT_CNS_INT 10
  gtCallLateArgs[3]: GT_LCL_VAR tmp2
```

For stack arguments we might not need any entry in `gtCallLateArgs`, so there isn't a 1-1 correspondence between args and late args.

The code in lower is then responsible for creating the nodes to actually place these args into the stack/registers. Morph has pretty much done all the work at this point so this is just creating `GT_PUTARG_REG` and `GT_PUTARG_STK` nodes and inserting them after the corresponding args in the early/late args lists. These particular nodes is what this comment is talking about: it moves them further down than they would normally be, since it needs to insert a call very late (after evaluation of the call target that comes after the late args nodes)."
"> It's not a regression as the same inputs give you the same outputs but as a user this now reads wrong to me and I think an ArgumentException would be better suited now.

There are many places where if the code were being written from scratch we would choose to use a different exception type than is currently being used.  But changing from a more derived type to one of its base types is a breaking change, and so we need a good reason to do so."
This seems to be going in the wrong direction - a declaration shouldn't block an assignment to that same property
The removal of this error is still wrong.
Update: this _is_ currently wrong (that’s why tests are failing)—although I’m pretty sure some iteration of this logic worked yesterday—but it’s quite difficult to discern exactly what kind of symbol appears in the `symbols` array here; it seems like sometimes it’s the `localSymbol` and sometimes it’s the `exportSymbol`. Still investigating and revising this section.
"> This is not a connection aborted by the peer but ourselves. So INVALID_STATE here is expected,

Because the connection is aborted by us, then I as a user would expect all pending operations to throw `QuicOperationAbortedException`, in line with https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/55619 (as currently outlined).

> user is doing something wrong.

If by the user you mean the test code above, then I disagree. The connection is accessed from a single thread, and opening the stream was attempted before trying to close the connection. I can imagine that in a real use case, there would be more logic between the call to OpenStreamAsync and CloseAsync (behind some condition). There is no data race evident in the user code. If we start throwing `QuicException` with `INVALID_STATE`, we start leaking implementation details.

> I'm rather surprised we get sometimes ABORTED.

Side note: this can happen while we are waiting for the stream limit to increase (i.e. PEER_ACCEPTED event) and peer closes the connection on us."
"So i don't want unnecessary _work_ to be done in the registration method.  i.e. don't do things that are _expensive_ and not needed until the fix is actually applied.

What can be in the registration method is:
1. Any work necessary to determine which code fixes to provide.  For example, if multiple fixes may be given, but those fixes are conditioned on tests you need to perform.  Ideally this work is cheap.
2. Extracting out appropriate data _cheaply_ from teh context menu to pass to the fixes.

The reason i don't like passing the context around is that there's a good chance the wrong cancellation token will be used.  (even i've made that mistake).

So the ideal code here for me would be:

``` c#
c => await AddBracesAsync(context.Whatever, context.Whatever, ..., c);
```

Then AddBracesAsync only has what it needs, and only sees one potential cancellation token.  
"
"I don't think this is the appropriate fix. I think the right fix is to make sure that nobody is actually passing in `undefined`, so find the type assertions that are wrong."
"So the problem is as follows:
1. Our per language options only allow us to set a default across all languages.  
2. We don't want the default for this option to be either true or false.  Each of those is wrong for one of our two primary languages.
3. So this is actually a tri-state.  'null' means 'language default'.  'true' and 'false' means ""the user chose these explicit values.

We use this pattern for all options that differ in their defaults between C# and VB.  It allows us to have a 'default' that still gets the right legacy/historical behavior for these two languages.

Outside of the message you answered being a year and a half old, the problem isn't ""should the design be X"" or ""should the design be Y"", but rather that the TS team appears unwilling to even engage to find a way forward.

Of course if standardizing the JSON format was the only way to get this merged it'd already have been done - but the last message from them was from October 2020, was based on incorrect information, was never publicly reevaluated once corrected, and didn't include any actual action item (such as ""we like the idea, we'll merge it if you rework it so that X / Y / Z criterias are met"").

In fact, it didn't even explicitly request a change in this PR to make it JSON-based, rather suggesting that this use case should be fulfilled via a plugin system that evidently won't see the light of day anytime soon.

From my perspective, the only thing to do that would actually help bringing PnP support to TS  would be for teams *within Microsoft* to actually use it and advocate for it, as it's rather clear it won't be a priority until then. From the outside unfortunately, there isn't much to do but to wait and periodically rebase this PR. Of course I'd love to be proven wrong! I really like TS and the work its maintainers have been doing, outside of this difficult contributing experience.

*(Note that I've been considering standardizing the JSON format in the next major, Yarn 4, precisely because Esbuild's maintainer expressed some interest into supporting it if we did so. But as far as TS is concerned this is largely irrelevant, because the real issue is the lack of feedback loop. For all I know they may even have silenced this thread.)*"
"I could be wrong, but I don’t _think_ that will be the case. `exportStar.declarations` should be filled by the binder in source order, and then you’d try to resolve the module (`resolveExternalModuleName`) of each one in order... the order of checking might determine whether those resolutions have already happened before, but I don’t see how that would affect the results you see when checking declarations in source order."

With TrimRootCertificate=false, the old logic would incorrectly increase count when chain.Build() return partial chain. That would later cause ArgumentOutOfRangeException when iterating through the chain certificate collection.

Further more, the TrimRootCertificate is swapped. If we want to trim root we need to subtract 2 (e.g. root itself and leaf cert) This will cause wrong number of certificates sent on the wire on Unix. (on Windows all the logic is bolted to OS) 

To fix this, I refactor the code a little bit. There is no need to invoke the partial chain logic at all if we are going to give whole chain to OS (Windows)  

I added variant to SslStream_UntrustedCaWithCustomCallback_OK and verified it will expose the ArgumentOutOfRangeException without the fix.

"So I'm trying to run some benchmarks on this and am having difficulty.

I setup two separate copies of this repo on my machine, one for the main branch and one for my branch. I was able to build each of these eventually after several errors but a `git clean -dfx` helped. Then I followed the guide from the performance repo at https://github.com/dotnet/performance/blob/master/src/benchmarks/micro/README.md#private-runtime-builds and got a bunch of errors saying dotnet 6.0 is not supported by the SDK. I then added the path to main branch repo's dotnet.exe to my environment variables and was able to get the benchmarks to run but they failed with my branch's changes. Am I doing things wrong?"
"> Modern kernels are really good at recognizing file access patterns, we don't get anything from this hint.

There's 0% benefit on any Windows system with any file system?  I question whether that's actually the case.  Should we simply change the implementation to only specify this on Windows, since there it's (I believe, please correct me if I'm wrong) free whereas we need to make an additional syscall on Unix and thus it really needs to be worth its weight?"

I haven't looked at IIS's behavior, so I could be wrong here. But it seems to me by looking at the existing buggy code that QueryStringAppend was meant apply to the pattern and QueryStringDelete was meant to apply to the request query string.


Configuration | Behavior
-- | --
Append = false; Delete = true | No query string ever. Works today.
Append = false; Delete = false | Only request query string. Works today.
Append = true; Delete = false | Merge query string. Works today.
Append = true; Delete = true | Only pattern query string. Still broken.

That said. If you wanted to strip the query string from the pattern, you could just not include a query string in the pattern. It would be a lot simpler if QueryStringAppend controlled whether or not to keep the request query string and have the pattern query string always appended if present. I'm not sure if this is compatible with IIS's behavior though.

"There are two things: 

1) Is it true that `var s = new MemoryStream();` is equivalent with `MemoryStream? s = new MemoryStream();`?

"> I do think we should consider not changing the behavior here, but still annotating these as non-nullable (as proposed above).

We should not do that.  Either we're confident that no concrete implementations will return null (either explicitly or because they don't override the base method and get the base's null-returning behavior), or we're not.  If we're confident it never happens, then the methods can be non-nullable and can be changed to throw.  If we're not confident, then annotating them as non-nullable but returning null is making things worse: we're claiming to consumers they can trust they'll never get back null, but that's simply not true.

Just to make sure it's clear, too, concrete providers can be annotated to return non-nullable even when the base virtual is null-returning.  So, for example, even if we have:
```C#
public abstract class DbProviderFactory
{
    public virtual DbCommand? CreateCommand() => null;
    ...
}
```
we can still have:
```C#
public sealed class SqlClientFactory : DbProviderFactory, IServiceProvider
{
    public override DbCommand CreateCommand() => new SqlCommand();
}
```
Anyone using SqlClientFactory directly would see that CreateCommand returns a non-nullable DbCommand; only when using the base provider would they see that it returns nullable.

We also don't need to do the same thing for every method in question.  The ones we're talking about are these 8?
```C#
public abstract class DbProviderFactory
{
    public virtual DbCommand CreateCommand() => null; 
    public virtual DbCommandBuilder CreateCommandBuilder() => null;
    public virtual DbConnection CreateConnection() => null;
    public virtual DbConnectionStringBuilder CreateConnectionStringBuilder() => null;
    public virtual DbDataAdapter CreateDataAdapter() => null;
    public virtual DbParameter CreateParameter() => null;
    public virtual CodeAccessPermission CreatePermission(PermissionState state) => null;
    public virtual DbDataSourceEnumerator CreateDataSourceEnumerator() => null;
}
```
plus
```C#
public abstract class DbConnection
{
    protected virtual DbProviderFactory DbProviderFactory => null;
}
```
right?

Looking at https://source.dot.net and https://referencesource.microsoft.com/, I see every single code path that ends up hitting this (generally via DbProviderFactories.GetProvider) then null checks the result and throws if null was returned.  And looking around on github, I see lots of code that just assumes it's not null and dereferences the result without checking.  So (and please correct me if I'm wrong), that other than the type itself using its own protected override, null being returned is already effectively considered an error.  If that's true, DbConnection.DbProviderFactory could be made non-nullable and changed to throw with minimal impact.

Looking just at dotnet/runtime, neither `OdbcFactory` nor `OleDbFactory` overrides `CreateDataSourceEnumerator`, so they're going to inherit the base method behavior; same for `EntityProviderFactory` in reference source.  Even if we were to ""fix"" those, that's a key indicator that other implementations are unlikely to override it either.  So that needs to be `DbDataSourceEnumerator?`.

Code Access Security is deprecated, so `CreatePermission` doesn't really matter.  It can return `CodeAccessPermission?` and if folks get warnings, great, they should stop using it.  Even without that, though, I see implementations not overriding it and thus inheriting the base null-returning implementation, e.g. https://github.com/Glimpse/Glimpse/blob/master/source/Glimpse.Ado/AlternateType/GlimpseDbProviderFactory.cs.

You mentioned that ""CreateCommandBuilder and CreateDataAdapter return null on Microsoft.Data.Sqlite"" (as can CreatePermission and CreateDataSourceEnumerator, per https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core/SqliteFactory.cs).  If they return null for such a prominent implementation, that's a warning sign.  On to of that, if memory serves these were introduced later than the other methods, which means implementations based on the original DbProviderFactory surface area wouldn't have overridden these because they didn't exist; that's exemplified in examples like https://github.com/mysql-net/MySqlConnector/blob/master/src/MySqlConnector/MySqlConnectorFactory.cs and https://github.com/jonwagner/Insight.Database/blob/master/Insight.Database.Core/DbConnectionWrapperProviderFactory.cs, where these methods won't be overridden when targeting surface area like .NET Standard 1.6 or .NET Core 1.1.  So... CreateCommandBuilder and CreateDataAdapter should return nullable.

Here's an implementation that doesn't override either CreateParameter or CreateConnectionStringBuilder:
https://github.com/CollaboratingPlatypus/PetaPoco/blob/development/PetaPoco/OracleProvider.cs
And another:
https://github.com/cyq1162/cyqdata/blob/master/DAL/NoSql/NoSqlFactory.cs
And another that doesn't override CreateConnectionStringBuilder:
https://github.com/Lifeng-Liang/DbEntry/blob/master/src/Leafing.MockSql/RecorderFactory.cs
And here's one that explicitly returns null from CreateConnectionStringBuilder:
https://github.com/Dogwei/Swifter.Json/blob/master/Swifter.Data/ProxyProviderFactory.cs
and here's one that doesn't override anything other than CreateCommand or CreateConnection:
https://github.com/ChrisFulstow/NBlog/blob/e50a75d83a85e9a31e2ab7fc1a1c8fa7d29e1fa7/NBlog.Web/Models/PetaPoco.cs#L2175-L2207

I couldn't find any implementations that returned null from CreateConnection/CreateCommand.  Maybe we could get away with making those two non-nullable and throwing from the base.

If all of the above makes sense, that would leave us with:
```C#
public abstract class DbProviderFactory
{
    public virtual DbCommand CreateCommand();
    public virtual DbConnection CreateConnection();

    public virtual DbCommandBuilder? CreateCommandBuilder();
    public virtual DbConnectionStringBuilder? CreateConnectionStringBuilder();
    public virtual DbDataAdapter? CreateDataAdapter();
    public virtual DbParameter? CreateParameter();
    public virtual CodeAccessPermission? CreatePermission(PermissionState state);
    public virtual DbDataSourceEnumerator? CreateDataSourceEnumerator();
}

public abstract class DbConnection
{
    protected virtual DbProviderFactory DbProviderFactory { get; }
}
```
but I'd like more data from @github's data sources, if possible.  And with most of the above returning nullable, it may just make sense to do the simple / honest / non-breaking thing, and return nullable from all of them, reflecting exactly the implementation we have today."

"I think the change here brings us into conformance with the [spec](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/59789#issuecomment-1054568347).

"Sad face...
I guess we could make that work with a fix which I think Mateo actually implemented at one point - the piece of code you asked about (why do we add CoreLib to TPA  at the end, always). We could tweak that to add CoreLib to TPA in the 3.0 compat case (it is currently disabled when CoreLib exists in the bundle, because we expect it to be loaded from the bundle - which is technically wrong)."

@github : I hate to disappoint you but it would appear the native documentation for `gethostname` is wrong. However I can reliably say it does not return the NetBIOS name of the computer and I can find only three possible hostnames that can be set (and can rule out one of them from the comparatively-recent touch to the documentation) so it has to be the remaining one so that's the one I retrieved.

<hr />

Consider the following method signature:

```cs
public static Tuple<Tuple<string?, string?>, string> Field2() { }
```

Attempting to interpret the nullability attributes of `Field2`, it will report that the final `string` is nullable when in fact it is not.  For a complete demonstration, please view this file:

https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet/blob/f190a1566f61f29e1909fe6b7dcbb7140c404908/src/GraphQL.Tests/NRTTests.cs

The problem is that when enumerating the generic type definitions of `Tuple<Tuple<string?, string?>, string>`, and specifically the first generic type `Tuple<string?, string?>`, the code does not increment the index of the nullability byte in the metadata by 3 (non-null, nullable, nullable) but instead only increments it by 1.  So it reads the wrong byte value from the attribute.

I have changed the `GetNullabilityInfo` private method to accept a `ref` index argument so that it can update the index properly based on the number of nested types (and whether or not those nested types utilize a nullability byte, since non-generic value types do not).

I would be happy to add tests, but I'm not sure where in the codebase to do so.

Normally this does not manifest because (it seems?) the JIT does not report dying GC pointer registers until after calls, so the wrong internal view is not really published.
Simple solution for now is to avoid reporting dying GC regs for the validation helper, but it would also be nice to fix the wrong internal view in the JIT."

Index Of depends on the collation which does sorting. What you have mentioned is not true. 

Maybe in your case, consider using Ordinal options instead.

"Further reading now leads me to believe that finalizers don't run ""during"" a GC where the runtime might suspend threads, but that finalization merely triggered by the collection adding objects-waiting-to-be-finalized to the finalizer queue. So the object being finalized is still alive as far as GC is concerned until the object is dequeued from the finalizer queue by the finalizer thread and the object is no longer referenced (that is *if* the object is no longer referenced). When collections are actually run, even the finalizer thread is suspended at least if concurrent garbage collection is disabled.

This is making me think that the effort we go through to reconstruct the MemoryPoolBlock might not be worth it, and that we should just add `this` back to the pool in the finalizer and ""resurrect"" the MemoryPoolBlock. We'd probably need call GC.ReRegisterForFinalize though.

"I'm on the fence about ValueTask. On one hand, RequestDelegate doesn't return a ValueTask and we're not returning an async *value* so we can just use Task.CompletedTask where appropriate. On the other hand, ValueTask gives us the most flexibility if we ever want to try anything crazy like returning pooled tasks for async operations. Of course, that's only worthwhile if whoever is awaiting the action doesn't immediately convert the ValueTask to a Task like the middleware pipeline would.

What potential IResults are you thinking of that don't write a response? I know StatusCodeResult for example doesn't flush the response so something could completely change the response afterwards, but in practice it's effectively writing a response with the specified status code and an empty body the vast majority of the time.

I know technically an IResult could do nothing or anything, but I think naming the method after what it does the majority of the time makes sense. Are there use cases for IResult that have nothing to do with the response that I'm not considering?"

"I think we might need to be more restrictive in how we detect the pseudoselector. It would be a breaking change. 

Today we support selectors like “.myelems::first-of-type .another”.

Would it work to just detect “ends with ::after” but not otherwise look for :: appearing anywhere?

Sorry I was wrong saying we could throw if there are unrecognised pseudoselectors. We can’t if we want to continue allowing things like ::last-child etc. 

I think it will be ok to just recognise ::after at the very end of the string. It would also be nice to specifically recognise ending with ::before and throw since otherwise people might get confused. Those two didn’t have any supported meaning before so that’s non breaking. But other pseudoselectors could be ignored. 

Does that sound reasonable?"

There is no documentation on how this process spawning works.  Assuming it just looks for the correct process next to it.  But I'm unsure if it correctly passes along the `--accepteula` flag.  If it didn't it would result in a Jenkins hang.  Seems wrong to fix a jenkins hang with a jenkins hang.  So just maknig it simple here and picking the right architecture.

Would be willing to undo this if we could find some docs that point to `--acepteula` being passed along correctly.  Can't test locally though because I've already accepted it.

"@github I don't see record of a discussion about trying to catch this with an analyzer. It's not generally possible to be sure (either way) whether it's unbounded. But an analyzer that forced a pattern of passing a constant value would be doable.

Looking at all our stackallocs, almost all of them already pass a constant directly or via a constant field or local. The few exceptions are not self evidently safe by eyeball, eg.,
```c#
        private static unsafe int EncryptDecryptHelper(OP op, ISSPIInterface secModule, SafeDeleteContext context, Span<SecurityBuffer> input, uint sequenceNumber)
        {
            Interop.SspiCli.SecBufferDesc sdcInOut = new Interop.SspiCli.SecBufferDesc(input.Length);
            Span<Interop.SspiCli.SecBuffer> unmanagedBuffer = stackalloc Interop.SspiCli.SecBuffer[input.Length];
```
and it would be easy for one of them to be wrong. Would it be reasonable to have an analyzer that required them to be rewritten in constant terms, or at least something the analyzer could recognize like
```c#
            Span<Interop.SspiCli.SecBuffer> unmanagedBuffer = stackalloc Interop.SspiCli.SecBuffer[Math.Min(input.Length, BufferSize)];

1. I'm in English-US locale

```

5. I change my locale to Spanish-MX
6. My defaults.json and settings.json are unchanged
7. To use commandline args, I need to call `wt -p ""Command Prompt - Spanish Edition""` (but like, with the actual localized string)

Separately, what I'm confused about is, can't we just use your `%Version%` code from before? Just add a `%CmdName%`, then replace it with a localized name? This would fail on everything past step 5, but is that an important scenario?

And we wouldn't have to worry about `wt -p ""<localized cmd name>""` because we search through the profiles be a normal name, so that'd be ok?"
"Ah, sorry for the confusion. I meant to suggest using the include path *instead* of adding the extra `#include` lines.

"It's safe to assume that strings are immutable. __However__, code paths like this have a tendency to get refactored such that their inputs become `ROS<char>` instead of `string`, and at that point all immutability guarantees are void.

That said, what's the worst thing that can happen if the span contents end up changing mid-operation? We accidentally read the wrong directory names, maybe resulting in an i/o error and exception? That's probably ok, not the end of the world. We accidentally read off the end of a buffer and start corrupting memory? That's unacceptable.

So if we pessimistically assume that the contents may be mutable in a future release, and we also think that the consequences of something being mutated out from under us isn't really all that bad, then I wouldn't worry too much about it. :)

As an example of this in action, see [`string.Replace`'s implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/10e107debae28de4bd1e710cfe448be3c293e841/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/String.Manipulation.cs#L1055), which uses an index-based approach as you ponder here, and which does not defend against mutation. If it ever gets refactored to depend on `ROS<char>`, worst case behavior is that we'll end up inserting improper substitutions into the output string. But we _won't_ run off the end of the buffer and corrupt memory. So it's not worth putting a guard in here."

"Oh, got it. The fallback would be “ignore.” There are a number of preferences/rules that have a disclaimer about what version of TypeScript they require. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s not ideal.

It just gives me an uncomfortable squirmy feeling thinking about an option that means, “I want you to fix up all my semicolons, but I _don’t_ want to tell you how I like them!”

Of course, that has a highly practical application: “Please adapt my semicolon habits to match whatever project I happen to be working on right now.” But, that request may as well apply to _every_ formatter option, not just semicolon preference. As such, I think this is the wrong venue to try to solve the problem of “I work on a bunch of different projects with different formatting conventions.”"
"This pattern seems like quite the verbose way of saying:
```
assert(c->m_typ == TYP_SIMD);

```
I don't think we need to return zero in release build in case something calls this with a wrong type, it will be broken either way."
Not crazy about this *always* being there.
"There are two main things here:

1. The IDE will have no way to disambiguate and so it doesn't matter what we put in source. `nint` will be displayed by the tooling. These types in ECMA-335 (runtime spec) were never designed to be different. C# decided to disambiguate them while other languages, such as F# did not. C# trying to disambiguate them turned this into a massive leaky abstraction where its trying to express a difference that doesn't actually exist, which definitely doesn't exist in several other languages, and which fundamentally breaks down the more `System.IntPtr` gets used and gets support for integer like operations.

2. People having a pre-conceived notion that `IntPtr` means ""pointer like"" is wrong and needs to be changed. This is and always has been an incorrect association and is one that extends beyond the boundaries of just .NET. `IntPtr` comes from C/C++ where the corresponding name `intptr_t` exists. It is in the same format and of the same meaning as `Int32`. That is `Int` meaning `integer` and `32` meaning `32-bits`. Therefore `IntPtr` is `Int` meaning `integer` and `ptr` meaning `ptr-bits` (same width as a pointer).

The official guidance and what the `System.IntPtr` docs are being updated to indicate is that while you can use `IntPtr` to expose/represent/pass pointers and handles, this is unsafe and error prone. Usage needs to be carefully considered and primarily done in cases where the corresponding language doesn't have pointer support. In languages that support them handles and pointers should be represented as pointers or a type-safe wrapper (such as by correctly deriving `SafeHandle`). Trying to represent a `ushort*` as an `IntPtr` is unsafe, as is trying to represent a `HWND` as an `IntPtr`. Sometimes this is appropriate for interop code, but even there it is ""technically incorrect"" and could run into ABI issues on future platforms.

We should definitely follow our own guidance where it isn't a breaking change. But otherwise, the few remaining cases where it is a pointer being exposed ""safely"", people will get adjusted to the difference with time and it will be ultimately no different than seeing `intptr_t`, `uintptr_t`, or one of the many other typedefs in C/C++ which have the same meaning."
"That walks upward, which is the wrong direction. I need to remove the parens, not walk up from the inside to the outermost parens."
"> If you throw an exception you can also test the behavior on incorrect inputs.

What is an incorrect input?  How do we test that?  The point is that we don't know for certain exactly how the compiler works here.  If we could generate these inputs we would just test these cases and make the code work.

This is about how to write code that isn't sure about all the possible cases that can come through and isn't 100% sure how the compiler will treat things (since it's not documented).  

So we write to what we hope is happening, but we are resilient to being wrong.  As above, i'm fine with telemetry/watson here as that's just a feedback channel.  I'm not fine with a crash/throw/contract as those do not fit.  Reporting a contract violation about a non-violated contract is not correct. "

"Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I can see the existing code that is being improved here isn't optimal in the first place. We don't have to make the hashing faster if we remove the need for expensive hashing.

Reasons:
* The only place where `_textFormatMap` is being used is inside `DxFontRenderData::TextFormatWithAttribute`
* `_textFormatMap` is cleared when the font changes and can only contain a single font ❗
* `_textFormatMap` lookup only occurs with `weight`, `style` and `stretch` (let's abbreviate it as ""WSS"")

My personal conclusion:
The hash function for `_textFormatMap` only needs to hash WSS and that's it. We can improve the performance of hashing by inlining the FNV1a algorithm, which requires around 4ns for 12 bytes (the amount of data we need to hash) in my experience. If we use xxHash we can reduce it to 1-2ns.

Yes, in fact that was the original version of the fix, and the only place I had to fix was the importer. I went back and forth on this a few times, and ultimately decided to have the change initially be with this more conservative implementation, because it is ""guaranteed"" (not really because I did not add it to the constructor, but nothing calls the constructor directly) to always return ""correct"" result to the caller.

"I wanted to cache results in `createJsxAttributesTypeFromAttributesProperty` (as it's called at least twice for each overload resolved through JSX), but it _could_ be called in a contextual context (and often is), in which case caching indeterminate results would be bad. I'm not in for putting ad-hoc checks on cache safety at every use-site - I'd rather `checkExpressionCached` make it impossible to do the wrong thing."
"I've just quickly checked which tests are failing when unwrapping is commented out and seeing following types of failures we check for (84 tests failures total in System.Text.Json.Tests alone):
- property/element/key type is not valid for serialization - this is happening when converter is determined and converter is required for constructing JsonTypeInfo
- while determining properties: invalid naming policies etc. - this could potentially be delayed although it cannot be moved to `Configure` - the latest we can move that to is when user first time accesses properties (we will have to do that for source gen already)
- invalid converter (i.e. different converter type that property type) - again this should be done during construction
- extension property is of wrong type - this could also potentially be slightly delayed (to first time accessing properties)
- invalid property type
- couple of other sanity errors (i.e. combining number handling with custom converter for numbers)
I'll stop checking here.

Given above I don't think it can really be delayed. Also note that this is happening only during construction of JsonTypeInfo which is a one time operation"

"Briefly: no.

This logic could be wrong in two ways. It could return false when it should return true; it could miss a `this.x` reference nested on the rhs of a binary expression with a `this.x` lhs. Making this code more complex raises the risk of this happening; I can only think of it missing `this[""x""]` right now. Missing a `this.x` reference produces (1) `any` (2) a bogus error, just like today.

Or it could return true when it should return false, which is the case you're pointing out. In this case, a single declaration incorrectly produces `any`, but other declarations will still provide the correct type, which will sometimes result in the right type being assigned to the property.

The penalty for being wrong isn't that bad, and the code is no longer so simple, so I don't think it's worth it, especially since no customers have complained that the *current* behaviour isn't correct."

"Because that's what we merged for `combineUnionParameters` in https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/32056 :V

Also, ""some name is better than arg0"" isn't really true. Names carry semantic meaning, so let's say you have `(index: number) => any` and `(object: Whatever): any ` - calling the result `index` where's it's type is `number | Whatever` has the potential to be misleading. Particularly problematic is when the types are the _same_, but semantically different, like
`(length: number): any[]` and `(firstElement: number): any[]` - yeah, `number` is the type of both, but there're not semantically the same! So calling both ""length"" or ""firstElement"" would be dead wrong. Now, I had a _super old_ version of this that concatenated the names in cases like this, to `lengthOrFirstElement`, but that was shot down as too easily producing names that are unwieldy as unions grow. And thus, the preference for `arg0` was born. It carries no information, thus you can draw no (potentially inaccurate) conclusion as to the usage of the parameter."

I fixed minor problems from review; however I ran into problems dealing with File.Replace. Filed doc issue https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/22288 ; the code might also be wrong in master.
"The problem here is one of readability and cognitive burden just trying to parse out the expression to figure out things like precedence.  For example, just reading this i kept seeing it as:

`!!(node.initializer || isBindingPattern(node.parent)) && hasInitializer(<VariableDeclaration>node.parent.parent);`

I was then stuck for ages going ""why, if the node has an initializer, do you then need to check that the grandparent of the node has an initializer as well?""

Seeing and properly breaking up these complex conditionals is very tricky and easy to get wrong.  Even when finally seeing the appropriate location for the parens, it is then necessary to perform complex lookahead mentally to determine precedence.  For example, when reading this left to right you start with:

""ok, if the node has an initializer _or_ if it is a binding pattern"".  When you then reach the && you have to then go back and figure out what portion the && applies to.   ""oh.  it's on the right of a paren.  Ok.... let me backtrack and find the start paren.  Ok.  Found it.  Now what precedes that.  Was it something with lower or higher priority than what i started with?  Wait.  What did i start with again?"" :)

Now, there are many ways to address this to make the code more readable.  One way is to go the imperative route (which is my personal preferred form most of the time).  However, if that is distasteful, an alternative way is to instead rewrite things like so:

```
    return node.initializer || isBindingPatternWithInitializer(node.parent);
}

function isBindingPatternWithInitializer(node: Node) {
    return isBindingPattern(node) && hasInitializer(<VariableDeclaration>node.parent);
}
```

Now the code is _much_ clearer in how it should be read and how it shoudl be interpreted.   The naming gives an intuition as to what's going on, and there doesn't need to be time spent just trying to break down a complex conditional into something more reasonable in the brain.   It is still simple, functional, boolean expressions.  Just with appropriate clarity added to make comprehending it much simpler.

"@github I just tried on a project that I tried to convert to .NET Core many months ago and I can confirm that it finally works on x86 as well (using ACE/Jet driver).

"When `useDefineForClassFields` is false, `es2022` transforms simple static class fields into class static init blocks. This is a problem for users that need `useDefineForClassFields` ([lit](https://lit.dev) requires this). As well, class fields and class private members are widely supported, where class static init blocks are not. Class fields have smaller bytecounts than transformed output, and are easier to read. I understand that the code is equivalent on an engine which supports static class blocks, but this presents a serious problem for some users, and I think TSC should provide an escape hatch. 

Don't get me wrong, I think static blocks are super cool, and I'm looking forward to using them, but many users will want to use `es2022` to get native [private class members, which are widely supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_classes_private_class_fields), but they'll get stuck with static init blocks that they didn't write in source - [a syntax error in most toolchains and on apple's monopoly engine webkit](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_classes_static_initialization_blocks)

### Short answer

It's all build infrastructure. Well, not quite but&hellip;

### More correct answer

The main changes are in a tool (`RazorSyntaxGenerator`) that does not ship and is only used manually. I am changing a single generated source file but only its contained `#line` pragmas and only to satisfy Roslyn.

### Background

The change corrects build failures I've repeatedly seen locally but aren't yet happening on the CI.

The src/Shared/ErrorPage/ErrorPage.Designer.cs file is checked into the repo and compiled into a number of our projects. Newer versions of Roslyn validate the generated `#line` pragmas in this file and complain when the ErrorPage.cshtml file isn't found because it's in the src/Shared/ErrorPage/Views sub-directory. That is, builds fail because the `#line` pragmas are wrong.

We fixed this in 'master' but haven't done the same in 'release/5.0' yet. This will soon be necessary because the Roslyn compiler ships (in part) with VS and core-eng updates VS on the build agents.

The specific fix is to correct the tool used to generate the ErrorPage.Designer.cs file (`RazorSyntaxGenerator`) and then use it to fix the `#line` pragmas.

An alternate fix would be to move the generated file into the Views sub-directory and then change the references in consuming projects. I chose the current fix because it was somewhat more localized and gave me an opportunity to fix the ""script also did not know `RazorSyntaxGenerator` had moved to this repo"" bit."
"Then is it the case that part of the implementation in the provider is in the wrong place, given that the `ActionDescriptor` itself is created here?

The class modified here implements `IActionDescriptorProvider`, so I don't quite follow the argument that only action descriptor providers should modify it because it is one.

It's also not really modified per se, as it's just completely empty - there is no metadata at all, as it was constructed just a few lines earlier.

The application has no prior access to the `ActionDescriptor` before the method returns because it is the source of it.

If that's still incorrect, then I'll close this PR. In that case though, what is the intended design that would allow the action's metadata to be accessible to the API Explorer for inspection?

I look at that very much as an opening of the barn door: we might be able to close it again, but the horse has already left either way.

Do we have confidence that this fix actually works? Given this is potentially waiting on tasks that have already kicked off or might be using AsyncLazy or something else that isn't JTF-aware in the implementation of ICodeFixService, is JTF able to let the right things through here? My concern here being an independent question of ""is JTF wise?"" but rather ""is JTF actually going to work here given we have an existing body of code that in places is not following JTF rules?""

I don't know if JTF has support built in but we _could_ do something where we have a handshake between the code fix at hand and the Wait() we do on the UI thread to make a SwitchToMainThreadAsync()-like method that is able to run code despite being in that wait. Conceptually something like ""we are blocking jumps to the UI thread, unless you are this specific jump with a specific password, and then we let you through."" Or some custom way to control exactly what is ""let through"". If it doesn't have support we _can_ implement a very constrained system that might meet exactly our needs here (and not try to solve the general problem) which at least means we can barn-door-opening in the general case. In some sense this means we're reinventing JTF but rather than making a general-purpose thing the specific purpose thing can be more precisely targeted. Is this evil? maybe, but it might be an alternative solution worth looking at if we haven't already.

More generally, out-of-proc is on the horizon here; I don't know if there we'd start running everything OOP except for things marked as ""I need to be in-proc"", and if those run with JTF it's already clear they're doing evil and the evilness is already called out."
"My initial thought is no. While it's not useful to have both values, it's not technically wrong. DefaultSourceFileEncoding will always take precedence over FallbackSourceFileEncoding. From the pure perspective of EmitOptions it seems fine, even if the compiler implementation will never use both. "
"`@github`, I think this being wrong would have broken it at runtime?"
"this is all wrong. Behaviors are meant to be declared in Styles, and have shared instances. So your behavior should keep track of an AssociatedObject, but an array of AssociatedObjects.

and then you need to keep a kind of proxy for the bindable context thing, so the bindings are applied.

I'm guilty of this, I'm the one who made Behavior inherit from BindableObject"

That's not a super useful error, `ERROR_DIRECTORY` - I guess that makes sense, though not totally obvious what's wrong here. 

I'm okay with us leaving this for now. We do some validation of the `startingDirectory` on settings load, but nothing for directories passed as commandline args, and I think that's fine.

If we did want to try and pre-validate, we could pull `Profile::EvaluateStartingDirectory` into a helper, and only use the control's directory if it's valid. That's actually probably a good idea."

"I think the existing variable names are falling out of touch with what they mean as we start teasing apart trusted/untrusted builds. To encourage YAML reuse between the trusted and untrusted pipelines, we need this abstraction.

There is no need to conditionally set these variables IMO because there is no circumstance that an untrusted build should run on the untrusted pool (and likewise for the trusted pool). Writing in the condition only increases the chance of having the build get assigned to the wrong pool."
"Ok thank you for explaining.

Do you think it's ok if I remove that test and I instead add a more general test that checks if the scrolling is done correctly, but that no longer checks if the selection and renderer behavior works correctly (see 1508ff1895f94373f22b609a4ee5793f30c47dee)?

Here's why I personally think that it's better: instead of mocking the renderer to check if it received the right values, the test was relying on the fact that the function `_NotifyScrollEvent` was always called right after it sent the scroll delta to the renderer. So the test was relying on an implementation detail, and not actually checking if anything overflows (at least this is what I understand, I may be wrong).

The problem is that because I've changed some code, the assumption that the tests relied on is no longer valid so if I want to keep the test I probably have to refactor it and mock things and I don't think that it's worth it."

"`MarshalDirective` is a workaround we have to work around a calling convention limitation with P/Invokes.

The problem is that certain native types (such as `Vector3`) are not put in the normal registers when used as parameters to methods, instead they're passed in special SIMD registers. Unfortunately managed code (i.e. P/Invokes) doesn't know about this, so we can't call these native methods using P/Invokes because the arguments would be in the wrong registers.

Our workaround is a bit involved: we generate a native wrapper method where the parameters are passed in the expected registers, and that calls the actual native function, so that the native compiler puts the arguments in the right registers. The `MarshalDirective` attribute tells the generator that it should generate a call to the wrapper method instead of the normal P/Invoke (and that the name of the wrapper method is the name of the native function prefixed by `xamarin_simd__`, and the library where the wrapper method is located - `__Internal` means the executable itself)."

"> @github is there any reason we want this to live in the roslyn-analyzers repo vs. just being in the compiler? Considering the compiler is aware of d is double.NaN and translates it into double.IsNaN(d) this feels like a language level issue and not a library issue. Today doing this comparison is always incorrect and I would be very surprised if there was pushback from users here.

It is a wrong statement to classify CA analyzers as just .NET API analyzers. `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers` inserted into the SDK has two big analysis areas:

1. .NET API analyzers
2. Generic code-quality analyzers, which are API agnostic, code quality improvement analyzers.

`CA2242` falls into the second bucket. It has existed for close to a decade, starting in FxCop, then ported to FxCop analyzers and now .NET SDK analyzers. I don't see a good reason to deprecate this ID and move it to the compiler - it seems like lot of unnecessary work for no net gain. I am going to mark this PR as blocked until both the IDE team and compiler team are able to approve that we want to go the route of moving API agnostic CA analyzers into compiler layer."

"> The Function you mentioned will always get different size so there is no there choice. icmp6stats was working for years before breaking change. I could change that if that is consensus but I see that personally as unnecessary complication.

So, the thing here is that in fact, doing it the way it was being done (assuming a specific size, etc.) was *always* unsupported because it will *frequently* have breaking changes. It just was never given sufficiently strong warnings around making assumptions about sizes and locations. The recommended way has always been to use `sysctlbyname()` (which has a near-zero syscall penalty.) 

The actual reason for that requires hopping in your wayback machine and going back about 20 years. Basically, the concept of 'dynamic' sysctls (which may or may not exist) were introduced all the way back there, which shifted the recommendation to `sysctlbyname()` instead of statics on a global basis since `sysctlbyname()` can return `ENOENT` gracefully among other things. However, given it was 20 years ago, it wasn't really documented at all. And nobody ever went back and fixed the lack of documentation. They just got their fingers whacked with a ruler if they did it wrong.

So ultimately, doing it by static map or numeric *actually is the more complicated way* and technically 'the wrong way,' regardless of whether it's a single sysctl or a struct."
"> it now tightly couples the perf on one area to an implementation detail of another value and how it relates inheritance-wise to others

But perf *always* depends on implementation details of any external code and libraries you're using, because those implementation details affect the perf. In the next version of a library, the function you're using might be 2x slower (although realistically, that would usually be treated as a regression in corefx and it's unlikely to happen in the first place because they take perf of every area really seriously and have automated tests to detect any regressions). But still, when you're comparing 2 ways of doing something and you find that 1 of them is faster, in the next version, it could be the other one. So with perf, you're *always* relying on implementation details. That's why I tested this with multiple .NET versions.

Most importantly though, I'm not relying on implementation details with respect to correctness of behavior, only with respect to desirable perf outcomes.

> The cost is on maintainability. Anyone who has to maintain this now needs to hold all this complexity in their head and get things right on framework/core for any changes here in the future. That added complexity is more chance to get things wrong and to introduce subtle issues (like potential corruption).

I really don't see where the complexity or maintainability cost is. You're talking about this piece of code:
```c#
var @github = (TextWriterWriteReadOnlySpanDelegate)textWriter.Write;
if (@github.Method.DeclaringType != typeof(TextWriter))
{
    // Use the Write(ReadOnlySpan<char>) overload only if the method is overriden, because if it's not, the base
    // TextWriter implementation needs to delegate to the array overload and could potentially allocate a really
    // large array, which would be slower than the buffering base implementation.
    textWriter.Write(this.Source.AsSpan(span.Start, span.Length));
}
else
{
    base.Write(textWriter, span, cancellationToken);
}
```
That's literally just 1 condition - to check whether the `TextWriter` *supports* writing directly from a span, and 2 branches based on that, each do the same thing and both 1 line (or rather the second one calls an existing method). I really don't see where the cost is on maintainability. Both branches have the same behavior so if someone edits this someday and gets the condition wrong, it's not like the code will start behaving incorrectly or like there would be any corruption, as you're saying. It would just lose the perf benefit - that's literally it. The behavior would still be correct (and the tests also cover the behavior in both branches). And on top of that, this isn't the kind of method that has to evolve for new language features etc. This just copies a piece of data. This is the kind of code that is written once and usually stays the same because it doesn't need to evolve or change.

I'm kinda surprised by this. In dotnet/aspnetcore and especially dotnet/runtime, they routinely add all sorts of convoluted and hard to read code with many branches and different implementations to achieve perf benefits in any public API. This is really *nothing* compared to that. This is just one condition and 2 equally simple branches. I just don't see the complexity. I guess the recent perf enthusiasm in .NET hasn't reached Roslyn as much 😔

> Specifically, these types are already complex. To the point that it makes implementing language features harder

StringText.cs is currently 103 lines (without this PR). And as I mentioned, this isn't really the kind of code that has to evolve for new language features. This just copies a string.

>  I don't believe we do this elsewhere.

That doesn't mean it's complex though. 😳"
">I'm pretty sure there's some other stuff going on with like, turning parts of the value's type into the type in satisfies via contextual typing, most likely exclusively in cases that don't widen it. I might be wrong on that front though? That's stuff I don't really understand besides how to use it haha

That's pretty much exactly the stuff I'm asking about. 😄
Although in hindsight, my example was maybe a bit too simple to dig into it properly. 🤔"

We were hitting an issue in our fork ([this one](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-raiseexception-when-calling-jsonutility-dot-fromjson-with-a-corrupted-json-file)) where a user was deserializing a corrupt managed object and crashing the editor. A discussion on discord with @github lead to interest being expressed in having this change also in mono/mono.

"> it's fine - it's much better than introducing full on new syntax.

@github This is wrong, we're using the `assert` keyword for something that isn't an assertion. Why? You're correct that this is a type-only statement, all the more reason to do literally anything else and not misuse a JS syntax.

There are plenty of other options that make sense without _completely_ new and ts-only syntax e.g.
```ts
// comment directive, nothing new

// @github=require
import type { RequireInterface } from ""pkg"";
```
```ts
// https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-reflection

import type { RequireInterface } from ""pkg"" as ""resolution=require"";
```
```ts
// dangles off the already ts-only part

import type(resolution=require) { RequireInterface } from ""pkg"";
```

Please consider reverting this change."
"From a servicing perspective it's definitely better to dynamically load from the global install. But if these are scenarios where the dll is shipped with app anyway, then it doesn't matter.
There's also the ""how to acquire"" the .lib which is currently not very easy - so it also acts as a barrier for entry (it's much easier to get the .dll then the .lib).

The downside of not providing the header would be if people get it wrong in subtle ways... but I guess that's not that risky.

I'm fine either way."

<hr />

We are implementing Hot Reload feature support during debug session in our debugger (https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg) for Tizen devices. We have Linux/Tizen arm32/arm64/amd64 devices with custom built runtime, that have `FEATURE_ENC_SUPPORTED` defined in order to make deltas apply debugger API part work.

During netcoredbg functional testing, I found, that for Linux arm32  `ICorDebugFunction2::GetVersionNumber` return wrong code version (it return `1` all times), but execute proper (updated by deltas) code in the same time.
This happens for `IcorDebugFunction` received from current frame, that received from provided by callback ICorDebugThread (`IcorDebugManagedCallback::Breakpoint`, `IcorDebugManagedCallback::StepComplete`, …).

I found, that point of issue for Linux arm32 is wrong `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` work, that not return proper `DebuggerJitInfo` (with proper method's code version), since can’t find it due to 
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/ecb4e6c178b98aec29fbf3e7a70a820240c1dd0b/src/coreclr/debug/ee/functioninfo.cpp#L1526
comparation, that all times produce `false`. In case no `DebuggerJitInfo` was found by `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo`, `1` version (initial code version) are used.

During investigation, I found that `m_addrOfCode` in `DebuggerJitInfo` have a THUMB code bit set unconditionally all the time:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/ecb4e6c178b98aec29fbf3e7a70a820240c1dd0b/src/coreclr/debug/ee/debugger.cpp#L2498-L2500
In the same time, `addrNativeStartAddr` THUMB code bit at `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` call is not defined and in case of our issue, have assertion and even unconditionally remove it from address (since this required by other code logic) before `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` (`DacDbiInterfaceImpl::LookupEnCVersions`-> `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` ) call:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/ecb4e6c178b98aec29fbf3e7a70a820240c1dd0b/src/coreclr/debug/daccess/dacdbiimpl.cpp#L1417-L1421

Looks like in `./src/coreclr/debug/ee/debugger.cpp` and `./src/coreclr/debug/ee/functioninfo.cpp` we calls `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` in proper way (with proper addresses in `addrNativeStartAddr` argument) and even have assertion about  THUMB code bit before call:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/ecb4e6c178b98aec29fbf3e7a70a820240c1dd0b/src/coreclr/debug/ee/functioninfo.cpp#L1593-L1594
but other sources call `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` without care about THUMB code bit. In this commit I propose fix `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` itself in order to care about THUMB code bit right before compare addresses.

I tested this changes with our debugger on Linux arm32 and can confirm, this fix arm32 issue in `ICorDebugFunction2::GetVersionNumber`.

"The issue that #5896 fixes is when the manifest AND unpackaged is specified. That PR tried to fix it by not including the manifest, however, this is wrong because the way the PR did it was to check after the nuget had already defaulted to None and thus never included it.

Yes, you can have your own static files middleware and except for the case they are being mapped into the same subpath (or to ""/"") this should not interfere.

In the future, I want to flow the paths into the host so that it can map exactly the files the blazor app is meant to serve and nothing else. At that point there's no room for ever conflicting with the static files middleware."

"Yeah, ""this is null only when some other local state says it will be"" and ""this isn't null when some other local state says it won't be"" are definitely big holes in the logic.

Effectively this type is a discriminated union; and assuming you read the typeID field you now know that the value can't be null.

Similarly with the cert.Get[Alg]PublicKey() methods... if you asked the ""what kind of thing is this"" you already know the nullarity.  We made them return null for the wrong algorithm for simpler flow control (and annoying cases like redundant identifiers)."

"Sorry, I don't understand what's wrong here. I only pop the underlying pointer to pass it to `_AssignChildNode`, which just reads the pointed object and copies it (copies object, not the pointer). It could receive it by reference as well, except it has to be nullable. Or it could receive reference to `unique_ptr` but that's anti pattern in such situations (not to force implementation). And I don't see any two `unique_ptr`s to hold the same value. "
"Feel like there is a missing `throw` statement or assert here. Given that we unconditionally return in the case of a single file (don't do the `NonSourceFiles.Contains` check) there appears to be an implicit assumption the data is correct.

In the case of multiple files though we do extra checking. But shouldn't that extra checking always match a value? It feels like if we get to the end of the `foreach` and have not matched a value then something is wrong here."
"@github @github I am pretty sure this is not what wee wamt longer term.

So the situation is when building natively on osx-arm64, we are currently using the osx-x64 dotnet core.  This means we are running msbuild in a Rosetta process.  When the shell is spawned, it apparently is also spawned in x64 shell. Here uname -m is returning `x64` or `amd64` and we get the wrong arch.  We get the rosetta arch and not the machine arch.

This hack allows CPUName as an environment variable to override `$(uname -m)`

We probably want a better environment variable if we want to go that way.
"
"Don't think the `MemoryBarrier` will provide that. The barrier controls read / write reordering from within a thread. It doesn't do anything to guarantee the synchronization of writes from other threads for this thread. 

Stated another way. Lets say Thread 1 is the one which enters the `if (managedKind ==)` above and T2 skips the if and goes straight to this line. In T1 the order of writes is indeed `_managedKindUseSiteDiagnostics` and then `_flags`. That does not mean the order in which the writes become visible to T2 is the same. The order in which the writes become visible could be `_flags` then `_managedKindUseSiteDiagnostics`. The `MemoryBarrier` doesn't help here because all it does is control the order of read / writes within T2. It doesn't control whether or not those reads are consistent with the writse from T1. 

It's possible I'm remembering part of this wrong but pretty much whenever u have to depend on the ordering of writes between threads there is usually this type of gap.

"### Discussion points
1. How do we feel about `Enter` being bound to `copy()` by default?
   - It's consistent with conhost, and worst-case, people can disable it. I don't expect people to bind `Enter` to anything nowadays anyways.
2. Should we backport a fix for the copy on select stuff?
   - It's a decently sized fix and nobody's complained about it. Ethically, we should, but there is _some_ risk due to the size. I'd basically copy over anything that references `IsInQuickEditMode()`.
3. Also found another ""bug?"" where if you select empty text while copy on select is enabled, we end up copying literally nothing. I'm guessing this is because we switched the default `copy()` behavior to trimming whitespace. Should that be a part of this PR?
   - I vote no. I'm also not sure if we should even commit to fixing this for 1.14 and 1.15. But I could 100% be wrong. Either way, bringing it to your attention.

That partially answers my question about the best way to make the code fix. But is it really desirable to replace this error message? I guess I'm worried about the rare cases where the `remove ()` suggestion is wrong, and then the new error message wouldn't really make sense. Should we try to also preserve the ""not callable"" error (the actual ""root cause""), or do you really think it's best to replace it?"
">> Just add #nullable disable at the top of the test file.

Quite the opposite. In my opinion, using nullable analysis in tests is an overkill. It simply introduces unnecessary overhead on every angle. A test doesn't have to handle every possible scenario. If it doesn't fail, there is nothing to get wrong about nullability, it is focused on a very specific scenario.

"> If we're going to do anything here (and I don't think it's a particularly high yield scenario) we should add additional logic to `getIntersectionType` that reduces intersections of array types and tuple types

This was my first thought as well, but I noticed that dealing with unreduced intersections of arrays and tuples works totally as expected, from an assignability perspective. It’s only during the normalization into another tuple (specifically this last condition where it’s assumed that anything that reaches this branch can just become a rest element of the index type) that things go awry—so while eagerly reducing more intersections would prevent that, it seemed like unnecessary work to me. And while I agree that this is a strange edge case, there are examples that are weird and wrong enough that I thought fixing it would be worthwhile if it didn’t come at the cost of performance (which I need to check). But I guess my test cases didn’t show the worst manifestations of the bug:

```ts
type Intersection = number[] & [""a"", 2, 3];
type Normalized = [...Intersection]; // (3 | 2)[]
```

We can reason that `Intersection` ought to be `never`, and although it does not immediately reduce, the only types that are assignable to it are `never` and 3-length tuples where at least the zeroth element is `never`, which are arguably as good as `never`. And of course, `Intersection` is assignable both to `number[]` and to `[""a"", 2, 3]`. I have no problem with `Intersection` in its non-reduced form.

But after spreading into another tuple, it becomes `(3 | 2)[]`. This breaks the identity that I _think_ should hold, that `[...T]` is equivalent to `T` for any array-like `T`, because `(3 | 2)[]` is not assignable to `[""a"", 2, 3]`. So I’m not sure I see why eager intersection reductions would be necessary when no assignability problems are observable until tuple normalization happens."

When you find-all-refs on a declaration of a symbol that has only 1 non-declaration reference, both VS Code and emacs jump to that lone non-declaration. I think that code must rely on isDefinition too&mdash;at least the emacs code did when I first wrote it in 2016.

In this case, making imports have `isDefinition: true` would mean that find-all-ref would not jump to a single import, but display the usual find-all-refs UI. I think this is fine."
"> superpmi seems to be failing with JIT failed to initialize

superpmi.py has an algorithm for determining the baseline JIT to download from the JIT rolling build and use, but it's fragile as it depends on your branch being branched from a local 'main' branch, so it might be wrong, and in this case, it's probably picked a baseline JIT from before the last JIT/EE GUID change. You can build/download and specify your own baseline, using the `-base_jit_path` argument to `superpmi.py asmdiffs`"
"@github reordering them would certainly be a better choice, but it isn't trivial for me, as I'm no expert in the details of how the JIT really works. As the reverse p/invoke is added to the prolog/epilog in the flowgraph stage, and the inlined call frame logic is handled during lower; however, I'm not comfortable making such a change myself, as the fix looked to be more involved than I was prepared to handle, and prolog/epilog code is notoriously fussy to get right. That said, if this gets checked in in the current state, I'll open an issue against the JIT team to look at coming up with the more optimal fix. I've been able to get this to reproduce reliably by running the determinism test in a loop under jitstress1 mode, so verifying a more complex fix is not a difficult task.

The other nice thing about subsets is that it is simple enough to figure out all the available subsets as they are right there for you as part of the help of the build.cmd/sh command. Why do we prefer two different mechanisms to filter out projects? (Subsets and properties like RefOnly)

I think one of the main goals we should have with these kinds of changes, is to try to minimize the impact as much as possible to developers existing workflows and by removing subsets (which are likely being used by a lot of devs) we are very likely breaking their workflow.

"Confirming my understanding:

When the editor has encountered what it and the language consider to be a ""potential commit character"", it lets us know that we should try to commit it.

There are two main exception cases where we do not commit, both of which are due to the chosen completion item having special, non-standard rules about filtering/committing.
1. The chosen item has explicitly declared that the typed character is to be used for _filtering_. That is, the character enters the buffer but the original completion session keeps running.
2. The chosen item has explicitly declared that the typed character is *not* to be used for committing. 

We check the above exception cases in order, so exception 2 actually means that the original completion session should be immediately halted. Then, the problem was that when halted after a `.`, that `.` was then not being considered as a trigger character for the next session because we were halting the wrong way.

---

So more to this PR, if `CommitBehavior.Cancel` is returned, that's our way of communicating that we actually know something the editor doesn't, and the completion session should continue on (the case of additional filter characters).

Then, every `CommitBehavior` _except_ `Cancel` means we are, in fact, ""doing"" the commit. There are three ways to mark it as such, one of which is `CommitBehavior.None`, and the other two non-`Cancel` commit behaviors that just tell the editor whether to handle TypeChar/Tab/Return non-standardly. In all 3 of these cases, the session is completed **and a new session is free to start if a trigger character had been typed**. This is why changing `Cancel` to `None` has the desired effect

What is the point to seal it? This actually removes it from the list of valid override candidates in completion list. Making it very easy to miss to override the API properly. It is fine to provide default implementation in this type, but I think we shouldn't be sealing any of them simply because it sends the wrong message and likely to lead to an oversight when derived types are implemented.

Alas, that means it's case sensitive. Hopefully that won't break anything.

I need to be able to convert C# `long` into JS `number` as part of the new marshaling.

Beyond that range, it should round to next possible integer, and not go crazy by setting exponent bits.

My naïve implementation uses BigInt to do the conversion, but it allocates object. 
So I want to improve and use math+shifts instead.

Your `CUInt64` is also expensive by allocating array.  
I wonder if we could use 'Number' and it's 64 bits to store the bits and only do some math when we need full sized BigInt.
But that would be different math than in my use case, because we would store different bits.

That's OK. Soon I will need them too.

"> What do you think of expanding this message to explain why routing should be first? I think it is useful to teach the dev about what is going on at each step. On the other hand the message is quite long already.

I really don't personally think we can use exception messages to teach people things, other than that the current thing is wrong. If you have a suggestion of how to reword this or some specific language you want me to add, I'd be happy to try anyway.

"I agree we use default values.  However, we also get bugs because of it :)

The default value does nothing (IMO) here but open up the possibility of someone passing in the wrong value.  By being required, that possibility is avoided entirely.  To me, that seems valuable.  Why even introduce that possibility?

I mean, i'm leaning at this point to just removing both errorcodes and just having a generic: ""Block bodies and expression bodies cannot both be provided.""  I don't think there's much value in having specific error codes for these different symbols kinds."
"So I've hit an interesting wrinkle with this that either proves you right @github (and my understanding wrong) or represents a mismatch between what the routing system considers the most specific metadata (the last one of a given type in the list), and what our projection into `ApiExplorer` considers the most specific metadata (the first one of a given type in the list)."

"> it feels like it should be a pretty trivial function to write...

That's what I thought on Friday. I got it wrong.

Much of the complexity of mine is coming from the fact that we don't always have all the transitive map is often incomplete: prior to my change, we compute that project-at-a-time. In your pseudocode, you would need additional checking that transitiveReferences might not have that entry, and if so then you have to preserve that. I could alternately choose to investigate that further, but at this point I feel we're entering bikeshedding territory.

Your code is also missing one important point: you're only propagating the new direct references. If A -> B and C -> D, and I'm adding B -> C, then you need to get D added too. My first loop computes you need to include D, also accounting for the fact we might not know C's transitive references and thus instead need to propagate ""we don't know""."

1. The original diagnostic was still reported in the same place, with a code fix offered

"Here's a test case which checks what happens if you ""terminate"" an OSC with a new CSI sequence:

    printf ""\e]11;rgb:FF/00/00\e[44mBlue\e[m\n""

My understanding is that the OSC hasn't received a valid string terminator so it should just be aborted, and the CSI starts a new sequence which should be executed. So I would except this to not alter the color table, but to write out the word ""Blue"" with a blue background (which is what XTerm does). Our current implementation executes the OSC, changing the default background color table entry to red, and then fails to execute the CSI, so it writes out ""44mBlue"" with the default color. I'm pretty sure that's wrong.

In short: This is a change, but I believe it's a bug fix, and we'd be matching XTerm (or so I assume - I haven't actually tested your branch)."

From what I've seen, it's more that very few clients actually request deflate because there historically was such confusion about what it meant.  But, yes, it's possible someone somewhere would break.

As for the initial post, this was my goal:
- collapse the auto implemented properties
