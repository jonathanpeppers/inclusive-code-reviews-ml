@github I had spent some time and implemented HW intrinstics for Min/Max and as asmdiffs shows more regressions I assume I did it wrong. I also couldn't figured it how to force the containment, I've always gotten something like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18483133/168826648-56318a63-73fd-4b23-bc8c-c7fcc264ea35.png)
if I understand the role of ""containment"" right then vmovss must go away.

Alternatively, I tried to investigagate the lowering way and change **ContainCheckIntrinsic** method, but ended up with the IsContainableMemoryOp check is never true for Math.Min/Math.Max. The only option I had was marking both op's with SetRegOptional which doesn't seem right.

I would be so happy if you pushed me to the right direction :) 

This PR was created due https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/65700 had been closed.

This test failed when I was running locally. Using `Browser.Exists` gets us the build logs which this one does not. In my case it was because something about the build had gone wrong and it failed to download a bunch of files which is the next mystery to solve.
"Nit: Please use predefined type names (like `int/string/object`, instead of framework type names (like `Int32/String/Object`). You might have the option set wrong at Tools\Options\Text Editor\C#\Code style\General.

"Good question. It's the same behavior as `GetForEachStatementInfo`, but does seem wrong.
For comparison, `GetAwaitExpressionInfo` returns `default` in such cases. I'll change foreach and deconstruction methods to do the same.

"Accessing `t_currentProcessorId` gets noticeably more expensive in `SimpleCoreIdSpeedCheck` if it is in the same class. It looks like JIT takes slow path while class is still not done with static initialization.

I could be wrong because I haven't looked at this close enough.   The thing to look for here which classes are sharing ownership?  Those are the classes that need to have shared_ptrs.   If the class doesn't share ownership then they should be raw pointer or references.  Hope this makes sense. "

"My preferred API surface when smart wrappers is involved -- and this extends to WRL::ComPtr and all similar variants -- is this:

```
smart_wrapper_thing GetAThing(); // produce shared wrapper
thing GetAThing(); // produce dumb thing, see note 1
void TakeAThingOptional(thing*); // consume only -- non-owning and non-shared -- optional
void TakeAThing(thing&); // consume only -- non-owning and non-shared -- required
```

_Of course, ref vs pointer is a decision you can make for the specific type. `HKEY` is by nature optional._

Putting the `smart_wrapper` into the consuming contract forces the caller to have that type (bad) and implies some ownership semantics (dependent on the type).

(1) In general, a function that returns a smart wrapper is subject to the same restrictions as one that returns the thing directly (like `HKEY openWslRegKey`): it must ensure that if an exception is encountered before the smart wrapper is populated, it does not leak the resource. Registry functions don't _throw_, so the need for returning a smart wrapper is reduced. That makes `HKEY open...` _okay_ in my book so long as we make sure to cover the error conditions."

"On a second thought, I think these tests that use `ExpectEvent(watcher, 0, ...)` are wrong and instead should use `ExpectNoEvent`."
"Sorry, this looks to have tagged the wrong line.

I meant `AreUpper32BitsZero` defaulting to `true` for any instruction with a ""supported format"" which deals with a 4-byte size: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/55129/files/f058b59c7eea2d743d728dc080613e8b6c710e61#diff-6b4e0f32449f2f144e05699f59f74415a564693637f643084a896dfbd081830dR313
```cpp
// Else rely on operation size.
return (id->idOpSize() == EA_4BYTE);
```

This is basically assuming that any instruction that has a 4BYTE op size zeroes the upper bits and this isn't strictly true for every instruction. I expect its mostly correct due to most machines having the VEX encoding and due to most GPR instructions on 64-bit zeroing the upper bits for the 32-bit version, but it would also be nice if we had this explicitly codified (such as via an instruction flag)."
"Ah, I see, I missed that Tom's PR updated this project from just targeting NetCoreAppCurrent to special-casing it for Windows, Unix, and Browser.

I checked with @github.  The RID graph has all those other platforms as derivatives of Unix, so the Unix target is covering them:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/OSGroups.json
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/57bfe474518ab5b7cfe6bf7424a79ce3af9d6657/eng/targetframeworksuffix.props
We probably need to either say that these do work on those platforms (but to my knowledge signal APIs don't... I could be wrong), fix the build to special-case each of those platforms, or do so by moving this into corelib as you suggested.  The already merged PR introduced this, so I won't tackle it here; we can do it subsequently."

"@github It ""looks wrong"" because it is peeking at characters offset from the `at` position.
Think of `_lineBufferOffset` as where we are in the source text. 
If you examine the internal of it's overload.

```
 For i = skip To (size - 1)
     If Peek(at + i) <> chars(i - skip) Then Return False
 Next
```

chars:=""HELP""

```
source  chars{ ]
(at+1)   +0
(at+2)   +1
(at+3)   +2
(at+4)   +3
```

The overload handles most of the cases where `skip` isn't 1. Some I didn't bother with as I thought that the existing code would be better.

"To be clear code bringing down the process is not my area of concern.  Code is always free to bring down the process and there is literally nothing we can do to prevent it.  Analyzer could decide for example to call `Environment.FailFast` and we are powerless to stop it.  This is understood and expected.  

What I am concerned about is whether the compiler needs to be hardened against exceptions that originate from the analyzer layer.  The compiler is not hardened against that and there is no intent to do so.  This change though is making it so the compiler needs to understand exceptions can happen and react appropriately.  That is wrong.

"Personally, I would have left these as magic numbers of ""what's the right answer?"" vs ""well, the const was wrong, so it produced the wrong sized output... but it did so faithfully!""; but I don't feel strongly.

It's a slight bit weird that for HMACMD5 you used the MD5 (non-HMAC) const, but for the SHA ones you used the HMACSHA* ones.

But, again, it merely falls in the ""worth commenting on"" zone that's not quite at ""I have a real opinion here""."

What was wrong w/ using `DataProtectionCommonExtensions` explicitly❔ Seems you're making the opposite change in src/DataProtection/Extensions/test/DataProtectionAdvancedExtensionsTests.cs

":memo: This is based on the idea that #17393 is one of the following:

"here's one idea: 

the part that gets confusing here is htat we're in instance methods computing new data, which we'll then use to create a totally new instance.   There's nothing per-se wrong with this.  But there's always this nagging concern in my head of: OMG, is he going to accidently mutate state of hte object.

I realize that's a somewhat silly concern as all the fields are readonly and Immutable objects.  But at teh same time, it still makes it a bit hard to reason about.

So a little suggestion i might have would be to call into some sort of static helper that computes all the new fields, and then construct the new value out of that.  Or, alternatively, have N static helpers that do nothing but interrogate the old data and return the new data for that particular field.  The top level algorithm is just:

```c#
var newXField = ComputeIncrementalUpdateToX(this.xField, args...)
var newYField = ComputeIncrementalUpdateToY(this.yField, args...)
...
return new Graph(new...);
```

This would also have hte added benefit of having each part of hte algorithm independent and easier to review.  Right now it's super hard to check to ensrue that you're not accidently using the wrong local vs. field in many of these sibling loops.

What do you think?"

"> ""Cannot"" isn't strictly true. Of course it can. But that would end up being three lookups per symbol, rather than three per compilation. Do you prefer an extension method here all the same?

I would.  Three lookups seems like nothing... especially since Compilations cache these calls to GetTypeByMetadataName.  Now, if we had perf data indicating a cost here, i would feel differently.

*That said*: i'm not opposed to this PR in this form.

"> Forgetting CheckValidInstance is just wrong.  It means that InvalidOperationException wouldn't be thrown on a `default` value, which they should add a test for.  If they fail to add it, they'll get a NullReferenceException, and then the fix is to call CheckValidInstance and have the exception be thrown.

Sure. The point with annotating it with nullability is that the contributor will catch the issue at build time rather than at test/run time. They may not add a test (and requires PR reviewers to point it out).

> Describing the field as non-null seems to match what I want the caller code to look like (call CheckValidInstance and then know that you're happy), without caring how the nullability feature is implemented.

You can create a new class that only contains the info captured in `startColumn` and `endColumn`.

"Questions that came up today

- Jupyter can update outputs from a background Thread, after the cell has finished ""running"". To update outputs without a WorkspaceEdit they can create a dummy Task for that cell, we had discussed this possibility earlier, but it results in blinking the run state and execution order, so I can try to delay/debounce that or we can just live with it 
- The output methods on the Task are not correct for modifying outputs on other cells, need to be able to pass in an index
  - Jupyter only needs replaceOutputItems for modifying outputs on other cells, but do we want the full set of methods for setting outputs and output items on the Task's cell and other cells? This would be 8 in total.
- What is the right way to guarantee that edits will be applied? I added a method that applies edits without checking the model version, but this is wrong, because edits use an index that could be invalid. I think we just have to loop retrying to apply these from the EH. If edits used a URI instead of a cell index maybe it would work to just force apply the edit."
"The FD standard specifies `file://localhost/some/path` or `file:///some/path` but allows `file://some/path` for bug-compatiblity, if I recall the research from the other OSC 7 PR. I think `file://myhost/some/path` was messy, because if I recall correctly, the FD spec would be looking for `/myhost/some/path` on the local system (`file://` can only refer to local system file paths in the FD spec, so this falls into the back-compat processing) while on Windows, `file://myhost/some/path` means `\\myhost\some\path`, i.e. a UNC path using the hostname as the hostname.

Windows is happy with `file://localhost/C:/games` and `file:///C:/games` and takes them both as 'local' when asked via ""Run"".

So `file://WIN-DESKTOP-1/D:` would be very likely to be invalid, as I don't think a CIFS share can have `:` in its name. (I could be wrong. Either way, it's certainly not what the user intended).

I think my suggestion at the time was to receive a URL, and if the hostname was the local system name, replace it with `localhost` before letting any Windows APIs see it.

It all gets super-messy with WSL though, as `file://wsl$/Ubuntu/home/users` is the correct file URL for `/home/users` in the Ubuntu WSL instance, but there was definitely _strong_ objection to using `file:$(wslpath -m ${PWD})` to generate this, in favour of some magic at another level so that the WSL environment could ignore that it was in WSL when generating OSC 7."

"The more I read the Teams thread and the documentation for `AssemblyLoadContext` the more I think we should just go with the allow list approach here. Imagine if we built the allow list and then integrated it into `AnalyzerAssemblyLoader.ShouldLoad`. That makes the logic here a lot more simple, it's a simple `ShouldLoad` check to determine whose responsibility it is to load. 

The other reason comes down to the invariants around `AssemblyLoadContext`. Specifically [this one](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dependency-loading/understanding-assemblyloadcontext): 

> Be repeatable. A query for a specific dependency must always result in the same response. The same loaded dependency instance must be returned. This requirement is fundamental for cache consistency. For managed assemblies in particular, we're creating an Assembly cache. The cache key is a simple assembly name, AssemblyName.Name.

The current implementation is not going to meet that because it's using the runtime state of the default `AssemblyLoadContext` to determine the load behavior in the child one. As the runtime state evolves the answers in the child `AssemblyLoadContext` will change. Hence we violate this invariant. 

Sorry to go back and forth on this one. It wasn't until this morning where I was re-reading the thread, doing some experiments and re-reading the docs that I saw this invariant and realized we may be on the wrong path here."
"Can't quite tell, but it appears SendUnableToUpdateRuleSetNotification is going to pop a dialog, which means we need to have done TakeOwnership() on the original UIThreadOperationContext or we might end up with dialogs improperly stacked. This may have worked fine before since I think (the diff is crazy to read) that we were only showing a threaded wait dialog in the one branch, as opposed to starting it right away."
"I see what you mean, and understand your concerns 👌 Following the same logical argument as earlier, I think it is correct not to log _Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down._, since the application did not transit from starting to started state. I definitely think this can be made clearer by adding logging, as you suggest.

A few thoughts on your cache example:

1. I don't think it is unreasonable to ask the developer to check the state of the host (using `IHostApplicationLifetime`) here. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it is the one source of truth for the host's state. I understand that what I'm suggesting is a changed behavior. It would be interesting to know how common of a scenario it is to have code like that in combination with a call to `StopApplication` made in a hosted service. 
2. If we would throw on `_applicationLifetime.ApplicationStopping` instead of returning, the behavior changes from how it works today, as it is currently possible that all hosted services starts even though the application is instructed to stop.
3. A wild idea, that probably is not feasible:  It is possible to decorate the host's `IServiceProvider` so that if services are resolved from a not fully started host, it logs a warning before resolving the service, or perhaps it should not be possible to resolve services if the start is interrupted? This is probably overkill, and the logging from the incomplete start would probably suffice - just widening the solution space 😆 "

Sorry I merged something wrong and so GitHub automatically added you as a reviewer.
"I would ask for your apologies for the rant you’re about to read, but after 6 years and all the patience I can muster, I believe I’ve earned it.

The original issue and PR for this bug is about to celebrate it’s SEVENTH BIRTHDAY. Over that time Skye and I have expended **so much energy** trying to get this over the finish line. It is incredibly disappointing that there are so many at Microsoft *continuing* to get in the way of getting this done.

.NET Core was sold to us developers as a way to break from the past, and major releases were going to be places where breaking changes could be made. Yet for 6 years I’ve continued to hear excuse after excuse. To quote Yoda, “always with you it cannot be done.”

Had this been fixed with .NET Core 2 when I submitted the first PR, MAUI and the other platforms would have dealt with it when they were being built, and WPF would have been fixed when it was being migrated. But it was punted to .NET Core 3.

Then, after the PR was already accepted and integrated, I was told WPF was already late and had too many bugs to be able to get the work done in time for the .NET Core 3 release. Our work was held up because the WPF team over-promised and couldn’t get its act together. Victory was ripped away from us at the last possible second.

In the time since, instead of guiding people building new frameworks like MAUI towards making decisions that would allow this work to get done more easily, Microsoft finds time to invest in things like “Minimal APIs” that only marginally impact developers.

So you’ll have to forgive me if, after missing it in .NET Core 2, 3, 5, 6, AND 7, that maybe I don’t believe we’ll see it in .NET 8.

It’s cool though. Maybe we’ll see this get fixed by the time .NET 12 rolls around. In the meantime, I’ll just continue to wonder how anyone EVER let WPF get past a code review with exceptions being thrown in event handlers, and why it seems like the same people are being allowed to hold back amazing frameworks like Blazor from taking advantage of these features.

@github thank you so much for your efforts. I can only imagine the emotional toll that having your status as “.NET contributor” ripped away year after year after effing year has had on you. It sucks having so many people stand in the way of something so obviously broken."

Possible fix John added to that PR - [`29a835f` (#25587)](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/25587/commits/29a835f7a41ddccae69ad3e26f2b0f95c4053a8c)

Could this issue be the cause instead?"
"Anyone who wants to know ""what are these spans valid against"".  Right now we just say things like ""there is an error in document 'Foo.cs' at span 1-5"".  But that is lossy data.  Clients who get this data can't properly know if that span is accurate.  For example, if someone wanted to navigate there, it could put the caret in the wrong place.  

--

I would turn it around.  Right now we lose data, assuming that no one wants it.  But i think that's wrong.  I think people care greatly about the spans for diagnostics, especially knowing where they actually are.

Roslyn has been built hugely on hte non-lossy snapshot model of the world.  We don't have any other APIs that say things like ""here's data associated with some non-snapshot concept"".  i.e. we don't say ""here's the tree for this filename"" or ""here's the semantic model for this document id"".  We always associate data with a real snapshot so we know it is accurate, and also so we can appropriately map between snapshots in a cohesive manner."

"> I think the type should be inferred from the property itself down when generating a named constant but not the other way around. I just don't see how that's useful.

I have given two concrete examples of how i think it would be useful to some subsets of our customer base.  That is sufficient to me.  I see no reason to think that that pattern matching will not *commonly* be used for this case.  i.e. someone simply wants to deconstruct, and they just like explicit types.  As such, they will do ```X: type x, Y: type y, ...``` as the *norm* for how they deconstruct.  Inferring thusly what the types of X and Y are seems very sensible to me. 

In the case where we're wrong, the user fixes up the type.  That's the same with the type-inferred *already* today.  THis is 100% a heuristic-based approach to *guess* at what we think is the most reasonable thing to infer.  It's often wrong because the user intends something different.  That's ok."

The problem is really with the base type, so why not make the location more specific to that?
- In case of a partial class, the current location might not even be at the same declaration. I don't think it's a good experience to show a squiggle for a problem that's in a completely different location.
- Other errors that have to do with invalid bases already report a location of the base itself, see below for `ERR_StaticDerivedFromNonObject`, `ERR_DuplicateInterfaceInBaseList` etc.

Yea you're not wrong. I thought I could solve it quick without reading 🤦‍♂️ 

As a team, we thought maybe the best way to go about this would be to do just the tab switching solution for the timeframe of 1.6, and come back to this discussion for 1.7. @github You still cool spinning up that fix?"
I agree. But the original spacing was _wrong_ spaces instead of tabs.

"> _If this was not explicitly discussed during the API review_

We did mention that Windows differentiates between a symlink to a file and a symlink to a directory, hence why we needed to have separate creation APIs for directories and for files.

> _having this check and subsequent throw requires processing in user code (try-catch)_

We want to throw an exception because we think it's safer to tell the user early that they are using the wrong API for creating a symlink to the desired target.

> _it can be argued that a link is almost always created in a situation where the target is well known. I can't even think of a scenario where someone creates a link without knowing anything about the target._

I would consider this an argument in favor of throwing to let the user know they are creating a symlink using the wrong API, especially since they know the file was either a file or a directory.

Here are a couple of examples of the `mklink` command with the wrong target.

"@github: I checked. The manifest is all good. The DAC signature in the packages that flow to upstream (zips, runtime packs, transport packs). The only place where it is unsigned it's in the CrossOSDiag package and its symbol package. Those used to be signed in the `prepare-artifacts` signing pass as they are a specially crafted package - it has assets built in several legs.

- One big question I had: In the post build plan, will symbols only be indexed after they've been signed at the top of staging?
  - If so, all intermediate repositories will have to fetch symbols manually for their failures. The use of cross OS diagnostics will also not work - all dumps will have to be debugged directly in that platform and downloading the DAC will be a manual process. darc could probably help here. This just warrants long documentation as current investigation of dumps will be heavily degraded.
  - If not, then we have issues signing here. Unless you can somehow - which I thought wasn't possible, but maybe I'm just wrong - we will need the cross OS artifacts to be signed before indexing at a minimum. And then we get to the same discussion as earlier of a public symbol server with unsigned assets. One thing we could do is use an interim symbol server that's not MSDL + SymWeb (either sleet - though we've had perf bottlenecks there - or AzDO artifact services)."
"@github 

> I was under the impression that the C# team was still promoting == null and != null as the preferred equality checking mechanism and that is null and is not null were more of a secondary thing

Think I'm not quite getting my point across. The C# team doesn't have any type of official position here (at least not that I'm aware of). Hence this isn't about conforming to some guidelines. Different teams make different choices about this. I personally love `is null` & `is object` but that's just me :smile:

My comments are mostly in response to this 

> If we had a fixer that targeted types that has user defined equality operators, it could potentially result in a much smaller PR

My read here is that you preferred the use of `is null` and variants applied only to types that have equality operators. If that interpretation is wrong I apologize. 

I feel like that approach though misses the point of embracing `is null`. That style is all about developers writing code that unambiguously operates as they intend around checking for `null` or the absence of it. The intent is to make it as simple as straight forward as possible. There is no need to go searching around for equality operators because `is null` has only one interpretation. If the only use is reserved for cases where equality operators exist then it really defeats the purpose of the change. 

> @github's recommendation seems viable. 

Indeed. If the runtime team wants to embrace `is null` as a style then that is a very reasonable way to approach it.

"I would use **20145.1000** from these reasons:
- It encompasses Server builds we know support Schannel for QUIC.

- If it was wrong for client Insider builds, we would have heard about it by now I hope.
- Even if it was wrong and nobody told us, it is unlikely anyone will be using ancient client Insider builds (which are even not officially supported), so all we need to make sure is that recent client Insider builds are higher version than the one we check for ... which they are."

It has all the required stuff and capable of building runtime. Something else in AzDo is apparently going wrong. Nothing jumping out at me from logs of `Initialize containers` step, all looks normal until `Build CoreCLR Runtime` step, which seems to be using a different environment."
I think we can catch it if we turn on `runtimeTargets` for .NETFramework.  That will give us coverage for the runtime-specific scenario.  We might want to ignore any `runtimeTargets` that don't start with `win` (since we don't really care if someone who builds a .NETFramework project for RID = linux gets wrong asset).

The condition for the debugger tests was wrong so it is not running on Rolling.

Change the condition to install the windows certs to be based on platform rather than name suffix, that way it makes it more resilient for future additions and to be able to share the same template reference for windows and non windows if needed to add this platform to an existing template reference scenario.

In several cases, NullabilityInfoContext would return values which were
out of sync with the C# compiler's interpretation of the nullability
metadata. This fixes the following cases:
* The `NullablePublicOnly` attribute was not considered when analyzing
private constructor parameters.
* CodeAnalysis attributes on indexer properties were not recognized.
* CodeAnalysis attributes were not recognized in a `#nullable disabled`
context.
* Private value-typed members lacking nullable annotations were not
properly marked as nullable/notnull.
* Mixing CodeAnalysis attributes with opposite meanings (e. g.
`AllowNull` and `DisallowNull` produced the wrong result.
* Analysis of members inherited from generic base types did not
incorporate the nullable metadata associated with the inheritance.

Backport of #63814 to release/6.0

/cc @github

A 6.0 PR introduced a regression in the profiling APIs, where the ObjectsAllocatedByClass API was triggered by the wrong profiler keyword.

## Customer Impact
As it stands in 6.0 profilers cannot enable ObjectsAllocatedByClass without enabling object allocation callbacks, which is extremely expensive, perturbs the process, and is impossible to do on attach.

## Testing
Manual and automated tests

## Risk
Low, the fix is targeted to just the ObjectsAllocatedByClass API.

Fixes #68042

This is unfinished, but I'm leaving for vacation, so I wanted to share the current state of this effort.

## Problems with previous code
The previous conversion code is buggy. 
* It relies on false assumptions 
  * ""Round the input to a 15-digit integer. The R8 format has only 15 digits of precision, and we want to keep garbage digits out of the Decimal were making.""  This is an incorrect assumption, and the cause of the linked bug.
* It seems to have solved an off-by-one error in a hacky way 
  * `const uint DBLBIAS = 1022;` is conceptually incorrect; the exponent bias for `double` is `1023`
* It generally doesn't take advantage of a lot of functionality we now expose in `double` and `decimal`

## Summary of approach
This PR is a general refactor of the conversion code. The primary goal is to solve the reported bug, but secondarily make this process more efficient by reusing fast code we have written elsewhere. To achieve this, @github and I brainstormed reusing a section of the Dragon4 algorithm for `double` to `string` conversion, as printing a `double` already involves converting it to base 10.

To do this, I split up the code for the Dragon4 algorithm into two parts and added an additional API that allows `Decimal.DecCalc.cs` access to the first half of Dragon4. This API is structured to return everything `Decimal.DecCalc.cs` needs to construct a `decimal` representation of the original `double`.

## Status of the work
The rough draft of the approach is complete, and the original bug reported in #68042 is now fixed. Unfortunately, the logic does not seem to be holding up for all code paths, as there are a number of failing test cases in `DecimalTests.cs`. For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18474647/173167981-811fca87-1009-4a2f-afdf-bc2b5f0e2fa8.png)

I haven't had enough time to dive deep into what is causing these issues, but I'm adding GitHub comments to the logic that I think is shaky.

## What is left to do

* Fix the logic to handle all the failing edge cases
* Ensure we have proper test coverage
* (Possibly) perf analysis to see if borrowing from Dragon4 is giving the performance we are expecting
* If we determine this Dragon4 method is barking up the wrong tree, use another method @github and I have brainstormed. In my opinion, correctness and maintainability is more important than performance here. 
* Backport to previous versions of .NET?

The suppression on `System.Attribute` is wrong. Ran into this in #70201 where `EditorBrowsableAttributeTests.EqualsTest` is failing because we didn't generate any reflection metadata for the field. This proves beyond any doubt that even I can't write a correct trim warning suppression.

There's a difference between ""a field is kept"" and ""a field is accessible from reflection without issues"". The issue is more pronounced in Native AOT (where the field can be completely erased from reflection). The implementation of `Attribute.Equals` didn't see any fields on the attribute type because the static analysis didn't deem any of them necessary.

Fields (or methods) that are provably not visible from reflection without warnings are free to be optimized in any way by trimming (e.g. how we strip method parameter names in illink).

This fixes the suppression and replaces it with a more correct DAM on type.

"Regardless of which pattern we use, this code just seems wrong.  You're not always disposing the disposable.  That very much goes against how disposables are almost always used.  i.e. the way people normally intend disposables to be used is such that they're always disposed. i.e. in synchronous code we don't do:


```c#
var disposable = ...
code...
disposable.Dispose();
```

Because an exception/early-return wil prevent disposing.  Instead we either use a try/finally, or just a using-block.

This is one of the benefit of just using the built in language constructs.  this sort of mistake would have been immediately noticeable.  Someone would have seen the naked 'dispose' and said 'that should go in some sort of try/finally'.  When you hand roll your own deconstruction of async/await, it's very easy to get it wrong and to not actually provide the semantics that are wanted.

In this case, regardless of hte choice about aysnc/await or ContinueWith, we still need to likely ensure that we actually dispose our disposables."

"> is there any risk of user code throwing an exception here and us not bubbling it up? 

Yes, it happens in the tests on CI. It's what I'm describing above. The connection `Dispose` propagation might be faster than the completion of `sendRequestContentTask`. Effectively bubbling up `HttpRequestException` instead of the one thrown by the content.

As I said, very similar thing happens in HTTP/2. There wasn't and isn't any hang problem, but sometimes the exception from abort is faster than completion of request sending task and we bubble up the ""wrong"" exception. This already exists, I just caught it with my new test.

If we do want to bubble up the right exception (the one from request content sending), I'd need change the HTTP/2 flow as well."
"@github In my day job, we don't add {} for classes/objects.  
Our rule has more detail with proper ""c++ legalese""  but it is basicallly
Use {} for all POD,  structs.  (i.e. - any object that doesn't get initialized at declaration)
For enums and enum class we require that you provide a default enum value.  (enums with {} have the potential to be completely wrong)

Since structs can be default initialized correctly with member initializing you could argue that they don't need to use {}.   But again to keep this simple we require the use of {} because most structs do not member initialize their variables.

Not sure if this is right, but seeing objects that have ctors that have {} seems wrong to us.

@github Says:

> Hey Joao! I was following your work on https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/compare/joao/snap , isn't the core problem related to the incorrect path to gdk-pixbuf-2.0 on these platforms ? for 64 bit we always default to x86_64-linux-gnu https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/resources/linux/snap/electron-launch#L8 but the library is under /usr/lib/. Am i understanding the problem incorrectly ?

The actual problem is that Code should always use the gdk-pixbuf inside the snap. But by removing the env very early on (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/7d62a5b857e41d43e62bb6a17aa2fe6bd58019df) we hit the situation in which the About dialog reads the wrong env later on and looks up a path which doesn't exist in the snap, so ends up falling back to the OS. In Ubuntu this isn't a problem, but in other Linuxes the path doesn't exist.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/7d62a5b857e41d43e62bb6a17aa2fe6bd58019df must be reverted, but we still need to address spawning other processes (eg Firefox), that's what this PR does."

"Hmm. I'm a bit dumb. I did this PR so quickly that I forgot that the original solution in the issue is to use the DWM API to make the frame dark like explorer.exe.

Still, I don't know what solution is the best.

Recap according to what I know:

**Imitation of the system top border (this PR):**
- Done by Chromium and it looks like also Firefox and the thing that powers UWP apps (because they are affected by the same weird bugs, see below)
- Not perfect in this PR (see PR description)
- Must be updated if an OS update changes the behavior (like 1809 which removed accented borders when ""Title bars and window borders"" is disabled)
- No one seems to do it correctly when the accent color setting is disabled
  - Chrome (continues to paint the top border with the accent color even when the setting is disabled): ![Chrome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56923875/74543318-76a3b780-4f45-11ea-9fc6-d92b897ca197.png)
  - Firefox (no transparency, wrong color): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56923875/74544965-56c1c300-4f48-11ea-8d71-2c3166c9bd33.png)
  - UWP apps, the best imitation (have transparency ✔️ but the color isn't the exact same, really hard to notice): 
![UWP apps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56923875/74544728-ea46c400-4f47-11ea-8da7-973955451e94.png)
- BTW, weird bugs start happening once you starting switching between light/dark mode (I'm running 1903)
  - Settings app: ![UWP Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56923875/74543007-ee251700-4f44-11ea-888d-2de0bbc87ff3.png)
  - Firefox: ![Firefox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56923875/74543601-f03ba580-4f45-11ea-897e-f1f190af4b88.png)
- But you have to be looking really hard to notice any difference

**`DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea` + DWM API to force dark border (the original idea in the issue):**
- Solution used by explorer.exe (I think) when dark mode is enabled to not have a white border across the window like we have now
- Unofficial API = might break = must be updated if the API changes
- Probably wasn't made for that use case (of always enabling it to prevent the white border bug)"

"> Why's that? I actually thought a signed int was the right choice.

It's just... It kind of feels wrong to me at times. For instance your code does `std::min(r, 100)`, which is 100% exactly what I'd do myself. But shouldn't it be `std::clamp(r, 0, 100)`? Because if `r` was negative, the computation would result in a negative number and thus in a red value of `255` instead of `0`. We know it works, because `VTInt`s are never negative.
So I've been thinking whether it would make sense to make `VTInt` a `uint32_t` or maybe even a `uint16_t`. The former would contractually guarantee that negative numbers can't exist and the latter would even make it possible to freely convert it to both `uint32_t` or `int32_t` without any AuditCheck naggings. Hmm... 🤔
But it's not that important really...

> I've done some initial experiments with a LUT, and it's a big improvement for `ColorFromRGB100`, but in `ColorFromHLS` it actually seems somewhat slower.

Oh nice! I'm glad it works in practice! BTW here's a SO answer with a low-level HLS-RGB routine: https://stackoverflow.com/a/45450486
That post is [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) so we can easily use it here if we choose to do so. I think the last line is supposed to read `(r+m)<<16`, etc., which makes me question whether the code is correctly tested. But it does seem reasonable."

"I guess the `rsGetRsvdReg()` might be available, and you know that the instructions and addressing modes you're generating won't require it (in the emitter), but it kind of seems wrong, anyway. It seems like you should request another temp reg from LSRA and use that instead.

One reason why: ideally, we would be able to only allocate `rsGetRsvdReg()` if the size of the frame (and maximum local variable offset) required it. We haven't done that on arm64 because we have ""enough"" registers, so always reserving one didn't seem expensive.

this comment (and the next) are wrong
"This is a habit from C/C++, but it it's not a bad habit to have. Putting the constant on the left is called a ""Yoda conditional"" and in languages like C/C++ that don't present warnings on assignments in conditionals this prevents you from accidentally using `=` instead of `==`. It's not necessary in C#, but I think a lot of people will want to use the same style and since it isn't wrong to do so in C# I don't think we should go about changing it.

"Yeah, the socket limit should keep it sane as long as it's filtered by `sysctl`. It's anywhere we intend to walk the entirety that it becomes a very big problem and will need OS-specificity. `xinpcb` contains not only TCP and UDP but also SCTP and raw, so `kptr_t` becomes much more necessary.
I don't think we should change to a `long` here though; TCP/UDP is still defined as 65535 possible ports maximum. If we're seeing more than 65535, something else has probably gone wrong. ;)"
"`xinpcb` is correct. However as I mentioned above, on FreeBSD this might be incorrect and possibly problematic behavior as `xinpcb` _may_ be an `int64_t`. I think 'absolute correctness' here would be for `count` to be `sizeof(kptr_t)` and `kptr_t_alias count = (kptr_t)...` but I definitely could be wrong.
But `int32_t` isn't likely to break things, since this operates off `net.inet.udp.pcblist` and so should never exceed ~64511."
"This seems like a good approach assuming that the allocated byte count is reliable.

"> Could you please elaborate what exactly is wrong with copying the structure? 

We recently did a performance investigation which revealed a large number of allocations (10+GB) in calls to `MetadataTypeName.NamespaceSegments`. This is a lazily-computed value which is persisted to a mutable value type, so part of the investigation time involved determining if the code was operating on the ""original"" instance of this type or a copy (where the latter would fail to persist the lazily-computed value such that subsequent calls return the cached copy).

> What effect is this going to have?

An analyzer will report a warning if a copy of an instance of this type is made (as opposed to _moving_ the instance, which is safe). The attribute eliminates the need to perform the investigation described previously (in fact, the evaluation was actually performed by applying this attribute and seeing what happened).

Current usage of this type produced one true positive report from this analyzer, and zero false positives. The analyzer is good, but not perfect, so it is possible that some future use would report a false positive that needs to be suppressed or fixed."
"> However, this isn't necessarily the wrong choice. Crossgen2 does not use the IsSupported function call mechanism, but instead it performs speculative compilation assuming the processor intrinsic IS available which yields excellent performance for this case on Haswell and newer processors.

Do we have a rough percentage of CPUs that are Haswell or later that would justify whether or not this is actually worthwhile? If you go based off of the March 2020 Steam Hardware Survey: https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/

Then roughly 75% of reported CPUs support AVX2 (and would therefore have BMI1/BMI2/LZCNT, based on what Intel/AMD have shipped):
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10487869/80646078-f0b1eb80-8a20-11ea-8eed-568daf0f3d37.png)

This naturally doesn't take into account developer machines, server hardware, etc. But, if we are saying LZCNT is likely to be supported, then there is an equal number of AVX2/BMI1/BMI2 machines in the same boat and a greater number of AVX machines and we should likely consider what is a ""good baseline""."
">  Why are we trying to make LSP only depend on the features layer?

The main concern I have with this is that the editor layer needs an implementation for every editor (as I understand it, anyway). O# can't use it because of this today, and if we ever want Roslyn's LSP to be usable by things other than VS it will need to be independent of that layer. If my understanding of the layering concerns here is wrong, then do please let me know, as I could totally be wrong about my understanding of how our layering works."
"Yes, the JS would error at runtime. The JS decl emit differs because the original declaration of `A` isn't actually a class and a lot of our code in the checker for resolving base constructor types depends on it being a class, regardless of what the binder says. Its probably fine to have the decl emit be wrong here if we report an error when you subclass."
"If I understand this PR correctly, here's the current approach (please correct me if I'm wrong):

(1) Every time a RawValue is added, we also add the same value as an OriginalRawValue.
(2) On parse, we parse the RawValue and set the ParsedValues, then clear the RawValue (as today), but we leave the existing OriginalRawValue in place
(3) On add of a strongly-typed value to ParsedValues, we also add a new OriginalRawValue.

Question: What happens if a user modifies an existing ParsedValue? E.g. update a single-valued header, or remove an item from a multi-valued header. Seems like we are not handling this case.

Beyond that, I have two concerns with the current implementation:
(1) It increases the size of the header store by adding OriginalRawValues (as @github mentioned above)
(2) It adds overhead in the common case of setting strongly typed values, because we need to also store an OriginalRawValue whenever this happens (as I mentioned above)

I'd suggest the following changes:

First, I don't think we actually need OriginalRawValue. We can just keep RawValue around after parsing is done. We can know the RawValues have been parsed by the presence of Parsed and/or Invalid values and not re-parse the RawValues again once it's parsed.

Second, I think we can avoid the overhead of keeping the RawValue in sync with any changes the user makes to ParsedValue by simply clearing the RawValue if they make changes. We can then generate a new RawValue if/when they enumerate NonValidatedHeaders. This also fixes the update issue I mentioned above. 

In short, at a given time, a header is in one of these states:
(1) Just parsed values. E.g. user adds parsed values. We can generate a raw value from these when needed (we do this today anyway when enumerating).
(2) Just raw values. E.g. user adds raw values via TryAddWithoutValidation. If the user does something to cause parsing, then we parse and end up in state (3) below.
(3) Both parsed values and raw values. In this case, the parsed values and raw values are always guaranteed to be in sync. If the user modifies either, we discard the other and end up in state (1) or (2).

Thoughts?

Fixes: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/62218

## Customer Impact

When doing some refactoring on how we calculate assembly versions we accidentally removed a property that calculated the file version embedded into the assembly.  When an application is compiled as self-contained and bundled into an MSI file, upgrading from a previous (e.g. .NET 5) which can lead to this assembly missing on the installation location or the wrong assembly to be used.

## Testing

VIsual inspection of the assembly to make sure the file version is correct and higher than the ones in previous releases.

## Risk

Low, this is just changing the file version embedded into the assembly.

"> Why are we choosing to rewrite the key? Keys are entirely opaque to the framework - they may happen to look like .NET member accessors, but that doesn't mean we should arbitrarily transform them.

I think this is a reasonable argument for not adding this feature to System.Text.Json. However, based on the amount of feedback on the issue, this seems to be clearly the default behavior customers want from `ValidationProblemDetails.Errors` when using camelCased JSON properties.

The original issue mentioned nothing about the `DictionaryKeyPolicy`. To most people, the fact that the `ValidationProblemDetails.Errors` is a dictionary is merely an implementation detail. They just want the error keys to look like JSON member accessors. Later comments merely point out that a `DictionaryKeyPolicy` couldn't even be used to work around the current behavior.

I don't we should be using `DictionaryKeyPolicy` to gate this behavior especially if we're going to camelCase after every `.` meaning we're not really following any built-in `DictionaryKeyPolicy` to begin with. It would probably be better to continue to ignore the `DictionaryKeyPolicy` in here and gate this on the `PropertyNamingPolicy` instead. It might be *technically* wrong, but it behaves the way people want it to. That said, it would make this change more breaking.

```suggestion
#nullable enable
        public record RecordTypeOptions(string Color, int Length, string Foo);

When we set properties, we can just skip over the property if config doesn't provide a value, but calling a constructor that we can observe requires a non-nullable parameter with a null argument seems very wrong."
"Because I like seeing multiple kindModifiers in the rest of the baseline updates, I'd lean toward using a Set...except that we don't target ES6 yet, so you'll have to use `const modifiers = createMap<true>()` to mimic a set, then `arrayFrom(modifiers.keys())` to get the keys.

"@github If we're talking about _`ambient`_ context and decorators, I think we can avoid the new variables and use the original expression., because _`ambient`_ elements are skipped in JavaScript files. Maybe I'm wrong and we need to use a temp variable to store _computed property name for _`ambient`_ context  too 

Do you prefer to have the output for non-ambient names like this 

```ts
function dec(klass, name) {}
const isSymbol = Symbol('isSymbol');
class Foo {
}
__decorate([
    dec,
    __metadata(""design:type"", Number)
], Foo.prototype, isSymbol, void 0);
```

instead of 

```ts
var _a;
function dec(klass, name) {}
const isSymbol = Symbol('isSymbol');
class Foo {
}
_a = isSymbol;
__decorate([
    dec,
    __metadata(""design:type"", Number)
], Foo.prototype, _a, void 0);
```

Need to check this case, maybe there are cases in which a temporary variable is required to store a member name.
"
"```ts
class C1 {
    /**
     * @github {A}
     */
    value;
}

class C2 extends C1 {
    /**
     * @github {A & B}
     */
    value;
}
```

We set properties from `C2` to `seen`,
```ts
Map({ value /* A & B */ })
```

then we iterate over all the properties of the base types. In this case, we only have one property `[value / * A * /]`.

```ts
!isPropertyIdenticalTo(existing /* value: A & B*/, prop /* A */)
```
props are not identical, so we drop value from `seen`, as a result, `seen` is empty. 
```ts
arrayFrom(seen.values()); // []
```

I found that we can filter properties based on property `parent`

```ts
class C1 {
    /**
     * @github {A}
     */
    value;
}

class C2 extends C1 {
}
```

```ts
const seen = Map({ value /* A */ })
```

```ts
const baseProps = [value /* A */ ]
```

if props / * existing / prop * / refer to the same `parent`, it can be inherited in the child class, then we compare with the identity. Maybe it is a completely wrong way and needs to use another one. In this case, I'm really sorry that you wasted time reviewing this PR., I'll close the PR later.

So if the file is not edited, looks like there is some cached HTML tree that is returned and running this command more that 1 times would result in wrong HTML tree structure (a one that does not correspond to the text in the file).

So adding a 0 check to ensure that we don't add children to the script-node that has already been set up. Alternative approach is to clear the children array of script-node before setting up its subtree but that would again be not as performant as this check."

"To me, the second version scans better. The abbreviated version just looks like a bunch of typos at first glance. It's subjective.

Given that it's subjective, we should aim for consistency. General C#/.NET naming guidelines suggest using full words rather than abbreviations, and that's the guideline we follow in the rest of Xamarin.Forms [1]. Keeping the terms consistent throughout the API makes them more discoverable - if I type ""horizontal"" into a search or Intellisense, ""CenterHorizontal"" will show up while ""CenterH"" will not. 

If folks want to find the API to deal with columns, they should be able to trust that we call them ""column"" everywhere; not ""column"" in some places and ""col"" in others. 

[1] We've probably gotten at least one property name wrong somewhere, but it's _mostly_ consistent.

"Was looking at this and thinking that even one minute probably isn't enough here. Seen CI have hiccups where threads stalled for considerable amounts of time in the past. 

This lead me to think about how this problem is approached elsewhere in our code base. Specifically how is `SpinWaitComplete` handled when called outside a `ForceComplete` method chain where there is an explicit `CancellationToken` to use. Found the following examples:

- `AliasSymbol.GetTarget`
- `SourceMemberContainerSymbol.GetMembersByNameSlow`

In these cases we always pass `default` for the `CancellationToken`. I think that is the approach we should take here. This means that well written code will behave correctly, even under extreme CPU load. While the current approach could exhibit incorrect behavior under extreme load. 

The upside is that when this is done wrong, if we make the mistake you mention, the code will deadlock and deadlocks are very easy to debug. :smile:

"For this particular example nothing is gonna be wrong because we wouldn't even iterate backwards if we see ASCII at the end of the string. However, I understand your concern. The comparison should have been
`if (codePointLen > sequenceLen)`
If the lead byte indicates 2 bytes but we iterated already through 3 bytes then we got invalid UTF-8. In this case nothing is to be captured and the invalid sequence is to be converted into replacement characters."
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is only executed once during start right? In that case I wouldn't make this a singleton."
"There will be some hiccups when we migrate to Helix, complex system stuff will go wrong. I feel like it's invetible we'll hit a few periods where we want to flip away from Helix, go back to the old system while we work out the kinks and then flip back. 

Ideally there would just be a nice global variable we flip in the YML to achieve this. That though feels like it will make the scripts really awkward: double the queue information, lot more `if` in them to change how it works. Definitely would be hard to follow and a bit more up front work. 

At the same time the only other option for ""temporarily disable Helix"" is revert this change. This change is more than just flipping our infra to Helix, it's also changing how run tests work, changing how our scripts work, etc ... That could be done independently because they're all designed to work on Helix or without Helix. Wonder if we should do the following: 

1. Get this change to a point where we all agree and approve it. 
1. Do not commit this change 
1. Open two new PRs: one PR that contains everything but the YML changes and one that contains only the YML changes. Merge them in that order. 

Then if we do hit a bug where we need to temporarily disable Helix we would just be reverting the YML. That's probably more managable than all the other work that is coming along here.

"Hmmm. I thought we had something in the Numerics library that would just throw on fail here with a typed math exception instead of packing up the HRESULT in a generic wil_exception. @github am I crazy or does this exist?

"This is kinda/sorta done, actually, as `ReadVersion()` contains some logging.

The ""problem""/""concern"" is one of ""scope"" & expectations: since I saw `LogCodedError()` previously in this method, I *expected* a similar log here.  Perhaps my expectation is wrong.

Additionally, `ReadVersion()` has a code path which could throw an exception, which would result in XA5104 *not* being raised, which could be differently underirable."
"For my records here...

The weird crash I was experiencing in the middle `OpenConsole.exe` while testing off the handoffs from the operating system, especially from background tasks running out of things like Visual Studio, VS Code, and on login, were because there was TOO MUCH handoff occuring.

I had a torn state. My inbox console was doing the very aggressive handoff strategy, including in the case of connect of a second client. That's no bueno. The handoff happens just fine, but the `OpenConsole.exe` accepting the handoff doesn't have the process list table or other records of the already connected clients. Therefore when it eventually receives a disconnect message for them... it tries to look them up in its table and horks because it was the `conhost.exe` that accepted the initial connection, not the `OpenConsole.exe`.

I already solved this problem in https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/commit/1cf4fb180634333b24fb1cda2797e45c3d18490d by blocking handoff for attaches and for consoles that are already initialized the first time.

I'm putting my foot down that there's no half way state here right now. Either the inbox one, when it initially starts up, hands everything off and is done with the matter OR something goes wrong and the inbox one remains the console server for the remainder of that session. Otherwise there's this state and countless other state that would have to pass, and that's beyond the scope of what I'm trying to accomplish right now.

Also, technically, we probably should be having some opaque value stored in `CONSOLE_API_MSG.Descriptor.Process` instead of a `(ConsoleProcessHandle*)` so this would fail in a table-lookup sort of way not an access violation from a weird pointer dereference off of a foreign heap value. But I'm just going to put this over here...

"> The behaviour of 12 bit variants is to repeat the first digit at the end, e.g. rgb:123/456/789 becomes rgb:1231/4564/7897. This is done by caculating value / 0xfff * 0xffff.

I didn't see any unit tests for the 12 or 16-bit channel values, but I think this algorithm _description_ is wrong. For example, this turns `0x600` into `0x6005`, according to Windows' calculator.

The algorithm itself seems correct, it's the same thing `XcmsLRGB_RGB_ParseString` does to turn any number of digits into a 16-bit channel value. It's just the text that confused me.

That said, it looks like this never happens, because the colour parser ends up scaling _down_ to 8-bits-per-channel, rather than _up_ to 16-bits per channel.

I'm a bit suspicious of that scale-down algorithm too, as it appears to just be trimming the least-significant digits (it seems `scaleMultiplier` appearing in `scaleDivisor` cancels out?) For example, given `0x6fff`, it gets scaled down as `(0x6fff * 0x11 / (0x11 << 8))` => `0x6f`. I'd have expected `0x70` there. Scaling up those two possible values, again, we get 0x6f6f and 0x7070. That's a difference from the original of 0x90 and 0x71 respectively, suggesting that 0x70 was the more-correct value to scale down to.

That said, I'm basing this on rounding-to-nearest behaviour: if there's specific rules about scaling colour channel values down, I'm unaware of them. For example, I tried to invert the round-up rule above as `0x6fff * 0xff / 0xffff`, and that also comes out with `0x6f`. However, the same rule for `0x6f00` comes out with `0x6e`, while the algorithm in the code still gives `0x6f`. There's a good change this last thing was _not_ how one inverts that rule though, since in its native habitat, it only ever scales up."

I think this code is in the wrong place - you are likely walking more of the tree than you need. Wouldn't it be better to stop the walk at the very top of this function?
Having said that -- if we think doing this is not going to help those customers be successful (eg because we're not happy with the API) -- then I certainly am not arguing to do the wrong thing 😄  I think it would be better to sit on the problem until we feel confident we can do something useful.
"> Should it also have a general fallback at the bottom sort of like we give errorType when type checking?

It has a ""fallback"" already - emit the node as-is, which is used for _most_ typenodes. We only map away jsdoc-y typenodes here, cause printing them in not jsdoc is probably wrong. Namepath is even more special in that it doesn't even have emitter code, so actually just printed as an empty string."

Why would jit produce all that code for structs instead of a GC allocate call like with reference types? I might be wrong but it tries to get size from runtime handle first? Isn't it known at jit time?
"Personally, I don't have strong feelings between `GetEntryPointModuleHandle`, `GetMainProgramHandle`, and `GetMainProgramLibraryHandle`.  I'll even square the triangle with `GetEntryPointLibraryHandle`.

I do have weak feelings, which produce a preference order.

* GetEntryPointModuleHandle: The entrypoint is a unique thing.  You can have multiple methods named Main, but only one is the actual entrypoint.
* GetEntryPointLibraryHandle: While I think of .netmodules before I think of any Windows-specific use of ""Module"", I'm happy to say ""library"" instead of ""module"" here.  Maybe I'm wrong and this is my top choice.
* GetMainProgramLibraryHandle: In addition to Main being a non-unique target, lowercase ""main"" is subjective.  If you wrote a thin exe that hosts a big worker library, you may think of the worker library as the ""main"" aspect of your program.  It's probably not a likely mistake, but I like precision.
* GetMainProgramHandle: This could be a method handle, a function pointer handle, a library handle, a process handle, ... anything.  I don't like how vague it is.  Though, given that the type is `NativeLibrary`, maybe it's OK, and maybe it's better than the longer version.

Now that I'm done, I think GetEntryPointLibraryHandle is, in fact, my probably weak top choice (it's, at most, ""barely strong"").  But I don't want to rewrite my narrative bullet points."

<hr />

Currently, when process Handle can't be opened for any reason (local machine case), `ProcessManager.IsProcessRunning` enumerates all processes in the system to ensure that no process with given Id exists. This enumeration implemented via `EnumProcesses` call which is very slow (~10ms) compared to good case when process exists and handle is successfully opened

I want to suggest some improvements to (mostly) get rid of this fallback to achieve better performance.

Main suggestion is assume that process doesn't exists when `OpenProcess` failed not due to lack of permissions (`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`).

But there are some special cases should be considered.

Handle to process couldn't be opened:

- for Idle processes (`id=0`) (`ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER`)
- for protected (e.g. csrss.exe) processes (`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`)
- any other cases when our process is limited? maybe there is something special on Nano Server or old/future versions of Windows (who knows?)

In these cases we could (1 OR 2 OR 3):

1. fall back to slow enumeration (looks like the safest way, cases when enumeration does happen don't seem to be common)
2. optimistically assume that process is still running (allows to fully remove enumeration for local machine, but who knows if any other corner cases exists)
3. other suggestions?

`System.Diagnostics.ProcessManager.OpenProcess` still assumes `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` means still running process. So second way doesn't look completely wrong.

What do you think, which way should be used? In this PR, I've implemented the first way, but it's not a problem to rewrite with second way if these optimistic assumptions are reasonable.

"This logic looks wrong to me. What happens if `isWithinBaseUriSpace(absoluteUri)` is false, `force` is false, and `replace` is true?

What I'd expect is: since this is an external navigation, the force param is irrelevant, and the `replace` flag means we should be calling `location.replace`.

What the logic appears to do is call `history.replaceState`, which won't produce a useful behavior because it's only doing HTML5-style client-side navigation and won't trigger an actual external page load.

Here's the full truth table I'd expect:

| isWithinBaseUriSpace(absoluteUri) | Force | Replace | Expected behavior |
| ------------- |-------------| -----| ---| 
| false | false | false | `location.href = url` (append external page load to history) |
| false | false | true | `location.replace` (replace with external page load on history) |
| false | true | false | `location.href = url` (append external page load to history) |
| false | true | true | `location.replace` (replace with external page load on history) |
| true | false | false | `performInternalNavigation(absoluteUri, false, false)` (calls `history.pushState`) |
| true | false | true | `performInternalNavigation(absoluteUri, false, true)` (calls `history.replaceState`) |
| true | true | false | `location.href = url` (append external page load to history) |
| true | true | true | `location.replace` (replace with external page load on history) |

Do you agree with this list? Could you check how it corresponds to the implementation? I think the only combination that's currently wrong is the one I mentioned at the top of this comment.

I suspect that before this PR, the logic here was already wrong in that it didn't handle `replace` without also `force`. That was OK before because it wasn't really proper public API. But since this is becoming proper public API now, we should make sure all the combinations of parameters work correctly."
"I don't think there's any concern here. Nothing would go wrong unless we receives one of these messages before the first page connection, and that's impossible, because it's the page that sends them."
"They represent different checks:

- Imports.targets: This guards every build of our code base. It provides a polite failure when the wrong version of MSBuild is used.
- Powershell: Here we are discovering MSBuild instances on the machine and need to filter to 15.1 only. This covers items like running Build.cmd, CI machines, etc ... It helps us not hit the error that is issued in Imports.targets."
Do we understand if this does the right thing if the wrong version of the `ef` tool is installed?
"Hmm the strangeness comes from the fact that the version of S.IO.Pipelines that's in 6.0.0-alpha.1.20569.2 is versioned 6.0.0.0 for its assembly version, and that's what M.A.Components.Web references. However, the S.IO.Pipelines that's built into the aspnetcore shared framework is 5.0.0.0 and that's breaking crossgen since it can't find the 6.0.0.0 assembly. Something is wrong with the way we build our shared framework."

It was mostly that the middleware itself was more code than the rest of Http.Extensions. Like I don't think there are any middleware as part of the Http solution at all.

So it seems the tests fail when they're both ""active"". @github wondering if you have any context on the relation here?

When I was talking about switching to use the Publish target I didn't mean to switch to self-contained as well. I don't think that would apply here, right?

FWIW we will need to publish self-contained at least for code coverage in the future (talking about local inner-loop) as the current model is easy to break (we instrument referenced assemblies from the testhost directory and then undo the instrumentation when the coverage run is finished).

Unfortunately, due to the definition of where ASI occurs, determining whether ASI occurs while parsing is really easy, but determining whether a given semicolon in an already-parsed tree _would_ have been inserted by ASI were it not explicitly included (which is what this function tries to determine) is _extremely_ wishy washy. The definition is (paraphrasing a bit) “ASI occurs just about any time the parser can’t understand the next token without inserting a semicolon first.” Which means, to truly tell whether a semicolon was necessary, you have to try parsing without it, and see if you get the same result. That’s why this function appears so strange, and why the chances that this misses an opportunity to delete a semicolon is _much_ higher than the chance that `isSemicolonInsertionContext` is wrong—that one essentially just enumerates the places where `parser.ts` parses an optional semicolon."

"Hi, I'm the reporter of this issue - thanks for the swift fix! I was really curious why this has been happening (because seemingly it didn't really look that much different from other code that has been working) and I got into reading this PR to see how it got fixed.

I'm obviously just a bystander and I lack *a lot* of context but understanding this fix probably would allow me to understand the TS compiler better. I'm wondering if you would be able to share a little bit more in-depth explanation behind this? I will totally understand if you won't have time for that though.

I suspect that `SymbolFlags.TypeAlias` checks if this is a `type` type and not the `interface` - does it mean that one could use the `interface` for `LibraryManagedAttributes`? I kinda assumed that this is not possible but maybe I was wrong - I can't quite check this quickly myself because this has not been yet released to the nightly channel.

This change later checks the `typeParameters.length >= 2` - this looks quite odd for me because the given code uses exactly 2 type parameters, so why this is even relevant for this fix? I would more expect that this piece of code would provide exactly as many type parameters as the `managedSym` accepts (up to 2 as no more will be ever provided). Shouldn't also maybe `JSX.LibraryManagedAttributes` with more than 2 type parameters result in an error since those extras won't ever be provided? And how ""fillMissingTypeArguments"" is relevant here for the ""top most"" `managedSym`? Will this fix the other case that I've mentioned (albeit without repro because I've concluded that the underlying issue is probably the same):
```ts
type LibraryManagedAttributes<C, P> = WithConditionalCSSProp<
  ReactJSXLibraryManagedAttributes<C, P>
>
```
This snippet is using both type parameters so I would expect that nothing is missing here but yet it doesn't work either.

I was wondering about an additional thing for quite a bit - maybe you could describe this shortly as well. What's the difference between `aliasTypeArguments` and `typeArguments`, between `symbol` and `aliasSymbol`, between `type` and `typeAlias`? 🤔 "
"Oops, wrong resource.

"I'm still not convinced the current behavior is best choice. We would throw exception on wrong type, but marshal null as false or zero. That's kind of consistent with JS native behavior.

Cons of current approach is that it's not consistent from if you think about `undefined` and `null` as different types.
Cons of throwing exception on `null` and `undefined` is that exceptions are very expensive."

"@github Thanks, I hadn't realized I had the wrong base. Rebased and ready for review!"
"It looks like making the synthesized record properties implicitly declared has negative consequences for completion. After thinking about it more I'm also not convinced it matches our other behavior. For instance, `get` accessors are not considered implicitly declared because they have some syntax associated with them. I think the same thing is true for record properties. That syntax is also associated with the primary constructor parameter, but I don't think it's wrong to consider the syntax as declaring both symbols.

I'll change `IsImplicitlyDeclared` for the properties back to what we have right now and we can think about changing it later if it's important. The accessors will remain implicitly declared because they really have no associated syntax."
"Some background on the change in this PR...

For a type `keyof { [K in X as Y]: ... }` we want to determine if it is correct to simplify to an instantiation of `Y` with `X` substituted for `K`. Let's say `X` is a union type `'a' | 'b' | 'c'`. Without simplification, the `keyof` operation becomes a union of three instantiations of `Y` with `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'` respectively substituted for `K`. We want to determine if it is correct to simplify to a single instantiation of `Y` with `'a' | 'b' | 'c'` substituted for `K`, which it will be when `Y` distributes over union types in `K`. A complication is that we can't always inspect every constituent of `Y` because it might be circular or infinitely expanding. So, for some types we can't easily provide an answer. However, unless we can prove otherwise, it is reasonable to assume that `Y` depends on `K` _in some way_, or else the entire construct is just a needlessly complicated way of writing just `Y`. 

With that in mind, the best approach is to not simplify unless we can definitely prove a type to be distributive. Originally the code was doing it the other way around (assuming distributive and attempting to prove otherwise), but that meant we'd get it wrong in cases where the analysis was incomplete."
"> Any way you can make those results more readable?

Well, I could hand-construct a table. That seems like a lot of work when BDN should be able to output something I could copy/paste directly.

I run BDN using (e.g., with ""runtime2"" as baseline build and ""runtime"" as diff):
```
pushd C:\gh\performance\src\benchmarks\micro
dotnet run -c Release -f net6.0 -- --filter *ByteMark* *BenchI* *BenchF* *SciMark2* *SpectralNorm_1* *FannkuchRedux_2* --coreRun C:\gh\runtime2\artifacts\tests\coreclr\windows.x64.Checked\Tests\Core_Root\CoreRun.exe C:\gh\runtime\artifacts\tests\coreclr\windows.x64.Checked\Tests\Core_Root\CoreRun.exe -e GitHub
```

The `--join` option would seem tailor-made to put all the different results together, but BDN crashes when using it: https://github.com/dotnet/performance/issues/1855.

> Would be great if you could pick one or two regressions and try to figure out why it's slower.

And the big winner.

It's hard to compare base/diff perf numbers: are the branch predictions wrong/slow? Is the straight-line code more pipeline-able? Not sure how to figure this out... Need some Vtune magic probably."
"> @github Is this fixing #56766 ? 

Yes. Sorry, don't know how I ended up linking the wrong one."
"Thanks @github, I believe I have reached the stage where I have all CoreCLR tests working and some Mono tests too, there are just two remaining failure buckets I haven't yet managed to get my head around and I would definitely appreciate your help:

1) For the two arm64 test legs there's some problem with building the native components; the <code>gen-buildsys.sh</code> script claims the targeting architecture is wrong even though it does seem to get passed in the command-line argument.

2) For the two arm legs there's a configuration inconsistency - we're pulling down a debug version of the framework (just like in pre-existing PR runs without my change) but we seem to be expecting release during the LLVM AOT Compile CoreCLR tests step. Have you got any idea where we're supposed to be overriding the LibraryConfiguration property in this case? In the scripts it defaults to release and I haven't yet found out where we've been switching it over to Debug previously.

Thanks a lot

When enabling the globalization invariant mode on Linux, we'll always fallback to `UTC` time zone which is wrong and a regression from .NET 5.0. We have some docker containers which enable the globalization invariant mode by default on the whole image; the problem will be obvious there.

In .NET 6.0 we have introduced the [Globalization Invariant Mode Breaking Change](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/globalization/6.0/culture-creation-invariant-mode). This breaking change causes throwing exception when enabling the globalization invariant mode and creating any culture other than Invariant culture. 
If the globalization invariant mode is enabled and trying to get the local time zone when running on Linux platform, the creation process will try to initialize the display names of the time zone. This initialization tries to reset the UI culture to `en-US` if it is set to Invariant culture. When we have the globalization invariant mode is on, the UI culture will always be Invariant and cause the time zone initialization to fallback to `en-US` which will throw exception because it is not allowed to create any other cultures in the Invariant mode. We catch the exception and then fallback to use `UTC` time zone instead of the actual time zone set on the running machine.

The fix is simple and not risky which is avoid creating any culture during time zone initialization when the globalization invariant mode is on.

@github @github Looks like I was wrong about the llvmfullaot scenario. I don't have that working. Are there instructions on how to use it on Windows or macOS? I'm not even sure if I am compiling the runtime correctly so guidance here would be appreciated.
"@github Since I'm learning to work with the project, I got a question. Let's say you have a piece of code failing (like the assertion in the log). How do you run clr against this piece of code to debug what is wrong? I believe there must be a better way than just ""copy pasting"" the code into a simple ""Hello world"" project to emulate the behaviour.  Thank you in advance.

"> But there's something else: I think the existing fallback routing logic could still cause problems anyway for URLs ending in .<something>. I wonder if we should do something like re-processing the request as a navigation event if we fail to load an internal resource from the request URL (basically falling back to the host page if our initial guess was wrong). That way, users hopefully won't ever get the weird ""There was no content at _____"" page.

Hmm, it's unfortunate that Android's webview doesn't tell us the reason for the URL load event. WebView2 tells us whether or not it's a navigation, so we know unambiguously whether to use fallback logic or whether to regard it as a 404 if there's no match.

On Blazor WebAssembly/Server, we already have a strategy for dealing with not knowing whether it's a navigation: 

 * If a request matches some existing static content, we serve it
 * Otherwise, if it looks like a non-file (has no potential filename extension in the URL) we fall back on the index page
 * Otherwise, 404

It's not a perfect strategy as `/users/bob.gif` won't get the fallback when maybe you want it to (if that's meant to match `/users/{fullname}`). However people can customize this by editing their `Program.cs`. In practice, very few people have ever hit problems with this and complained about it.

> I think the big remaining question here is how we want to handle URLs that look like they point to internal files, but actually refer to pages. Do you have any thoughts on this @github @github?

(Merging the threads as these perhaps come down to the same question)

I'm definitely happy to give developers control over this. In fact I expect we'll *have to*, because otherwise they have no way to customize this equivalent to what's available for Blazor WebAssembly/Server (i.e., changing the routing config).

The bit I was most thrown off by was referring to loading `/content/file.pdf` as **external** navigation when it's clearly internal to the base href.

Is it possible that the underlying problem here is a matter of terminology? We have this event called `ExternalNavigationStarting`. What if we just passed the whole question on to the app developer by generalizing this to be about all navigations, both internal and external? If we fired an event on *every* URL load, we could preconfigure some `UrlLoadingEventArgs` with a property called `UrlLoadingStrategy` set to whatever our basic guess is (e.g., load internally if an only if it's within the base href - and perhaps in the WebView2 case we take account of whether it's a navigation event since we have that info), then developers can add a handler to customize the logic any way they like for both internal and external loads. Developers who want to override the behavior for a specific subset of URL patterns can match those patterns in their handler, and for all other URLs, leave the preconfigured behavior unchanged.

Does this make sense? Am I up-to-date with all this, or was this already considered before?"
"Reversing a list is not the correct solution. It means that some part of the system is using the wrong representation and possibly exposing it to extensibility. "
"> It's not going to fail if the string is wrong, right? It just won't light up the fixed behavior until you're running on a runtime with the updated OS platform string.

That'd be my understanding, it won't fail, it just won't do anything until the corresponding change is made. I'll make the change"

"Actually, I reviewed that and initially I was confused by how the `EndpointMetadataApiDescriptionProvider` works but after taking a closer look to it I am confident that my convention is wrong and should be removed. We will be able to do something like this when Results type are self-describing."
"Exactly. You are right and I was wrong.
@github Had added MapGroup(https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/41265) pre conditions with param names and I continued the same."
"We were losing ref-ness here, so the conditions for these errors were not even detected. 
Considering this is an error scenario overall, I am not sure if these errors should be reported, but they were not reported originally for a wrong reason - we were not detecting them at all. 
Now the errors are produced as a byproduct of the binding. Whether these errors should be reported or dropped is a separate question and not a part of this fix IMO.

>I can't think of any cases where we would parse an expression type as type syntax which would contain an invalid dimension other than an ArrayTypeSyntax.

Can one create such a tree manually by using SyntaxFactory? Also, I might be wrong, but I think with the recent changes to the parser an element type of the array type could be a nullable array type with sizes as well. Also, since we are going to do the collection of misplaced sizes for other contexts too, and in those contexts parser's behavior around handling of ```<``` might be slightly different, or it might change in the future, I think it would be more robust to create a helper that doesn't make any assumption on how the parser works, simply visits the syntax (by using a syntax visitor) and collects all size expressions from array types in the syntax.

_Already_, this is incorrect. We should move the bindable enum stuff up to the ViewModel because _it's a viewmodel of an enum value_, and make the active values in the ProfileViewModel use EnumEntries for enum fields. Much of the logic that is in the Profiles page CodeBehind should be here.

Then users can check for `if (event.changeKind === TextEditorSelectionChangeKind.Other)`.
If there ever will be the variant `typeInput` (or `remoteEdit`), that would break extensions.
Another boolean flag `isTypeInput: boolean` would not break extensions though, as they cannot really depend on its non-presence.

Alternatively, the enum has no `Other` variant but is stored in a field that can be undefined.
But then users could check if that field is undefined."

"You know this is actually wrong. I just remembered the real reason:
While the D2D-based DxEngine only draws what needs to be drawn, the D3D-shader-based AtlasEngine needs to do alpha blending with the VT foreground and background colors for all pixels.

"This is actually the way I had it initially, but it felt wrong to me hanging on to the pointer like that. I wasn't particularly happy with the current solution either, so I don't mind changing it back if that's what you prefer.

The other option I considered was using a `reinterpret_cast` to get the `OutputStateMachineEngine` from the `_stateMachine`, and from there you can easily get the dispatcher. Something like this:

    auto& engine = reinterpret_cast<OutputStateMachineEngine&>(_stateMachine->Engine());
    engine.Dispatch().SetCursorStyle(cursorStyle);

I like that it doesn't require storing any additional members, but the `reinterpret_cast` seems dodgy to me. I'm not sure that's valid, but we are using that exact pattern elsewhere in the code.

As for holding on to the pointer and just giving the `OutputStateMachineEngine` a reference, I considered that too, but we're instantiating `OutputStateMachineEngine` in a whole lot of places, and having to update all of them seemed like a lot of work. Maybe I'm just being lazy though.

But as I say, I'm happy to go with whichever option you prefer, because I can't make up my mind one way or the other. I just wanted to bring up that `reinterpret_cast` idea first in case you like it."
"I wouldn't have thought so. Obviously the destructor itself is going to be using the object while it is being destructed, so I don't see why it should be any different for other methods. It's just not something that can be relied on in general, because a destructor may be busy cleaning up resources that the other methods depend on. But that's not the case here.

I may be wrong though. I'm not an expert on the standard. Do you have a reference to somewhere that documents this as undefined behavior? If necessary we could always call the `Lock` method manually before the destructor is reached - that's just a bit messier."
"Given that we're immediately returning, there is no ""context"" to this message. *Anything* could cause it.  Additionally, this message looks very similar to the `GetModuleFileName failed` message, meaning *I* will get confused when trying to deduce what went wrong. :-)

"> afaik it's possible to determine statically.

We can determine if a cycle is *possible*. We speculate that in some situations where a cycle is possible it will be irritating to warn the user on the basis of the declaration alone. For example, if a mutable record field is of an 'object' or interface type, the value in the field could be some record that leads back to the original record, and we stack overflow.

We are considering several possible strategies for how to warn on a cyclic record, since ideally we would deliver something which is a warning by default in new .NET projects, and would strongly prefer that the warnings occur only in ""something is definitely wrong"" scenarios.

We also don't have to worry about derived records as much with this strategy. For example, a derived record doesn't need to insert a potentially ""redundant"" call to EnsureSufficientExecutionStack, and it doesn't need to be suspicious that at runtime its base class may contain different private fields than it did at compile time, for example. It can simply assume that its base record derived from object does the check.

No, that's not quite right. The .lastrun files are used to know if the xliff-tasks should check if the translations are out of date, it doesn't determine if the translations actually are out of date.

Looking at the source for xliff-tasks, when they check if a translation is out of date, they actually compare the documents: https://github.com/dotnet/xliff-tasks/blob/cc53f75b404500236364694ff514dcdee2427a94/src/XliffTasks/Model/XlfDocument.cs#L68-L200, but something obviously goes wrong and then that function says that the translation should be updated when it wasn't (because when you run with `/t:UpdateXlfOnBuild` no files are actually modified).

This looks like a bug in the xliff-tasks, I suggest trying to create a small test case and report it to them (or use the small test case to track down the bug in xliff-tasks and just fix it)."
"1. This is my theory: I think recently CLR assembly resolution seems to have undergone a change in that unhandled exceptions from custom assembly resolvers are not masked and go unhandled. When we moved to a new baseline drop with .NET 4.6 recently, we started seeing exceptions in custom assembly resolver in our Tao StartTargetAction (see our TFS changeset 1394695 and 1408896). The prior code was obviously wrong and would have thrown for both cases that were fixed, but it seemed this exception never showed up, and a subsequent resolver resolved the assembly. My _guess_ is before v4.6, CLR was catching the exceptions from custom assembly resolvers while trying to load these assemblies and moving ahead with next resolver to attempt resolution, but now it doesn't (at least not for Load in no context). Someone from CLR team should confirm though.
2. IDE scenario: In the IDE we never seemed to be getting a callback for the satellite assembly. I debugged through the CLR assembly resolution and it seems to be taking a different code path for IDE and command line scenarios (IDE: _http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/reflection/assembly.cs,3012_ while in command line case: _http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/reflection/assembly.cs,3028_ , the later one seems to call custom resolvers and former bails out without event doing so). It seems to be taking different paths on Assembly.CodeBase value, which I am not sure makes any sense for Load in no context. I am not going to dig further into this, but my best guess is Load in no context comes with its own adventures :)

"`dotnet.exe` is manifested to support Windows 10, so if someone is using `dotnet app.dll` or `dotnet run`, Environment.OSVersion is already going to return the same value this will.  Same goes if they've added an appropriate manifest to their app.

I believe your concerns are the same as David's, and as this is a major release of .NET, even if it is technically breaking, I think it's the right trade-off.

A ton of code is doing its own P/Invoke to get a better version, since the version that Environment.OSVersion returns is often either wrong or inconsistent based on how the app is run.  We already use RtlGetVersion in RuntimeInformation:

I've tried to discard changes but nothing, the errors still remains; could it be something dirty in artifacts folder?
The error is due to a wrong generated class (public class _ComWrappers_GlobalInstance_GlobalInstanceTrackerSupportTests _TargetUnix_GlobalInstanceTrackerSupportTests _TargetUnix_)  inside Interop.COM.XUnitWrapper.cs; it has a space inside the class name and i suppose is generated starting from the new unix dedicated project I've created (GlobalInstanceTrackerSupportTests_TargetUnix.csproj )"
"> Maybe it's just me doing something completely wrong but this seems to have broken workload installs in 6.0.2xx previews (using the dotnet6 feed) since there's no 6.0.1 version of Microsoft.NET.Workload.Emscripten on it. Adding the darc-pub-dotnet-emsdk-e8ffccb feed fixed it temporarily but that's probably not the best way to go about it.

Thanks for the heads up.  Looking into it."
"cc @github/jit-contrib PTAL @github 

@github this is practically just your fix, but generalized to any small typed local (for normalize-on-store locals it is necessary too). I think the problem in your PR was just the `genActualType(lclVar) != genActualType(op2)` check, which is always true in this case.

For normalize-on-load locals it seems kind of arbitrary whether we even do this on the creation of the assertion, and it might seem better to do this when using the assertion instead (the ""load""). But since the home of normalize-on-load locals cannot even fit the upper part of the values it seems kind of wrong to leave those bits in the created assertion, so I just went with always doing this when the assertions are created. This would be more complex if we tried doing assertion prop for mismatched accesses of these locals, but we bail on that quite early."
We shouldn't copy this code from XF. 100 percent of the code in XF that influenced focus is wrong and was most likely created to work around fundamental flaws of things that XF made clickable and focusable that stacks of hacks had to be built against.
"This might sound crazy, but I caution against using a timeout of less than 30 seconds if you can avoid it. While you hope it doesn't happen, you never know when this test might be run in a resource-starved environment. 30 seconds is the default timeout for most SignalR and Kestrel tests."
Isn't this wrong if there is buffered data and another send comes in?
"That's why I'm checking the flags and not the RequestQueueMode enum.

Edit: Nevermind, I answered the wrong question. No, you want this detailed error for both Attach and CreateOrAttach. You tried to attach to a thing by name and it wasn't there. For CreateOrAttach that should only happen with a strange race condition."
Please delete these two lines entirely. Mapping `NETCOREAPP3_1` to `netcoreapp3.0` is the **Wrong Thing:tm:** to do.
This code sucks.  I will fix it up later and resend.
Indentation wrong on this line and two lines down.

"
"@github I think it is hard to keep track of the current state of the PR for you. So I tried to collect what is done/missing or needs review/design.

### General

#### Sorting

Sorting is done via the magical `SortingPrefix = ""\uFFFD""` followed by `abstract int SortingGroupIndex` to make sure:
* The items are below other SymbolCompletionItems
* Conversions, Operators, and Indexers are kept together

I have not found any other mechanism for the sorting of the completion items, but using the `SortingPrefix` feels wrong to me.
✔️ Accepted https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#issuecomment-702265486

Do we need to have a test in place to make sure operator/indexer/conversions are between normal members and ""Add using"" (see https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#pullrequestreview-495669239)
✔️ 9d94034c

#### Broken syntax trees

`IRecommenderService`, which provides the methods/properties for completion, handles (probably lots of) corner cases to find the right `container` to look up the symbols. How far should we go to mimic that behavior?
See https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#pullrequestreview-495669239
🔜 

#### String manipulation in `GetChangesAsync`

Needs review. Your markers:
https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496120383
https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496118056
https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r493840482

### Conversion

#### General

Conversions can be defined either on the source type or the target type. We only show the conversions defined on the source type, so the conversions list may not be complete. I did so because otherwise, all types (in scope) need to be searched for a fitting conversion. Test case:

https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/3b4e1aa7ff61500ae4c78f06ddf01c3d4250530e/src/EditorFeatures/CSharpTest/Completion/CompletionProviders/ConversionCompletionProviderTests.cs#L274-L294
✔️ Accepted. Keep as is.

#### Nullable lifting and conditional access

I added support for nullable lifting (`Nullable<int>` -> `Nullable<byte>`) and conditional access `c?.Id -> ((int?)c.Id)`. The related discussion can be found in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r497436721

#### Built-in numeric conversions

Should be fine now. One concern is `decimal` here. The spec defines some explicit conversions and `decimal` is the only built-in numeric type that exposes these as `op_Explicit` methods. I implemented the conversions according to the spec in `GetBuiltInNumericConversions` (including `decimal`), and opt-out of decimal here https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496965837

#### Built-in numeric enum conversions

Added in da2260cc. Only parts of the [built-in conversions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/conversions#explicit-enumeration-conversions) are covered:
* [ ] From sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char, float, double, or decimal to any enum_type.
* [x] From any enum_type to sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char, float, double, or decimal.
* [ ] From any enum_type to any other enum_type.

✔️ Accepted. 

#### Description and glyph

I would like to change the description for conversions. Currently, the description is given for the `IMethodSymbol` of `op_Explicit`. I think it would be better to use the `ReturnType` aka the target of the conversion to build the description. The advantage would be, that we could unify built-in conversions (no `IMethodSymbol`, but a target type) and user-defined conversions.
✔️  Try to mimic the behavior of normal operators. If that is not feasible, fall back to the target type for built-in conversions.

The glyph should be `Operator` for user-defined and built-in conversions. https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496955665
✔️ 

#### Inheritance

Conversion and inheritance are not covered yet.
✔️

### Operators

General test coverage for operators is limited (e.g. no trivia tests) in comparison with conversions.

#### Sorting
Operators are now sorted https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496964177 but the sort order needs to be reviewed. Sorting is tested.

#### Description

Currently, the `IMethodSymbol` description of the operator is shown. I think this is more confusing than helpful. It also suffers from the same problem as conversions for the built-in numeric operators: `IMethodSymbol` is not available. We may present a textual description of the operator.
✔️ Accepted as is. Built-in operators are excluded.

#### Operator lifting

Implemented according to the [spec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/expressions#lifted-operators). Tests: f36861b Implementation: 0d758cd

#### Built-in operators

Not started yet. But I have a test in place that shows the operators, that can be found on the `ITypeSymbol`. See https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47511#discussion_r496959643
I'm not convinced if we should support the built-in operators.
✔️ Accepted as is. Built-in operators are excluded.

#### Numeric promotion

[Numeric promotion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/expressions#numeric-promotions) might be relevant, but I have not looked into it too much.
❓ Optional

#### Inheritance

Operators and inheritance are not covered yet.

✔️

#### Special operators

Other operators that might be useful to suggest could be (not necessarily as part of this PR)
* `await` for task-like types in an `async` method.
* `?.` in a `#nullable enable` context with expression *maybe null*
* `??` in a `#nullable enable` context with expression *maybe null*

### Indexers

Test coverage needs some improvements (e.g. trivia), but in general, I think indexers are feature complete.
✔️ 

#### Inheritance

No tests yet, but should just work.

in the `uxtw` case, the JIT emits w9, but in the `uxtb`/`uxth` cases, it incorrectly emits `x9` instead of `w9`.

Is it acceptable to do like so?

"I'm gonna go ahead and ask the dumb question: Why can't we _automatically_ derive the constraint of an inferred type binding from the constraint of the type being matched?

For example, given
```ts
type Quote<AString extends string> = `""${AString}""`;

type QuotedFirstElement<AStringTuple extends readonly string[]> =
  AStringTuple extends readonly [infer FirstElement, ...infer Rest]
    ? Quote<FirstElement> // Currently errors here, because `FirstElement` is only constrained to `unknown`
    : never;
```
why can't we say ""well, since `AStringTuple` has a constraint of `readonly string[]`, any _elements_ we infer from it should therefore have a constraint of `string`""?

Intuitively, I suspect there's a very good reason for this and that I just haven't thought it through enough, but someone's gotta spring the trap! 😁"

**What's wrong?**

When I was prototyping the NoGC support for regions, I notice that my code ran into a deadlock when running under server GC. When I observe the threads in detail, it appears the threads are blocking on different joins.

**Why does that happen?**
The majority of the code requires that the server GC threads all start together, follow the same path (with respect to joins), and therefore they should all be before the same join and all march towards the next join. 

The issue with this bug is that in a special case, a particular GC thread started earlier than the others and lead towards a different path. 

In particular, in a normal case, we expect all threads to be waiting at the beginning of the `gc_thread_function`. Except for the heap 0 thread, which blocks on the `ee_suspend_event`, all other threads should be blocking on the `gc_start_event`.

However, in the case of `minimal_gc_p == TRUE`, the work to reset the `gc_start_event` is skipped. Therefore when one thread is done with the work, it proceeds to run the next iteration right away without being blocked in the `gc_start_event`, and that is bad because the heap 0 thread will be waiting regardless, so all threads are not running in locked steps.

**The fix?**
I make sure the last thread entered the initial join reset the `gc_start_event` before letting all threads return from `garbage_collect`. This will ensure all threads get blocked on the same waiting condition, just like it was for the `minimal_gc_p == FALSE` case after `generation_to_condemn`.

Note that this fix is independent of `USE_REGIONS`, meaning it might happen in previous releases. We might want to consider backport this fix to earlier LTS.

When we are returning a large region during LOH compaction, the bit shift operator results in an integer overflow (note that `i` is 32 bits integer). With that, `basic_region_start` will be wrong, and thus accidentally reset the allocated pointer on the wrong region, leading to downstream issues.

This change fixes mergeability of tailcall tests: apart from simple
deduplication of the test class names and visibility fixes
I have modified the pointer and reference tests to stop using
Environment.Exit for exiting the test as that kills the merged
wrapper in in-proc execution; I have also fixed them to have main
within a class. In two cases (recurse_ep_void and test_virt)
I found out that I had previously put the Fact attribute on the
wrong method so I fixed that too. I renamed the two C# test
projects to better match the test of tests (widen to widen_r to
indicate it's a release test and thread-race_il_r to thread-race_r
as it's not an IL test).

Thanks

Do you want the likely wrong value in the fallback or a value you know indicates it’s incorrect and you can choose 1f if you want in that case?
"Should this be embedded into the dll or stored in the app package ""assets"" system? Not sure of the perf here. Probably better in the dll as we do not have to touch the filesystem - but I may be wrong. @github once the dll is loded into memory on Android, is it fully loaded, or will this still read off disk? Are there any pros/cons with embedded resources vs assets?"
It is indeed wrong in *some* other templates. I filed https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10414 to fix other templates. But please fix this one here.

"this seems wrong.  We're only getting the first diagnostic with a fix... but how do we know the first diagnostic is the one that is the most severe?

If that's the first diagnostic we get back, we won't show the .ErrorFix category even though that might appear there."
"Ditto @github's point. This is a temporary stopgap until we get Selenium working on Helix.

My apologies @github This PR shouldn't have triggered a validation build. Something is wrong with the exclusions I added in #27484. I'll play a bit more&hellip;
"This is the wrong file. Look at the one called ""post 2017"""
"1. you call root.FindToken 3 times with teh same arg.  Considre just doing it once.
2. you coudl simplify with ```token.GetAncestor<VarDecl>() ?? token.GetAncestor<...>() ?? token.GetAncestor<...>()```.
3. this logic looks wrong.  esp the log about variable declaration and foreach.  Specifically (due to lambdas) you could have these nodes contained within each other.  What you're really trying to say is ""find the closest containing ancestor of any of these types"".  However, this code is saying ""find the closest variable, then find the closest foreach"" with the presumption that the closest variable is closer than the closest foreach.

For '3' you sholud be able to make a test whre you're inside a foreach-variable inside a lambda inside var-decl.  The feature will fail in this case i believe. #Resolved"
"> Is there a way I could see a demo of the options?

Sure.

 * For an example that uses the same technique as in this PR, check [this demo site](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/a11ycasts/tree/master/examples/managing-focus-spa) (which you'll have to clone and run locally). Alternatively wait until a nightly preview 6 build shows up containing the change from this PR, probably today or tomorrow, then do `dotnet new blazorwasm` or `dotnet new blazorserver`.
 * For an example that uses the more complex technique, see [this demo site](https://ns7t5.csb.app/).

In both cases you'll need to run a screen reader such as the Windows 10 Narrator or NVDA. For evaluating them, it's not purely a comparison of the UX, as we also have to make tradeoffs about how general it is across site types, and how well we think developers will understand it and get good results from it even if they don't have a good grasp of accessibility. We need the code to be simple enough that you pretty much can't get it wrong even if you're new or confused.

One other good point about the `FocusOnNavigate` component added in this PR is that, if you do want the ""auto-focus skip-to-content link after navigation"" UX, then you can use `FocusOnNavigate` to achieve that. The main thing the developer would have to implement is the skip link itself."

"would indicate a program error in the actual code that registers the diagnostic.  i.e. we should always create the diagnostics with these locations so it's always safe to assume they're there when fixing.  If they're not, that means the underlying system did something wrong, at which point we can't figure out anythign safe to do at all."
"I'm not understanding the concern.  The original test runs the getter on the item to get the original time and stores it:
```C#
times.Add(timeFunction, timeFunction.Getter(item));
```
It then deletes the file:
```C#
// Deleting shouldn't change any info state
item.Delete();
```
And then it runs the getter again and validates that it hasn't changed from what was stored:
```C#
Assert.Equal(time.Value, time.Key.Getter(item));
```
validating the behavior prior to your PR that Delete doesn't invalidate the instance.  Can you elaborate on what's wrong?"
"I do want it to be collected in the test, I am testing profiler behavior with unloadable statics. The behavior that I want is that the test loads an assembly and unloads it, then verify that GetAppDomainStaticAddress always either returns a valid object or CORPROF_E_DATAINCOMPLETE. 

The problem is that before this change the ALC wouldn't last for the whole LoadCollectibleAssembly method. It would work sometimes but if a GC happened at the wrong point the call to `dynamicLibrary.GetType` would crash the runtime because the ALC was collected and then finalized.

Having the call to unload at the end of the method forces the behavior I want, where the assembly is loaded and then unloaded."

"💡 Also add a test just like this one, but with the argument to the indexer being `int` instead of `Range`. The refactoring should work in this case because the indexer syntax will continue to use the `Slice` method instead of the indexer with the wrong type."
"ClickedItem contains the BindingContext not the Cell.  It's only a cell if the BindingContext is also a Cell which isn't a case where we would still want to pass it in as the cell argument. *NotifyRowTapped* needs to just locate the Cell itself where the event fires. Which is also broken on UWP but this change makes it less broken.

This scenario was fairly edge case anyway because since ClickedItem is the BindingContext it will almost never be a Cell unless it's binding to itself or the BindingContext for some reason implements Cell (which it normally won't). So in almost all cases this cast will just be null and in the cases where it's not null then it's passing the wrong Cell into *NotifyRowTapped*"
"It looks like there are a number of other places in this file that are wrong (`locate`, et al). I think a safer approach than trying to modify all the use sites is to have `file_entry_t::read` take an extra `force_extract` parameter, then pass it through to each `file_entry_t` constructor and store it in a field. Then we can check the field in `needs_extraction` and avoid changing all the call sites"

"Consumers of `isDefinition`:

1. [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/872e6715b4c528c563782d783913a68ca48b3a76/src/vs/editor/contrib/gotoSymbol/browser/goToSymbol.ts#L75) - if regular FAR returns exactly two results, ""compact"" results are requested, and exactly one of the results is not a definition, then the single non-definition will be returned.  (Unfortunately, this is accomplished using two separate tsserver requests.)
2. [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/languageFeatures/codeLens/referencesCodeLens.ts#L45) - CodeLens always drops `isDefinition` results from the references count.
3. VS - The old implementation ignores it.
4. VS - The new implementation appears to (incorrectly?) assume that there will be exactly one definition in the result and uses it (or, in practice, the last occurrence) to determine whether the definition is read or written.

Edit: I filed a bug suggesting VS ignore it entirely.
Edit: The command name for (1) is ""Go to References"" or  `editor.action.goToReferences`
Edit: Using `isDefinition` for (1) will produce slightly wrong behavior if both ""references"" are declarations (e.g. an exported class and an import of that class) - the editor will jump to the other declaration, rather than showing the peek window.  This doesn't seem worth fixing."
"Sadly there are still issues with the fix in this PR as well as the fix in (the now closed) #45628. The core issue looks to be mutually recursive types in which variance is flipped by one of the types. For example:

```ts
type Foo<T> = {
  x: T;
  f: FooFn<T>;
}

type FooFn<T> = (foo: Foo<T>) => void;

declare let foo1: Foo<string>;
declare let foo2: Foo<unknown>;

declare let fn1: FooFn<string>;
declare let fn2: FooFn<unknown>;

foo1 = foo2;  // Error
foo2 = foo1;  // Error

fn1 = fn2;  // Error
fn2 = fn1;  // Error
```

Above, the `x` property in `Foo<T>` witnesses `T` co-variantly and the `f` property witnesses `T` recursively and contra-variantly. The combination should cause `T` to be considered invariant, and it is in the example above. But with a small change to `FooFn<T>` things fall apart:

```ts
type FooFn<T> = (foo: Foo<T[]) => void;
```

Now, because `T` isn't referenced as a ""naked"" type parameter, we don't examine the `Foo<T[]>` reference structurally, but rather attempt to rely on the computed variance--which is in the process of being computed. So, results come out wrong and are potentially sensitive to order of computation. For example, with this PR we get the following behavior:

```ts
foo1 = foo2;  // Error
foo2 = foo1;

fn1 = fn2;
fn2 = fn1;
```

meaning co-variance for `Foo<T>` and no witnessing in `FooFn<T>`. With #45628 we get

```ts
foo1 = foo2;  // Error
foo2 = foo1;

fn1 = fn2;
fn2 = fn1;  // Error
```

i.e. contra-variance for `FooFn<T>` which is slightly more consistent, but still wrong.

The tricky aspect of this example (and others like it) is that invariance isn't revealed unless we examine multiple circular type references structurally and in-depth. Which of course is exactly what we're trying to avoid with the variance computation in the first place."

"> @github, I'm not sure who order this assemblies, but yes, if they are in a wrong order will be a problem. I thought that when blazor generates blazor.boot.json it was being ordered there. @github do you know if the assemblies are ordered before being loaded on blazor?

I think we may be sort of getting lucky because the results of the resolver step insert things in a working order into the json but the runtime doesn't actually require that, it waits for everything to transfer before attempting to load.  I wonder if we should do the same here, it might actually speed up loading because we wouldn't be loading all the other assemblies multiple times."

"Hi @github, and thanks for submitting this PR. .NET API documentation actually lives in a separate repo, [dotnet/dotnet-api-docs](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs). The documentation for the [List.Remove](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs/blob/11242b9ba428e75dcebb3e166c462fdcf2449493/xml/System.Collections.Generic/List%601.xml#L3243) method as defined there seems to be accurate.

"Actually this is the wrong behavior. We wrote in the spec that the server can ignore `StreamItem` and `Completion` messages after the stream has been closed.

"> Another thing I've realized is that if the customer creates their own class deriving from IJSObjectReference and attempts to grab an instance of it via JS interop, the new exception will not be thrown since their own type is from a different assembly. Should we handle this case as well?

That doesn't seem like a problem to me either. We don't need to recognize 3rd-party subtypes of `IJSObjectReference` since there's no way we'd know which concrete instance type to create. So I'd expect it to be treated as `JSCallResultType.Default`, as it already is here.

Good catch on `DotNetObjectReference` though! To be honest, I'm not massively bothered about providing a specific exception if people try to use `JSObjectReference` instead of `IJSObjectReference`. The equivalent would be trying to `@github JSRuntime JS` instead of `IJSRuntime`, and we don't have any exception for that except the default one from DI.

I think if someone does mistakenly use `InvokeAsync<JSObjectReference>(...)` then they'll get an exception from the JSON deserializer saying it doesn't have a default constructor, which is basically good enough because then the developer will have no choice but to realise they are doing it wrong and will have to check docs again or another working implementation to copy/paste.

So in summary I'd be fine with a simplified update like:

```cs
if ((resultType.Assembly == _currentAssembly)
  && (resultType is one of the three known IJSObjectReference ones))
{
    return JSCallResultType.JSObjectReference;
}
else
{
    return JSCallResultType.Default;
}
```

We could even choose to leave the previous implementation as-is, but adding the `resultType.Assembly == _currentAssembly` check seems at least marginally useful."

"Profilers achieve this modification using either [SetILFunctionBody](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo-setilfunctionbody-method) or [RequestReJIT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo4-requestrejit-method). The ReJIT case has its safety enforced by the runtime - each time the profiler calls RequestReJIT we allocate a new ILCodeVersion and every JIT request is bound to a particular NativeCodeVersion which in turn implies a specific ILCodeVersion. In the case of tiered compilation or OSR the NativeCodeVersion being constructed was bound to the same ILCodeVersion as the tier0 native code, regardless if the profiler has created some new IL versions in the meantime. For ReJIT GetAndVerifyILHeader() allows the IL code for a given ILCodeVersion to be provided by the profiler lazily, but it is still logically immutable. Whatever IL the profiler gives the runtime is cached in the ILCodeVersion object and that same IL is returned on every future query. We know that the tier0 code would have already requested IL so all the tier1 requests will be working off the runtime cached copy.

SetILFunction body is the older and less safe variation that currently relies on correct usage by profiler authors rather than runtime enforcement. The documentation tells them that they should not do this:

    > The SetILFunctionBody method can be called on only those functions that have never been compiled by a just-in-time (JIT) compiler.

The current implementation of SetILFunctionBody overrides the IL of the initial ILCodeVersion. The runtime code treats that IL as if it were immutable, but clearly with abuse by the profiler author it wouldn't be. If a profiler is making these types of modifications and leaving tiered compilation enabled then they have already broken the tiered compilation case (tier0 and tier1 would use different IL). I could imagine that getting it wrong in the OSR case has more visble failure modes though. I haven't thought it through all the way, but probably a safer place to be in the future is to re-implement SetILFunctionBody so that it allocates new ILCodeVersions similar to ReJIT so that we can version it explicitly.

```markdown
Context: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/5838

Setting `$(AndroidEnablePreloadAssemblies)`=False, which disables
assembly preloading (see af02a65a), could result in a crash when:

 1. The launched `Activity` isn't located within the ""main App
    assembly"", the assembly built as part of the `App.apk` build, and

 2. The launched `Activity` uses Android Resource IDs, and

 3. Those Android Resource IDs differ between the Library project
    build and the Application project build (usually the case).

This setup is exemplified by the
`DebuggingTest.ClassLibraryMainLauncherRuns()` unit test.

Our current Resource architecture assumes/ensures that there is
Only One™ `Resource` type mentioned by an assembly-level
`ResourceDesignerAttribute` custom attribute, with
`ResourceDesignerAttribute.IsApplication`=true:

	[assembly: global::Android.Runtime.ResourceDesignerAttribute(""My.Resource"", IsApplication=true)]

The `ResourceIdManager.UpdateIdValues()` method looks for this
attribute in all loaded assemblies, and when (if) found, will
invoke the `UpdateIdValues()` static method on the specified type.

The problem is that only the *App assembly* `Resource.UpdateIdValues()`
method does anything, and if the App assembly isn't loaded -- which
may be the case when the `Activity` loaded isn't from the App assembly
and assembly preload is disabled -- then:

 1. `ResourceIdManager.UpdateIdValues()` never finds the
    `ResourceDesignerAttribute`, and

 2. `Resource.UpdateIdValues()` is never invoked, and

 3. Android Resource IDs in non-App assemblies are never updated to
    contain their correct values.

Thus, attempting to use an Android resource may result in unexpected
failures:

	var button = FindViewById<Button> (Resource.Id.myButton);
	// `button` is null, because `Resource.Id.myButton` has the wrong value.

This can result in `NullReferenceException`s:

	android.runtime.JavaProxyThrowable: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
	    at MyLibrary.MainActivity.OnCreate(Bundle bundle)
	    at Android.App.Activity.n_OnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_(IntPtr jnienv, IntPtr native__this, IntPtr native_savedInstanceState)
	    at com.xamarin.classlibrarymainlauncherruns.MainActivity.n_onCreate(Native Method)
	    at com.xamarin.classlibrarymainlauncherruns.MainActivity.onCreate(MainActivity.java:29)

Fix this by *always* loading the App assembly during process startup,
which also happens to be the *first* assembly listed within the
generated `mono.MonoPackageManager_Resources.Assemblies` array, which
is provided to `Runtime.initInternal()`.

* Medium contribution - getting back to the zone is difficult
* Large contribution split into many - is endless :smile:

Don't get me wrong - I know that you are putting a lot of effort in reviewing my commits and in majority of cases your feedback is very timely. I totally value that! And yet, even few PRs that are stuck / having no assignee / reviewer spoil the impression as it feels as irrational use of time.

I still continue contributing, as I really believe in you and the product I use every day, but this frustration persists and I haven't found a cure myself yet :blush:

I absolutely understand the challenge you are facing as a small team under MSFT's quality requirements and I am not coming with a specific suggestion of how and whether to solve this, but just wanted to raise a flag that if a contributor needs to wait a week for a follow up / several weeks to close all required cycles, this can make an  establishment of robust community challenging.

Another **disclaimer**: This above is probably my personal issue and other contributors don't feel so.

In addition, I know I asked this is in the past, but if there are specific areas that can make my contributions more impactful (increasing the ROI of more frequent reviews) please let me know. I tried to solve P1s or tickets with many up-votes - but empirically it hardly increases the odds :blush:

Also I still had to use `Node` as the type for binding.parent, since `node.parent.parent` is a big union type that isn't assignable to BindingPattern. The elaboration points out that CallSignatureDeclaration, at least, is wrong.

I did work around the 2-too-high problem by tracking the previous parent on each iteration:

I think both the assertion created is wrong and it also seems wrong that we allow the replacement of a ubyte typed `LCL_VAR` with a non zero-extended value.

Yeah that is weird. Even if it were to match ICloneable interface annotation would be wrong as it defines the return value as `object` not `object?`. Will open an issue in arcade.

That matches my memories of this. I tracked down the point where we moved to this package and it's PR #29827. 

@github may remember why we needed the non-RTM packages here. My vague memory is that this is still the time when we were dealing with the issues around MS.VB.dll being incomplete. It took a while to find all the places where the incomplete version was being published and fix it to have the complete one. This is likely another one of those cases

"> This is effectively a test issue and not a product issue
> the test server is supposed to be doing the wrong thing and the runtime should be able to handle it.

These sound contradictory? : ) If the runtime can't handle something that it should be able to handle, that is the definition of a product issue.

I think the discussion is making one of a few assumptions. I want to make it explicit which one and make sure everyone agrees with the choice:
a) [Test issue] It was never intended for the runtime to work with a tool that does what the test did (prior to this change)
b) [Product Issue] It was intended to make the runtime work with a tool that does what the test did, however the value in doing so is not enough to justify the dev time, risk, or whatever else involved in resolving it
c) [Product issue] It was intended to make the runtime work with a tool that does what the test did, but it is impossible to implement this behavior on MacOS
d) something else?

A few other misc thoughts:
1. None of the examples I see online suggest that a well-written unix domain socket server would need to delete the socket file prior to closing the socket. If customers write their own servers they probably aren't going to do it unless we doc it and they are diligently reading our docs (a dubious assumption).
2. A tool that repeatedly creates and destroys the socket in a loop probably isn't something a customer would write. However a tool that calls unlink(), socket(), bind(), listen(), accept() in that order and then crashes and restarts at the beginning of the sequence seems pretty reasonable. In theory doing that in a loop with close() at the end simulates what would happen if that server crashed a lot, or if it crashed at just the right moment in time to cause us trouble. I assume we don't know definitively if crashing and relaunching does reproduce the same problem that we see with looping?
3. The description of the issue certainly seemed surprising. If I understand correctly you are saying that poll() returns HUP after the server socket is closed, but calling connect() immediately afterwards is able to reconnect to the closed socket, this generates no error and future calls to poll() do not return HUP?

"I'm not sure I understand how #42485 helps. Before the fix in this PR we'd end up hitting the panic limit at 100 recursive invocations and output an `Excessive stack depth comparing types...` diagnostic, which prints the two types. This happed relatively quickly, but it is nonetheless wrong behavior.

With the PR we keep successfully relating types until we get to 50 levels of instantiations and then stop--but without printing any types, so #42485 wouldn't affect anything. It takes longer for this to occur but that isn't surprising given the very large number of types `XMLHpptRequest` touches if you recursively iterate over all of its properties."
"Another possible conclusion:

We need more analysis of the new errors to figure out how the codefix causes the new errors. I thought that adding `undefined` wouldn't change anything since that used to be the semantics, but it sounds like I was wrong.

In the meantime, we need to decide between shipping a half-baked codefix or not. We've done this before! But for a new pedantic feature, I don't think we'll do much better than codemods written by the experts who adopt new features. So I'm leaning toward not shipping it.

@github do you have an opinion about this?"
"As mentioned - I'm very open to revisiting XState types to see if we can improve the situation anyhow there. I know that this is just a single library whereas this PR potentially impacts a lot more than that though. However, as a dev, I would always take a slower compilation over random errors - so this PR is a big improvement from my point of view.

Is there any rough description for the overall algorithm of how the variance is computed? If I understand correctly then:
- each type parameter has its own variance type
- to compute it we may need to traverse the whole type structurally, because if `T` is passed down through multiple layers then any layer can impact the variance type of the associated type parameter at the root level (and on each level in between)
- potentially when assessing that a type param is invariant you can return early from the algorithm since nothing else can change that
- this information can mostly be cached per uninstantiated type unless conditional types/mapped types do some weird-ish transformations under the hood (not saying that you are caching it, but that such a heuristic could potentially be used, I have no idea if it would be worth it - this is just me trying to understand the problem space better)

I wonder if there is any type construct that makes it impossible for you to take the associated ""slot"" into consideration? Like - I see how ""makes"" type params are taken into consideration, even when a type is ""boxed"" using some other type I can see how the relation gets transitive etc But when I think about crazy conditional & mapped types... I'm getting lost.

In somewhat other words - I wonder if there is anything that we possibly could do to make TS not descend into a particular branch of the structure?"
" geoffkizer : I went back and checked the docs one more time.

"> I'm just going to close this.

If the PR was just about spanification then I don't think we'd be diving, head-first or otherwise. 

Where we started diving into trouble, I think, was the changes re HttpRuleParser.GetNumberLength. This change isn't just an obvious improvement; it changes the behavior of the method in certain cases, which is naturally going to induce various questions about whether and how to make those changes.

The conversation also got unnecessarily complicated because I read your code wrong initially and was confused; sorry for that, I should have read the code more closely."

"> Actually, forget my idea above; [I implemented it](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/68234), but method overload resolution means it _likely_ will call the wrong overload. Examples in the PR.

Thanks for trying that out, @github. The idea was intriguing."
This condition seems wrong. Wouldn't this project fail to build using `dotnet build` even if native assets are already built?
"I picked ulong because it was easier to make robust:

* Ints don’t implicitly convert to or from it (unlike long), so you get compile time checking that we’re consistent everywhere in .NET
* The JS-side code for reading uint64 is simpler and harder to get wrong than if it was reading int64, as there’s no sign bit to account for."

"Is this class really needed? What would go wrong if we set the `GZipSteam` directly to `Request.Body`?

In case there are something that should be done in a new stream, could it at least use inheritance instead of compositions for the known encodings? The providers returns the custom type which implement a marker interface `IDontNeedWrapper` (Very good name, I know!! 😅) and the middleware only wrap the stream if it needs a wrapper.

```
internal sealed class GZipRequestDecompressionBody : GZipStream, IDontNeedWrapper {}

My assumption about the precedence of ExcludeAssets being transitive was wrong.  Since the dependencies of SSP are transitive it lets the non-excluded references win over those marked with exclude.  To workaround we need to add all of them.

"@github something looks wrong here. Both of our main Linux builds produce files named e.g. aspnetcore-targeting-pack-7.0.0-preview.3.22151.16.rpm but we use platform-specific names for the Windows targeting packs. What is the intention here -- aspnetcore-targeting-pack-7.0.0-preview.3.22151.16.rpm or aspnetcore-targeting-pack-7.0.0-preview.3.22151.16-arm64.rpm❔

We'll need to make a change either way -- stop uploading the extra targeting packs (and remove duplicates from the asset manifests) or change the names."
The `else` here looks wrong. `hasErrors` should always be set to `true`. The `if (disposeMethod is null)` should be enough to ensure we're in an error case.
`Empty` has the wrong comparer. The API allows for `null` and uses a cached singleton.
Please remove this spec reference to `InvalidOperationException` for wrong branch kinds. We should return null in that case.

"A NuGet package can come with a variety of assets inside it. For this line there are two types that are important: runtime and compile time. The compile time assets are the libraries that we compile against (ref dlls for example). The runtime assets are items the NuPkg believes are necessary at runtime.

For MSBuild we are hosted inside their process. We never start up MSBuild on our own and create say a workspace. This bulid task is always loaded in their runtime. Hence their runtime assets aren't useful to us (and can possibly confuse our analysis). Hence we exclude them. 

Note: this is how we handle MSBuild assets in other parts of the Roslyn repository. The build task was always ""wrong-ish"" here. "
"Consider adding the following:

```
#else

This helps guard against future changes to the target frameworks that roslyn uses. Consider that in the near future netcoreapp3.0 will be a valid target framework. With this proposed change we would get a compiler error if we forgot to update this file. Without the test would just silently stop running. 

I've been trying to take this approach in all places where we have `#if` as I've gotten this wrong several times."
"👍   Hopefully, all the construction/shuffling of the raw information is clear here for you :)   I try to keep a mental model of all the nodes and what's going on with them, which helps make certain things stand out as looking ""wrong"".  i.e. we had the 'arrow' nodes appearing in two places.  on the 'arrow' local itself, but also as leading skipped syntax for the exclamation.  This violated the strict invariants of the tree.

Thanks!"
"I'm not crazy about the `compMayUseIsa` - again, it fails to communicate that it conveys a contract, i.e. that when it returns false the code must execute correctly even on a target where it would have returned true.

@github - in your discussion above you say:
> `compUsesIsa` should not be used for this case...

I presume you mean `compUsesOrDoesNotUseIsa`.

The issue I have with `compUsesOrDoesNotUseIsa` is that it seems to be asking if we're using the isa or not - as opposed to stating a contract as part of the query. What we really want it to say is `tellMeIfICanUseThisIsaAndIfNotDisableIt` and `tellMeIfICanUseThisIsaButIfNotAllowIt` but of course that's just a bit verbose ;-)

> Could we just have enum compSupports(Isa) and have it return Unsupported, Supported, or SupportedWithCheck?

I don't think that addresses the requirements that @github has expressed - i.e. that the JIT needs to communicate which kind of support it wants, as different codegen scenarios require different answers."
"As written though it unconditionally reports the writes even though we conditionally do the bin place. That seems wrong. "
"The same exception still happens if you get something wrong, it's just if you get multiple things wrong you may not get the same error you used to. I think it's probably below the threshold of what we need to document, i.e. no, but I'm open to other opinions... @github, what do you think?"
"> Have all APIs been appropriately annotated?

I believe so.  The ctor was wrong because adding the message fallback was last minute, after remembering how frustrating it is when exceptions don't do the ""allow null in a more complex overload to represent the default from a simpler overload"" thing for messages."
">// (12,53): error CS0546: 'Derived2.P.set': cannot override because 'Derived.P' does not have an overridable set accessor [](start = 16, length = 121)

">CallerArgumentExpressionParameterIndex [](http://example.com/codeflow?start=38&length=38)

This looks fragile and probably incorrect, at least for delegate EndInvoke method. This implementation assumes that the target parameter is still going to be present and will remain at the same position, which probably can be wrong. The more robust approach is to reinterpret the attribute in the new signature. But before we do this, let's create some tests and figure out if this code path is even reachable in interesting scenarios. Perhaps simply returningh -1 is going to be good enough. #Closed"

"The reverse of `DangerousRetain` is not `Dispose`, it's `DangerousRelease`.

What's wrong with keeping `nameof` as the argument?
Spacing wrong here?
"This is a lot of boiler plate (88 lines in all, over 4 files) for type safety, and I see a potential problem:

- Since EventFoundEventArgs derives from EventNotFoundEventArgs, you could pretty easily fire the event with the wrong Args type and the type system won't complain.

Since there aren't any consumers (test or code), I'm not sure how much overkill this is vs a Found and NotFound event with a type string/enum."
"You are right, I was tempted by wrong change in test. "
"Actually it looks like all your indentation in this file is spaces, and not tabs (wrong editor configuration maybe?)
"
"Actually, this is certainly wrong.  because it means that if the edit to the tree is such that the synthesized `!!` gets moved somewhere else (e.g. to now be a suffix suppression operator), that code will break because it won't see this as two exclamation tokens, but a single token as well.  These merged tokens can't be returned from the incremental lexer as they do not correspond to what the lexer would have produced originally."
@github Is it wrong? Could you please review it? Thank you.
We should add `InferenceFlags.None` so that this ternary can be made typesafe (as-is it'd be possible to pass the wrong kind of enum to `createInferenceContext`)
"Right -- I meant to turn this into a question.

Currently, for delay sign, signing without a key is a _warning_. That seems crazy. I would like to make this an error for public sign. I'm not sure how this could possibly be a warning for public sign, but I wanted to confirm that no one has any objection.

"Given that the value for ESNext has _already_ been volatile, I see no reason not to make this one last churn and then have all these values be _not_ volatile. But I would wait for another reviewer just in case I’m not thinking of some crazy edge case.

(CI will tell you this, but does this affect the compiler API baselines?)"
"I _really_ dislike this regression in the API design of the internal representation of predicates. I would much rather we just added a `modifiers` or `isAssert` field to the existing two kinds (it seems like we're always looking for some pair of two of these kinds as-is!), if the new kinds of predicates going to be treated so similarly. I very much dislike the ""always `undefined`"" on some variant properties and constructor reuse - if for perf reasons, unifying the shapes is a good idea, then i'd be OK with using a constant shape in the constructor functions, but I'd like to hide it from the typesystem behind a cast, such that predicates of the wrong kind do not have the wrong members when looking at completions or exhaustiveness. Plus, it's worth remembering that ""`undefined` or a type"" is a different shape than ""always a type"", so in certain cases, the jitter _may_ perform worse on this pattern, since the shape's members have polymorphic types (which is why I hope the change was made backed up by data).

I _really_ don't wanna go over similar stuff again, but this is very similar to [a discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/5906#discussion_r46604183) we had back in 2015 when I first added `this` predicates, and I _still_ think the extra explicitness from _distinct_ constructors and distinct type shapes is worthwhile in preventing bugs in our own code (as written, this function doesn't prevent you from passing a `parameterName` to a `ThisPredicate`), _especially_ as the space of possible configurations grows. None of these predicates have similar handling in anything other than storage (despite sharing syntax), as evidenced by the liberal sprinkling of ternaries _within_ calls throughout the handling code now."
"~~That's the internal factory.~~ Sorry, wrong place. This is indeed a public factory. I'll remove this change.
"
"> and maybe some SIMD base types

Its most SIMD base types in practice. The SIMD base type should always be the exact type required for the underlying instruction. That includes correctly tracking the sign and size. This is important because there are many SIMD instructions that differ based on size/type and will do the wrong thing otherwise.

It was definitely a bug that the `gtType` wasn't the right thing, however."
"Isn't this just monkey-patching around the actual issue? According to the type definition this property should not be falsy, and `strictNullChecks` are enabled. That means something else is going wrong before already, and this check is just hiding the actual bug."
"That's not a bad idea, but I think if I do that, it'll end up not providing any info as to what part of the access went wrong, versus currently, it's asserting.

I'm not sure if it's a pattern to just try/catch/return undefined in this codebase, though, as that would be sort of the best of both worlds."
"Given the fact that:
- the this is the expected behavior of the traversal and CodeGen
- I haven't found an assembly instruction that could lead us to wrong debug info during just that line.

My proposal is to extend the VariableLiveRange in the case when a variable is being born in the same location it was dying the assembly instruction before."

"First, adding new public members must be discussed before done. See [api-review-process](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/api-review-process.md).

Then, it seems that you have very wrong sense about how dotnet works:

> 1. Inefficient; tries to convert the arguments to another datatype and go through their constructors which also will cause longer computation times and

That happens at **compile** time, not **run** time. Once compiled, the number is stored as is, which constructor to be used has been determined, and the constructor is just copying bytes.

However, parsing from string happens at runtime. It will never be efficient.

> You already have all of the code for the `Parse()` method so why not just use it? Just copy + paste, anyone can do this!

The attributes of `Parse` is far different from constructors:
- Constructors guarantee success. Parse may fail because the string is not a valid number.
- Constructors are **fast** because they have a pre-determined size, and just copy bytes. **Parse is slow**.
- Constructing from primitive numbers are deterministic. Converting from string can be affected by number styles."
"> could you please clarify for me why RBM_NON_BYTE_REGS does not include ESP, EBP? It has only one use but could it be wrong

I believe it's because we don't use `ESP` in the register allocator, and perhaps because `EBP` is sometimes restricted. IMO we should probably just eliminate `RBM_NON_BYTE_REGS` but I don't think it's critical."

"Whell, the reason why I cared about being a possible keyword so much is because according to the comment, the parser treats single identifier as a incomplete member rather than an expression with identifier name syntax only because of keyword completion:

I tried to remove this branch of switch entirely and it didn't break any completions at all, so I guess, this is the right thing to do here. However, it introduced more than 10 failing tests, most of them are just wrong code exchanging 1 set of errors to another, but there were several I consider important, like the skipping mechanics, where parser treats trees `foo using goo` and `bar using goo` identical. I don't feel like I am able to solve this conflicts, so closing this PR. @github If you are interested in taking this one, I fully support reopening it.

I am curious about what the right tool is then? There doesn't really seem to be a great alternative to doing this. In particular, the problem is that of run-time equivalence; the library is intended to be usable both with plain JS and TS. JSX cannot be used without compiling, and furthermore the use-case of safe HTML templates was among the original design considerations that TC39 looked at [when adding this feature to the spec](https://web.archive.org/web/20120124053946/http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:quasis). Tagged template literals are a very natural API for native JS libraries (see also: [graphql-tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-tag), [html tag](https://github.com/zspecza/common-tags#html)).

The approach taken by Svelte/Vue (custom language servers) or tsserver plugins doesn't really scale; writing transformers to turn syntax into JSX seems like a significant amount of work, especially for smaller projects. This approach also doesn't even allow for correctness checks at compile-time."

I'm not sure we want to make this a private API because that feels wrong in the spirit of OSS, however maybe we can add some safeguards.  We could do something like make an internal `IHighlightLayer` property which supercedes the publicly visible one to make sure there's no collisions...

> I assumed by this you meant not using the function pointer type as the direct type being assigned. Let me know if this wasn't what you meant.

It appears that this test was added to test changes made in ```internal static bool IsUnsafe(this TypeSymbol type)``` function. While behavior for this particular test scenario is expected and the test is good to have, I suspect we would get the same error for an array of function pointers. I think this is unexpected, as it is unexpected for an array of regular pointers too. I assume this is due to the fact that the ```GetAnonymousTypeFieldType``` misuses the ```IsUnsafe```. I think the intent was to check for types that cannot be used as type arguments because anonymous types are generic, but it is valid to use an array of pointers as a type argument. I am going to open an issue about that. Once/if that is fixed, it is very likely ```GetAnonymousTypeFieldType``` would stop using ```IsUnsafe``` and this test would stop covering its modification. At the same time it appears that this is the only tests added to cover that. So, I am suggesting to find another scenario to cover changes in ```IsUnsafe```, a scenario that has nothing to do with anonymous types.

You are looking in the wrong type.  According to the spec we are to look in the type of the return of the `Clone` method. #Resolved"
Please add a test like this (`X`) but in which the type of the property in `A` and in `C` are incompatible. There should be an error that the override has the wrong type.
"> Adding the methodimpl entries changes what overridden method the runtime binds the override to. Since we want to remain compatible with previous behavior (right or wrong) for buggy runtimes, we do not want to change what we produce.

> See TestAmbiguousOverridesRefOut in CodeGenOverridingAndHiding as changed in iteration 33. Depending on the order of the declarations, the override would change from being correct to incorrect or vice versa (both tested).

I am just trying to understand why the code is written this way here. Could you, please, help me out with that?

At first, the logic feels wrong because we might not emit a MethodImpl for true covariant return case with ambiguous runtime override. However, one might argue that in the case when the runtime doesn't support covariant returns, we would report an error elsewhere and wouldn't even try to emit. Does this match the line of thinking you use? If so, consider capturing this in a comment.

On the other hand, could this negatively affect retargeting scenario when covariant returns involved? It looks like we would fail to communicate the presence of the covariant return override to the KnownOverriddenClassMethod above, potentially negatively affecting resolution of what the method overrides in that new universe. Is this possible? It might be worth adding some tests around this scenario. We might want to use a slightly different logic in this helper specifically for the purpose of RetargetingMethodSymbol.ExplicitlyOverriddenClassMethod.

> We'd need some sort of dummy implementation layer that mostly just calls into Terminal for the majority of the implementation, and ControlCore just for that one method... that seems dumb.

What if we double down on this info being stored in TerminalCore? And anytime ControlCore needs something from it, it has to call `_terminal.GetFontInfo()`? That way this is all in one place. (this would have to be a follow-up)"

Note `0d 0a` -- CRLF.

If `*.sln text eol=crlf` means ""convert to lf on Linux/Mac"", then now my checkout will be different (dirty?).

"Now I don't want to go too crazypants here, but I'm thinking about future extensions to some degree.

I'm curious if you considered a design where the text buffer figures out the patterns on its own instead of being pumped to do that action by a thread from way outside itself, in this case from up in the Terminal* and friends. 

I'm not saying this one is bad or wrong, but an alternate vision I have is that you would register an object with the TextBuffer that contained a pattern, region of interest, and a callback method/event inside of it. The TextBuffer would just... of its own accord as things are written in on the other methods (and maybe with its own internal, private thread or threadpool worker) grind through the region with the pattern and make callbacks as necessary.

Almost like you have an `ITextScanner` interface with an `ITextMatchFound` callback interface... which might lend itself toward easy adaptation into a COM/WinRT-based plug-in model for arbitrary buffer scanners in the future.

"Some testing thoughts:
- `IsWhitespace` and `IsNewLine` handle some unusual characters. I'm debating how much of those we should try and cover in tests...
- in terms of trying the raw string literal in various expression contexts, here are some more ideas (based on where `IsPossibleExpression` is used in parser): `is ...`, `is (..., ....)`, `is { Prop: ... }`, in ternary `b ? ... : ...`, in array rank `new int[...]`, in expression statement `...;`, in anon type `new { A = ... }`

The way we dealt with this was to make it explicit that things were lazy by taking in `Func<Whatever> createDocumentation`.  That way the caller understaood this would be called in the future.

We use that pattern, for example, in completion lists.  I think that would be far preferred here.

"Something must be going wrong with CI on the `Install Certificates` step:

"Thanks for pointing this out. 

To be honest I am not sure how to deal with it as a correct implementation of `Length` should return the same value before and after calling `Flush`, similar to our [implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/a991e1349e4325770d8e2ddf085184a68cd2555b/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/Strategies/BufferedFileStreamStrategy.cs#L55-L71)

```cs
long before = fileStream.Length;
fileStream.Flush();
long after = fileStream.Length;
Assert.Equal(before, after);
```

I can:

1. keep the code as it is (invalid `FileStream` implementation can in theory run into trouble)
2. move the length fetching and validation after call to `Flush` (it could change the exception thrown for empty files for cases where uses has also provided wrong `access` and `inheritability` which should be very rare).
3. re-fetch the `Length` after the call to `Flush` for custom types derived from `FileStream`

My preferences: 1 > 2 > 3

"> Overall, I'm not saying that doing a binding check is wrong. I'm saying it's not necessary or even recommended per the guidelines we'd settled on.

I want to call this out. 

A binding check is very necessary here and it is recommended.  I realize we've been lax here and we could have done a better job being explicit in the rules. I'll take the blame there in not disseminating this information clearly enough. 

Note: I tried to convey this in some of the compiler talks I did on this topic and many of the cleanup PRs I've sent through to get the parser into a healthier state here. However, as per an above comment, I would often speak in generalities without being as explicit as possible about what this should apply to. I will stop doing this from now on and will be much more precise. 

The guidelines strongly indicate the purpose is to fit the syntactic model and that we should be context free.  Using parse options to dictate diagnostics violates both of those guidelines. As per an above comment, the guidelines were also not created out of thin air. They were provided based highly in the needs of the ide.  

The ide is the primary consumer of incremental parsing. The ide is the primary component that makes validity checks based on syntactic diagnostics. And the ide is the component that has to deal with the perf fallout of options changing. 

The guidelines here were driven by our design goals on how the syntactic subsystem should be as impervious as possible to ephemera like this. 

That's why the pr intentionally does things the right way wrt diagnostics, and it's something we should fix the rest of the parser to do. I've made changes here in the past asking those lines, but I haven't been able to focus my attention on stamping this out completely.

"I added some more statement kinds in the walk up for the 0-length span request, using `isValidExpressionOrStatement` with types
```ts
    type ValidExpressionOrStatement = ValidExpression | ValidStatement;
    type ValidExpression = BinaryExpression | ConditionalExpression;
    type ValidStatement = ExpressionStatement | ReturnStatement | VariableStatement;
```
We then will grab a valid expression from the statement if we did not already stop at an expression. 

There may be a more general way to do this by instead stopping at an `invalid` node, but I get the impression that there are more kinds of things that can be found inside of statements than there are statements that users would be likely to select. There's also a good chance that I'm wrong :)"

Changed a bunch of dprintf levels, eg from 3 to 1 when they are for FATAL_GC_ERROR 'cause you'd always want them; from 1 to 2 in seg_mapping table functions 'cause there could be tons of these when there are many heaps.

Fixed a perf bug in commit_new_mark_array introduced by the refactor change (#1688). This doesn't cause functional problems - we are just calling the same commit_mark_array_with_check on new_heap_segment multiple times.

Got rid of keep_card_live - all it needs is just to increase the cross gen pointer count.

Got rid of useful empty lines/comments/a few vars.

Renamed a few vars to the actual meaning.

Renamed should_commit_mark_array to is_bgc_in_progress and modified a few places to call it instead of duplicated code.

Moved the decision of condemning 1 when bgc is in progress to joined_generation_to_condemn (should logically belong there anyway) which fixes the problem that GCToEEInterface::DiagGCStart was getting the wrong condemned gen in this case.

Make PARALLEL_MARK_LIST_SORT always defined and got rid of code when it's not.

Proper checks for FEATURE_LOH_COMPACTION in a few places.

Changed some really long lines (please try to keep lines under 110 chars in general).

This feels wrong. Overall this seems to be a pervasive pattern in our options code now: having APIs that accept public types but then asserting / throwing if it's not a specific derived type. Makes me question if we have the appropriate design here.
"@github you proposed to do:

>In fact, to make your life easier. Just call: CommonCompletionUtilities.GetWordSpan. However, for the isWordCharacter helper pass: ch => SyntaxFacts.IsIdentifierPartCharacter(ch) || ch == '.'

`CommonCompletionUtilities.GetWordSpan` moves the end further only if the char before the cursor is a word character. Therefore I decided to make a copy of the relevant code. I do also think that we should not rely on `IsIdentifierPartCharacter` here, because we expect an assembly name with an optional `, PublicKey=hash` appendix. So a proper character list would be 
* all chars allowed in an assembly name
* comma, space, and equals sign

Note: I currently use `IsWhiteSpace` which is also wrong because a space is allowed within an assembly name: 
`, <space> PublicKey=`."

"Well, the replacement is just a dumb *in all the code, replace a character* command with no further context information.

I thought of maybe another *fix*. Apart from the one informational issue that tab characters get replaced by space characters I'd say the major problem are the visual issues:

1. Tabs are being fixed to a size of 4.
2. Mid-text tabs do not have the expected aligning effect.

As long as the resulting length is 4 I personally do not care about 1. to be honest. I use them to align mid-text, though.

```txt
apple	red
banana	yellow
lime	green
```

So I am thinking about a fix for 2. I could replace the few calls to `String#replace()` by a custom function that does the current replacements and replaces tabs by either 2, 3 or 4 spaces depending on their offset within the line to mimic their aligning nature. This should have no impact on indentation tabs, but fix mid-text tabs.

```txt
apple   red
banana  yellow
lime    green
```

Currently, this would be the result:
```txt
apple    red
banana    yellow
lime    green

I [asked on SO in the past whether I could enable preserving whitespace](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61024647/how-to-alter-documentation-comment-parsing-or-at-least-disable-markdown-there-in) and I think there is no way currently.

"@github Indicators originally belonged to CarouselView. It was part of the CarouselView code. Then we decided to break the dependency on CarouselView because IndicatorView could be used for any control that the user wanted to create. 

This flexibility came at a cost for people who wanted an easy way to show indicators for a CarouselView, so we invented this way to easily bind the two together. We don't need to easily bind the IndicatorView to a custom control because at that point, the user is already opting for a more advanced scenario.

If we put a strong link on the IndicatorView, it suggests that the IndicatorView is only for the CarouselView, which is false. If we try to make it generic, now the IndicatorView is trying to unbox something to see if it has a known path for binding to it, which is inefficient and is the wrong place for that responsibility. And to have users override that to provide their own link is more code than just writing the bindings, as you pointed out.

I like this convenience property for the CarouselView, but I'd rather remove it than put it back on IndicatorView, personally.

"As far as I remember, the rationale for `EntryCount` being `long` was some sort of compatibility with BCL's `ZipArchive` (which doesn't have `EntryCount` but has a collection which has a signed integer `Count` property).

"My sample was just trying to figure out how things are working and shouldn’t be considered how I want things to work. I wrote the operations in that order because that’s how they worked at the time.

In column-vector transformers, it is expected that the right-most operation happens first.

You can see this with CGContext’s and their transformers. They’re column transformers and therefore the first operation has to come last.

 If you pickup any OpenGL book you’ll see the transformation pipeline written as:

    P*V*M*v = projectedPoint

The vector is first transformed by the Model matrix, then View, then the Projection. If you define `*` backwards, now you have to write:

    v*M*V*P = projectedPoint

Which makes it look like a row transformer (which you just went through a lot of trouble to fix). I think it’s pretty confusing doing the operation backwards. 

**But** here I am of two minds:

1. Defining `*` to be backwards is obviously wrong and is going to create much confusion for people who know matrix math.
2. Making it backwards does mean this breaking change should allow old code to work thus saving me a *lot* of time.

Ugh. Correctness or expediency? I really wish Apple hadn’t played that game. Again, I won’t die on this hill. But it seems so wrong to me.

In commit 53 you removed the following assert that used to be above this line:

I am assuming that failing tests confirmed that the assert was incorrect. Since there was no suggestions to change behavior around when `BackingField` and `BackingFieldForFieldKeyword` return symbols (the suggestion was to prevent them returning different non-null values), then the answer is - yes, they both can return non-null value.

"> You'd expect these two types to be compatible since they'll always have the same sets of properties, but they wouldn't be without the simplification.

@github Sorry, would you mind clarifying that? Maybe with an example, or an explanation of what I'm doing wrong here:

```
type T1<T> = (keyof T) & string;
type T2<T> = keyof { [P in keyof T as P & string]: number };
//type T2<T> = keyof { [P in keyof T as [P] extends [P] ? P & string : never]: number };

interface M {
    a: number;
    b: number;
    [42]: number;
}

function f1(x: T1<M> extends T2<M> ? boolean : never) {
    return x;
}
function f2(x: T2<M> extends T1<M> ? boolean : never) {
    return x;
}
function f3(x: T1<M> extends T2<M> ? (T2<M> extends T1<M> ? boolean : never) : never) {
    return x;
}
f1(false);
f2(false);
f3(false);
```
In the above code, `f1` and `f2` both take `boolean` arguments, which *seems* to indicate that (as you said) T1 and T2 produce compatible types (each extends the other). But if I try to combine the tests, in `f3` it *doesn't* take boolean (it also doesn't tell me what it *does* take).

If I change the definition of `T2` so that the transformation doesn't happen (the commented out version of T2), I get exactly the same behavior (ie, I believe, based on `f1` and `f2`, that the types are still compatible; but something odd happens in the `f3` case)."

I'm not sure how often `.clearinitlocals` is disabled - I suspect not super often, but just didn't want our guidance to end up sending folks in the wrong direction in this case."

"Instead of validating the contents of the cache when we download bits from the network, can we validate them when we load them from the cache?

It is very unlikely that you end up in a situation where the manifest doesn't reflect the contents of the server or that you can't trust the manifest (it's your app, you are serving it).

Worst case scenario, your app is in the middle of a deployment and you got the wrong contents, the likely outcome is that your app will crash and the user will have to reload (this problem is orthogonal to what we are trying here).

"I might need to self block this - Looks like VtPipeTerm is _aggressively_ worse in this scenario actually. Since this is a replication of how WSL interop in conhost is supposed to work, this is a bad sign. I'll test more.

EDIT:
Okay I think I figured out what I did wrong here. It's the change to `screenInfo.cpp:L1451-1469`. Here we're trying to figure out the part of the viewport to invalidate, based off of what lines in the _new_ buffer are wrapped. This was supposed to be a heuristic on ""what lines that were wrapped that might have changed"". But that doesn't work - in the scenario where we're going from a wrapped line to a non-wrapped line, after the resize, all the contents of the buffer below the wrapped line will have shifted up one line. However, the problem with this algorithm is that we're only checking the wrap state at the end - which means that since there are _no_ wrapped lines in the new buffer, we never invalidate, and the host and terminal get out of sync.

I thought this was a bad heuristic originally, and I guess I'm glad that my gut was right about that.

my repro is essentially print a line that doesn't wrap, resize width down to have it wrap, then resize the width up to have the line unwrap. Chaos ensues."

I am unable to reproduce the error locally (tried both with XA `master` and this PR). @github, @github any clue as to what might be going on?"
"Yes I'm using duplicate tab(with keyboard shortcut and from command pallete), It doesn't work, it goes back to starting directory.

"Reading through `ModifyEntriesFromPreviousTable` I believe their is an assumption that `newOutputs` here is order dependent. Basically that the source generator providing `_func` to this node has an obligation to produce the same output in the same order for the same input.

Most importantly if the generator violates that what goes wrong? Do we gracefully recover somehow? "

"So this 0135 error is a bit similar to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/troubleshooting/mtouch-errors#MT0091 in the sense you want people to update their Xcode or enable the linker. I think you should copy or take inspiration from the detailed ""enable the linker"" explanation in 0091.

Also I have to admit that I'm a bit confused with the general wording of this error, not sure I understand.

If I go line by line:

> Did not link system framework '{0}' as Xcode SDK '{1}' is too old.

ok, couldn't, link Xcode too old.

> Xamarin.iOS contains API bindings for the listed framework which is newer than the Xcode used.

The framework is newer than the Xcode used? That sounds weird. I don't understand this.

> They may fail at runtime as we are not linking against the required system framework.

The listed framework may fail or the API bindings :P ? The error is about a system framework and it's also the last element of the previous sentence so I think that grammatically ""they"" applies to the listed frameworks (am I wrong?).

Overall I'm confused with those 2 middle sentences that are supposed to explain the core of the issue (maybe it's just me).

If I try really hard to parse this error I get that it's basically https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/troubleshooting/mtouch-errors#MT0091.
We can't ""link"" some frameworks because they are simply not available in the currently selected Xcode (too old). Some APIs in Xamarin.iOS depend on those frameworks (hence the error) and because we couldn't link them it's gonna fail at runtime. You can either upgrade Xcode to get the new framework or enable the linker so those APIs are skipped.

Anyway, we _might_ need to rephrase this, it's not crystal clear for me on the first read, it's very technical and hard to digest and I don't know if users will just understand this."

"Yes, interesting disconnect there. The comment isn't wrong, in that raw strings can be _potentially_ dedented, but definitely outside the scope of this PR."
"I took another look at this just now and I think that each `ProcessManager.*.cs` needs its own copy of this method since it is called from `EnsureState` in `Process.cs` (which I _think_ is for all platforms).

"This one's confusing me, so I'll try to explain the logic. Please correct me if I got it wrong:

The [rmdir docs](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rmdir.2.html) say:

```
ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.
```

So if we get ENOENT, it means the current entry is a symlink. And only if the current entry is the top level, we avoid deleting the contents of the link _target_ recursively. We achieve this by returning `true`, to assume the operation succedeed.

Was that correct?


But then, why do we throw (by going to default) if the current entry is not the top level?"
">> 4 tests failed, 103 tests passed.

> @github those are unrelated to your PR and already fixed in HEAD (just rebase to get the fix)

I was wrong (same suites but different reasons or I opened the wrong log file). 

The failures are related to the PR and are still present in the last build (along new ones).

```
[FAIL] PreserveTypeWithCustomAttribute : type 
[FAIL] IntPtrSizeTest : empty body 
Tests run: 83 Passed: 81 Inconclusive: 0 Failed: 2 Ignored: 13
```

Those might have to be _adapted_ since the dotnet linker behave differently. Lack of custom preserve and how IntPtr.Size is removed.

The two ""new"" ones happens because the dynamic registrar is removed - but some tests are not happy (meaning something else is missing to make this work properly)."
"> This structure has nothing to do with stack. Is the comment wrong?

Yes.
I should add a macro at here, `prestup.cpp-Line:2363 #elif  defined(TARGET_ARM) || defined(TARGET_ARM64) || defined(TARGET_LOONGARCH64)`

But I also have a question.
Previous within the .NET6-runtime, the initialing code is in the file `src/coreclr/zap/zapimport.cpp:489`.
But now the zapimport.cpp had been deleted.

"Vector restore happens at two places: 
- At the end of every block, whenever any `largeVectorVars` was partially spilled
- At the locations where we see the use

While it should be safe to eliminate the restores (and hence the saves) that happen for #1 above if the block is a THROW block, but there can be a scenario (as you pointed out) where eliminating save/restore will be wrong:

```asm
save(Vx)  ; <- shouldn't be eliminated because of the use
CALL ...
Vx = restore() ;  <- shouldn't be eliminated because of the use
 = use(Vx)
...
THROW
```

Since UpperVectorSave refpositions are created when we build kills, it is hard to look ahead to see which ones of them will be used (and hence restored) and thus can be eliminated. For e.g. in following case, we can (should) eliminate the unnecessary save/restore.

```asm
save(Vx)  ; <- safe to eliminate
CALL ...
Vx = restore() ;  <- safe to eliminate
...
THROW
```

To summarize, I was trying to eliminate vector saves, but it might not be safe (as Bruce pointed), so I will just try to at least eliminate the restore that happens at the end of the THROW block."

"I still think @github’s example is a _little_ suspicious with `--strictNullChecks` but without `--noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. The inheritance I think is immaterial; what we’re asking is, under what circumstances does it make sense to allow

```ts
interface Foo {
  [key: string]: string;
  foo?: string;
}
```

With _just_ `--strictNullChecks`, the type of the property signature of `foo` _is_ `string | undefined`, but reading an arbitrary string key will give you a `string`. Everyone knows that you’ll actually often get an `undefined` value at runtime (in absence of a Proxy or something), but our stance has always been one of _consistently_ ignoring the possibility of `undefined`—your other properties must be assignable to the index signature type, not the index signature type or `undefined`. That way, when you read an arbitrary key and get the result `string`, at least we don’t _know_ of any property names that would give you something different. This is a pretty weak defense in my opinion, but it’s the historical status quo. I think it wouldn’t be totally unreasonable to change our stance and allow optional properties alongside non-nullable index signatures. Then, when you read an arbitrary property and we give you a `string`, well, it’s wrong, but the undefined-ness of `foo?: string` doesn’t make it _more_ wrong than the undefined-ness of the infinite number of missing properties.

If we add `--noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, it starts to make more sense. Now, reading an arbitrary key of `Foo` will give you `string | undefined`, so the read type of the index signature and the read type of `foo?: string` agree. Having thought about it for a while now, I have no reservations about allowing this.

If we _also_ add `--strictOptionalProperties`, it feels like all the remaining holes can be plugged:

```ts
interface Foo1 {
  [key: string]: string;
  foo?: string; // ok, because like the index signature, this means if the property is present, its type is 'string'
}

interface Foo2 {
  [key: string]: string;
  foo?: string | undefined; // error, because unlike the index signature, this property may be set to 'undefined'
}

declare let dict: { [key: string]: string };
declare let foo1: { foo?: string };
declare let foo2: { foo?: string | undefined };

dict = foo1; // ok, because `foo` is 'string' if present
dict = foo2; // error, because it may introduce a present-but-undefined property
```

This gets to the essence of #41921—when you’re assigning an object with optional `string` properties to an object with a `string` index signature, we wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt that what you _mean_ is that those properties are either `string`s or _not present_. We had no way of enforcing that, and needed to reduce the breakiness of fixing #41418, so we chose to allow the unsoundness, given the rest of the unsoundness around index signatures. But if we had had a way to distinguish undefined and missing properties from the beginning, I think it would have worked the way I wrote it above. Unfortunately, the examples in that last code block really depend on _both_ `--noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `--strictOptionalProperties` being set to make sense, and I don’t know if it’s worth it in practice to treat that unique combination specially. But conceptually, it really does feel like they complement each other nicely and finally make sense out of the index signature story."

The developer could still support this if they wanted by adding their own handler for `ExternalNavigationStarting` and indicating that they want the URL to be opened in the webview (but this does seem like a bit of a hack IMO). Whereas, if we always loaded internal resources in the webview, I don't know that we have a way for the developer to override that behavior to support external navigation.

But there's something else: I think the existing fallback routing logic could still cause problems anyway for URLs ending in `.<something>`. I wonder if we should do something like re-processing the request as a navigation event if we fail to load an internal resource from the request URL (basically falling back to the host page if our initial guess was wrong).

From what I can tell AnsiBSTR, LPSTR, LPTSTR, and TBSTR are all partially wrong or unimplemented in netcore. AnsiBSTR only goes one way, LPSTR is treated as a UTF8STR for legacy reasons (not applicable in netcore), LPTSTR has this issue so I think I could cook up a test case that would cause a crash, and TBSTR only goes one way.

Sadly, only AnsiBSTR, BSTR, and LPSTR are covered by the CoreCLR tests right now, but I think I should be able to reuse the existing tests with the other types as well. There are a lot of interop-related test failures, but hopefully that will clear up any with the strings themselves."

I didn't even look at that.... I was looking at the last column with ""GPU Engine"" and watching it disappear. My theory would be that the GPU is wasting more time because it's receiving so much data off the bus after the CPU rasterizes it and that's what makes that spike. It's not like the GPU isn't involved in displaying the frames still.... it just isn't responsible for assembling them.

"This updated path for `configure` doesn't look right. `$(_MonoPath)` already includes `$(_SourceTopDir)` (unless my suggested change is done), so I believe that this is equivalent to `$(_SourceTopDir)\..\$(SourceTopDir)\external\mono`, which would be wrong.
"
"So, a couple notes outside of the discussion about Solarized:

* This change was cherry-picked into the release branches (release-1.1 at cb52de02e70b8872471db39e4945d560f8736d29, release-1.2 at ccf201fe440fd8163115f8630eb4a0529d420f50), and the tags are made on the commits in the release branches.
* #293 is fixed to the best of our ability
   * James fixed color representation through the entire stack, which exacerbated an issue in PowerShell (PowerShell/PSReadline#830)
   * Because of that issue, we broke `40` _specifically for PowerShell_ (#6810). This is very narrowly targeted. Once the change that fixes PowerShell/PSReadline#830 (PowerShell/PSReadline#1626) has a wider install base, we'll revert the workaround and `40` will work fine.

---

You're right that we're not following Solarized's ""canonical"" color mappings... but neither is gnome-terminal. Generally, though, I'm concerned about this:

> ""your dark background has the wrong brightness relationship ...""

That's fair and well-specified from a Solarized standpoint, but any other terminal would consider the default Solarized mappings to have the wrong brightness relationship between ""black"" and ""bright black"". Nobody has strictly defined that ""bright black"" must indeed be brighter than ""black"", but it's right there in the name.

I'm checking `base02` on `base03` because we _do_ see that color combination in the wild. PowerShell's default configuration prints `90` on `49` (or `90` on `40` in traditional consoles predating Windows 10). If we use [cmd-colors-solarized](https://github.com/shanselman/cmd-colors-solarized) _or_ the official upstream mapping, that means printing one base color on another base color.

Personally I'd rather yank all reference to Solarized from this repo forever than move color indices back and forth for all time, but that doesn't mean I'm not amenable to discussing it :smile:"
The entire rid is already included. I think it’s more useful to look at the entire string rather than a single character. It’s wrong in context not on its own.
"Ok, revisited the PR. Again, downloaded the branch and here's what I'm seeing (numbers refer to the points from [this comment](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/pull/11153#pullrequestreview-760344068)):
1. `moveFocus` by `parent` passes the key down to the active terminal there is no parent.
   - [Resolution] ✅ Discussion showed I was wrong about the expected behavior. This works as expected!
2. `search`
   - [Resolution] 🏈🦶 punted to #11327 
3. `sendInput`/`copy`/`paste`: 
   - [Resolution] 🏈🦶 punted to #11327
4. `closePane`: Still cool 😉
5. `moveFocus`: I expected to see the focus move to another group of panes, but idk if that's even possible given the current infrastructure?
   - [Resolution] 🏈🦶 punted to #11327
6. `togglePaneZoom`:It feels a bit weird that you can only move focus using the mouse. `moveFocus` here makes the newly focused pane be the only one that's zoomed. Curious what others think of this, and if there's an ""expected behavior"" that I can't put my finger on (heck, this might be the correct behavior 🤷).
   - [Resolution] 🏈🦶 punted to #11327
7. `resizePane`: Still love it! 🥳
8. `toggleReadOnlyMode`: If we have a mix of states, we toggle on each of them. That seems right based on the action's name, but I wonder if the user would prefer one of these two ideas:
   - (1) toggle the top-left pane state, and make all other selected panes match that new state.
         - Inspiration: this is how MS Word handles text formatting with mixed states (i.e. ""hello world"" where one word is underlined and the other one isn't; if it's all selected and you press <kbd>ctrl+u</kbd>, we toggle the first run's state, then make the rest match it)
   -  (2) introduce a `setReadOnlyMode` action? (I like this idea less btw)
   - [Resolution] ~🏈🦶 punted to #11327~ EDIT: It's already done!!
9. `splitPane`: ❌ Still seeing this crash ☹️
10. `scrollUp`/`scrollDown`/etc...: I expect the scroll commands to be sent to each of the terminals.
   - [Resolution] 🏈🦶 punted to #11327
11. `adjustFontSize`/`resetFontSize`: works perfectly! 🙌
12. `toggleShaderEffects`
    - ❌ broken, but differently. Now, if a subtree of 4 panes are selected, the 3 non-active panes toggle properly, but the active pane flashes then does nothing. I invoked it using the command palette, if that does anything.
13. `setColorScheme`
    - ❌ broken (same as before) the new scheme isn't _previewed_, it does properly set it after you select it, however. Seems to flash? Works on `main`.

Still want (9), (12), and (13) though fixed since (9) is a crash and (12)/(13) are regressions. After those get fixed, I'll approve and we'll merge this 🙂"
"In my eyes this is wrong because we should never get a `BoundExpressionStatement` here - but I can live with that.
And every case where it returns null is a (silent) error."
"Unfortunately this part becomes a bit complicated.

We can't do this, because it will make the api diffs for legacy Xamarin wrong (in fact this should be bumped to the apidiff reference from the `xcode13-ios` branch now).

However, we can't bump to the bundle.zip from the `xcode13-ios` branch, because it won't contain binaries for Xamarin.Mac (nor the .NET assemblies for that matter).

We really need a different bundle.zip for every platform, but for legacy Xamarin that's out of scope for this PR.

But what is possible is a middle ground: use a different url for .NET assemblies, and even better would be to make it possible to use a different url for each platform, so something like this:

```make
APIDIFF_REFERENCES_DOTNET_iOS=...
APIDIFF_REFERENCES_DOTNET_tvOS=...
APIDIFF_REFERENCES_DOTNET_macOS=...
APIDIFF_REFERENCES_DOTNET_MacCatalyst=...
```

because it's entirely possible we'll end up in the same situation again at some point (different stable versions of iOS and macOS), and this way we'd have a solution since we could have different reference bundles for different platforms."
"I don't understand these two paragraphs.  This is saying you can define a GeneratedDllImport with a jagged array, it'll marshal successfully and you won't get any indications you did something ""wrong"", but we still say it's ""unsupported""?  At a minimum if that's the case we should output a warning diagnostic even if we still allow code generation to proceed, but if we really want this to be unsupported, shouldn't we just block it entirely?  Or if there's no good reason to have it be unsupported, just support it."
"The answer to both your comments is that this code is closely couple to the result of `getSpecialPropertyAssignmentKind`, which returns `ExportsProperty` in two cases.

In this case, the code is **wrong** and should be checking `lhs.expression.kind`. I will fix it."
"It's easy to add, I think.

(Also, adding it exposed a bug: functions required `@github` in order to trigger the refactoring at all, which is wrong.)"
"This enables the analyzer, so I think it's good to have. Our guidance for most teams will probably be to mark everything IsTrimmable. There's less chance something goes wrong (e.g., you start publishing the project as a library, but forget to mark it trimmable for others)."
"It is, this was just the wrong place to use it.

"If users were able to put `override` on method, you'd get:

```
Non-abstract class 'Child' does not implement inherited abstract member 'myMethod' from class 'Parent'.
Method 'method' of 'Child' must override a super type method (or some such)
```

I'm arguing that it's useful to get the second error message, to more quickly determine what went wrong.

There's also the scenario where you refactor such that an interface you implement no longer needs you to implement `method`. With `override` on implementing methods, you'll get an error for code that's no longer useful."

"> What if you're not in the codestyle layer? Can you still use these? Should you? Would it be bug if you used the wrong one?

You can use any of the overloads that are available in the particular layer. The overloads are mostly for convenience, so that starting from a Document you can easily get the options needed. 

The only decision to make is whether it makes sense to read the options eagerly (using XyzOptions) or whether they need to be read lazily (using a XyzOptionsProvider). The former is preferred in code that operates on a single document. Then you can parameterize that feature with specific options and read them upfront. If a feature operates on multiple documents that potentially come from different projects then you have to use the provider since we do not want to load specific language binaries upfront if they won't actually be used. If there is a performance concern with reading options from editorconfig documents upfront (perhaps a feature only needs the options rare cases) then you can also use the provider pattern.

however this may not fix all instances of that assertion being triggered, as it's a generic assertion failure crash for any zero-or-less-length text spans; so any time span math happens on ill-formed nodes, this stack trace is liable to appear. I'm hoping, as I said [here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/47535#discussion_r789178876) that this should defensively remove the assertion crash in most cases by eliminating the string literal span math when it's obviously wrong, however odd span length may still filter in via other means (eg, from bad initial node positions and lengths)."

TL;dr `publish` fails on any blazorwasm project with VS17

A recent commit[1] moved initializing `$(_WasmIntermediateOutputPath)` from
a target, to project level `PropertyGroup`. It is set as:

`<_WasmIntermediateOutputPath>$([MSBuild]::NormalizeDirectory($(IntermediateOutputPath), 'wasm'))</_WasmIntermediateOutputPath>`

The `NormalizeDirectory` call converts this to a full path, presumably
using the current directory.

Because we are setting `$(_WasmIntermediateOutputPath)` at the project
level, it gets evaluated during the evaluation phase. And the current
directory doesn't seem to be set to the project directory at that point
in VS. So, `$(_WasmIntermediateOutputPath)` gets a wrong path like:

`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Preview\Common7\IDE\obj\Release\net6.0\wasm`.

And then when actually publishing, it fails to create this directory
with:

`Unable to create directory ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Preview\Common7\IDE\obj\Release\net6.0\wasm\"". Access to the path 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Preview\Common7\IDE\obj\Release\net6.0\wasm\' is denied.`

Fix:
Set the property in `_InitializeCommonProperties` *target*, at which
point the current directory is correctly set.

Note:
- This doesn't seem to be reproducible outside VS
- It happens only on `publish`, because that's when the wasm targets
  come into play.

Who knows. I sometimes do crazy things. Cleaning up.
"Formatting is wrong here and it using spaces, "
"I confirm this issue is in the Java implementation on the Android DateTimePicker.

Here is a short Kotlin snippet that reproduces the issue:

```kt
package com.example.myapplication

import android.app.DatePickerDialog
import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.fragment.app.Fragment
import android.view.LayoutInflater
import android.view.View
import android.view.ViewGroup
import androidx.navigation.fragment.findNavController
import com.example.myapplication.databinding.FragmentFirstBinding

/**
 * A simple [Fragment] subclass as the default destination in the navigation.
 */
class FirstFragment : Fragment() {

    private var _binding: FragmentFirstBinding? = null
    private var _dialog: DatePickerDialog? = null

    // This property is only valid between onCreateView and
    // onDestroyView.
    private val binding get() = _binding!!

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {

        _binding = FragmentFirstBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        return binding.root

    }

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)

        binding.buttonFirst.setOnClickListener {
            if (_dialog == null) {
                _dialog = DatePickerDialog(this.requireActivity())
            }
            _dialog!!.updateDate(2000, 1, 1)
            _dialog!!.show()
        }
    }

    override fun onDestroyView() {
        super.onDestroyView()
        _binding = null
    }
}
```

This snippet can be used to replace the `FirstFragment.kt` that is generated by the Android Studio Basic Activity template and reproduce the issue.

The important line here is the call to `updateDate`. If we didn't have that call, the calendar will show up as usual, but it will be on the month we left the DatePicker, instead of the selected Date.

Before we talk about the underlying code, let's start with a rough idea. The `DatePickerDialog` contains a `DatePicker`. A `DatePicker` interacts with a `ViewPager`, the idea is that the calendar for each month is a `Page` (or an `Item` in the code). Changing the date is essentially changing the `Item`.

When the `_dialog!!.updateDate(...)` is called, the underlying code will eventually reach [here](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/ebddedfd9b4380607eed95decbe5178516bca976/core/java/com/android/internal/widget/ViewPager.java#L523) to `setCurrentItemInternal`. For the very first call, the `mFirstLayout` flag is true, so it will do the right thing and put the calendar in.

For the later call, if we happen to be on the same page, the condition check [here](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/c5d02da0f6553a00da6b0d833b67d3bbe87341e0/core/java/android/widget/DayPickerView.java#L311) will fail and nothing happens, it stays good.

However, if the user flipped to the other months but quit the dialog, then the condition would turn `true`, leading to a call to `setCurrentItemInternal`, the `mFirstLayout` is no longer true, so it will actually call `populate` [here](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/ebddedfd9b4380607eed95decbe5178516bca976/core/java/com/android/internal/widget/ViewPager.java#L535).

It would have been fine if `populate` actually does it job, but it doesn't. Perhaps because we called that while the `DatePicker` is not currently on the screen, the `windowToken` is `null` and the actual work to set the item is by-passed [here](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/com/android/internal/widget/ViewPager.java#L927). Worse, the item is updated, so we don't have a second chance to get it fixed, that why the calendar is empty.

This concludes the root cause of the bug. I don't know why it worked on previous versions, the files I mentioned above were not changed for at least 2 years.

As an experiment, we can replicate what we did in the Android experiment and comment out the setting of the `Date` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/blob/cf2dc1937f18896b878b5ed08f56dc7445618abd/src/Core/src/Handlers/DatePicker/DatePickerHandler.Android.cs#L142). With that, we can get the behavior just like we would get in Kotlin. Basically, the calendar will show up, but not on the current month.

I think we should [file an issue](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/report-bugs) against Android at least. 

With respect to our code, there are a few things we could do:

1. Do nothing, wait until the Android people fix the bug, it will not work perfectly for some phones. Hopefully, it wouldn't be long until they fix it so the number of phones got impacted is limited.
2. Comment out the `setDate`. The calendar will show the wrong page (but the users flipped it there), or
3. Set it `null`, we will have the perfect behavior, but that comes with a performance penalty and code complexities to handle it could `null` in many places.

If I knew how to specialize in API version, we can also specialize the comment out of the `updateDate` only for the broken API versions, that way we will have the perfect behavior most of the time and not have a performance penalty. That would be my choice."

"Thank you very much, @github and @github, for explanations!

Then, I think that we need to keep asserts in the following two cases only:
1. InitializeCompletion
2. TryCommit

The reason for this: we work with SourceText and Snapshots and need to be sure that we exclusively process them. I'll keep asserts there and add some comments. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

"I can't tell what you're advocating for; your comments contradict each other.

The pattern you're citing from MSDN is exactly what's already happening in that current code, except that their version sets the `disposed` flag to true after executing the `if(disposing)` block instead of before. (Whether it's better to set that flag before or after is a separate discussion, but I believe that ""before"" is the safer option.)

> When you call Dispose(false), it sets _disposed to true but does NOT actually dispose (the if block doesn't get executed).

""the if block doesn't get executed"" is not the same thing as ""does not dispose"". The `if(disposing)` block is for cleaning up managed resources when our code calls `Dispose()`. We can't clean up managed resources during `Dispose(false)` because we're being finalized, and the state of the managed resources is indeterminate. (It wouldn't do much good anyway, since by this point they're likely being garbage collected.)

> When you call Dispose(true) later on, it assumes the object is already disposed, so it returns.

That's not a thing. `Dispose(false)` signals that the finalizer is calling `Dispose()`; the object is being destroyed/finalized. There is no subsequent call to `Dispose(true)`. 

The converse is also true; if `Dispose(true)` has been called, `Dispose(false)` never happens, because the root class's `Dispose()` implementation calls `GC.SuppressFinalize()`.

> MasterDetailPageRenderer.cs and NavigationPageRenderer.cs have the correct implementation.

Their implementations are subtly wrong. In both, if `Dispose()` is called by the finalizer (i.e., `Dispose(false)`), `_disposed` will never be set to true, and nothing will prevent a double-Dispose situation. In those two classes we happen to be fine because there are no unmanaged resources to handle (i.e., nothing outside of the `if(disposing)` block), so no disposal logic gets run multiple times. We _are_ incurring a slight performance penalty, though, and that's something I hope to fix soon.

"Copying the comment I made in the commit related to panel part

I think this is still not a proper solution because I observed that context menu actions on panel title is not showing hidden views. 

So I took back a step and looked into our views framework and I see we have following top level pieces 

- CompositeBar (ActivityBar & PanelBar) 
- ViewPaneContainers (Viewlets & Panels)
- [ViewDescriptors](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/88e98034a84ecbf65b7650f664a73a990457120a/src/vs/workbench/common/views.ts#L210) & [ViewsModel](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/88e98034a84ecbf65b7650f664a73a990457120a/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/views/views.ts#L325)

If we separate these into Model & UI sections

- **Model:** ViewDescriptors & ViewsModel
- **UI:** CompositeBar and ViewPaneContainers

I felt that it's wrong that state is flowing between UI pieces. Instead we shall have the state in the model and let UI pieces update with model changes. 
It means UI parts need access to `ViewsModel`. So here is my idea:

- Have only one model `ViewDescriptors` that contain all information about view descriptors (all, active, visible).
- All UI pieces use this model to render icons, titles, actions & views.

We can discuss in detail directly.

"Unrelated, I only just found out about the VS c++/winrt plugin.

The proposal explicitly says that [import assertions must not affect how a module is evaluated or resolved](https://tc39.es/proposal-import-assertions/#sec-hostresolveimportedmodule):
> [...]
> The implementation of HostResolveImportedModule must conform to the following requirements:
> - [...]
> - moduleRequest.[[Assertions]] must not influence the interpretation of the module or the module specifier; instead, it may be used to determine whether the algorithm completes normally or with an [abrupt completion](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-completion-record-specification-type).

In other words, if both these two imports succeed they must resolve/evaluate the same file:
```js
import { A } from ""pkg"" assert { ""resolution-mode"": ""require"" };
import { A } from ""pkg"" assert { ""resolution-mode"": ""import"" };
```

The imports assertions proposal [even mentions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions#follow-up-proposal-evaluator-attributes) a possible follow-up proposal that would allow what you need, but it would be a separate proposal (with likely different syntax).

"> Should this be embedded into the dll or stored in the app package ""assets"" system? Not sure of the perf here. Probably better in the dll as we do not have to touch the filesystem - but I may be wrong. @github once the dll is loded into memory on Android, is it fully loaded, or will this still read off disk? Are there any pros/cons with embedded resources vs assets?

My initial thoughts on `appsettings.json`, is that ASP.NET uses it as a file so you can edit the file on disk after a service is deployed -- or use environment variables.

This isn't practical at all in a mobile app -- users don't open files on disk and edit values or set environment variables. Does `appsettings.json` even make sense for a mobile app? Would you be better off hardcoding settings as a `const string`? If that is the case, we should just document how to do this and plug into the ASP.NET infrastructure so you just use C# `const` values."

Now to be really useful the logic needs to be a bit more complex. In contrast to API you can always use a missing value, e.g. `Call ((MyEnum)42))`, so a missing member is not critical (as much as other things) since it's not blocking (just annoying). Also adding them later is not a breaking change...

The most important thing for enum members is their values, e.g. if we have `MissingMember = 43` while the right value is `42`. That's very hard to diagnose such errors (and easy to get wrong since, most of the time, the values are assigned automatically by the C# compiler). It's also a breaking change to fix them."

I /think/ that slot 0 in ex_data is pre-wired to know that it's storing an `SSL*`, so if we called `SSL_dup` on this `SSL*` then as part of duplicating the EX_DATA portion it'll call `SSL_dup` on the value stored in this slot... which is bad if it's a GCHandle.

It might be OK to use slot 13 (CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_APP), but I'm not sure.  Every usage of this that I see within OpenSSL code always calls `SSL_get_ex_new_index` first, to associate an allocator/deallocator/duplicator with what is going to go into the slot.  Then they get back a number and need to remember that as their slot ID.

"Yeah, as stated in the meeting I do think this is not a reasonable new error in a quite old test (and was dealt with in the prior iteration of this change), and this can be somewhat easily avoided by using the old behavior for named function expressions (which are generally only used when you want recursive references like this anyhow). A self-call witnessing the unwidened type is _very_ odd, given our widening rules (no exterior calls can witness the unwidened type). I think this can manifest in even _stranger_ behavior if you do something with the `bar` reference rather than just call it - like pass it into a function desiring a callback, eg `handle(bar)` where `declare function handle(a: () => [any]): void`, or worse yet `declare function handle<T>(a: T): T` where the unwidened type will simply propagate via inference - where then you'll get this widening error so far removed from anything that it's relevant to that it's quite clear something's gone wrong."
"The private exception purposefully has a different full name (since it is nested). So we would need to check 2 different ""full names"".

Even full names wouldn't prevent some other code running in a Host ""Build()"" sequence naming their exception `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.HostAbortedException`. So it isn't a guaranteed solution either.

If, for some reason, someone else names their exception `HostAbortedException`, and it isn't the one we threw below, the caller will get `null` back from `HostFactoryResolver.ResolveServiceProviderFactory`, and it will handle it just like any other case where the IServiceProvider can't be found (usually displaying a message to the user saying something went wrong)."
"There are two main reasons for some of this weird ""handlings"", but it doesn't excuse most of them:
* Cecil's reference->definition resolution returns null if the resolution fails (missing assembly dependency, wrong dependency, ...). So unlike in NativeAOT's type system, there are potentially lot of places where null can appear unfortunately.
* Historically we've seen quite a few cases where weird IL/metadata we never anticipated (like obfuscated code) crashed the linker. While I agree it's easy to diagnose the problem, there's typically absolutely no workaround for the user (other than disabling trimming which in Blazor/Xamarin scenarios is not really viable).

We are guilty of adding `?.` and similar in places where we couldn't immediately reason about the input being null or not. This is exaggerated by the fact that we turned on nullable reference types (which was a good thing as it found several issues), but Cecil is not annotated, so everything looks nullable (even if in really it might not be)."

"I have no concern with the comments.  My concern is with calling task.Wait.  That is innapropriate and we should simply 'await' here to get the right behavior.  By calling 'Wait' we now have to deal with audting this code every time we go through looking for blocking calls in async methods.  .Wait in an async context is traditionally a large red flag that something is wrong.  That auditing will waste time and make this code different for no valuable reason. 

The appropriate thing to do here is to just 'await' the task like we would in pretty much all other code.  

Now, personally, that code is clear enough that it should need no comment.  But i have no problem with the code calling out why it does `await task.ConfigureAwait(false)` rather than just `task.Result`.

My reasoning is that since we cannot provide the ""right"" exception, because we cannot allocate it, giving OOM would be fairly truthful - we are in a state where we cannot function normally because of memory shortage.

User can try handle the situation by trimming memory use or at least will see OOM in Watson/dump and have a bit more info about environment at the time of the crash.

Wrong manual updating of assembly version has led to lot of problems for the upstack repo. This change automatically applies the versioning rules and calculates the assembly version

- No package project -> no change in assembly version & package version.
- Package project Exists -> always increment the package version.
- Package project Exists and part of any shared framework -> assembly version increment for netfx assets only
- Package project Exists and not part of any shared framework -> assembly version increment for all assets
- Baseline version is updated everytime so we done need to update the assemblyPackage version  table.
- Stable version and list of packages to be build should be updated everytime. 


Validation
Manually verified all the servicing packages for the assembly version changes being correctly produced.

It seems like ordering of the additionalCertificates X509Certificate2Collection is not quite predicable as I assumed. 
With that the validation callback can get wrong certificate and/or incomplete chain. 

With this change we would always get peer certificate from PlatformCertificateHandle and we would add all extra certificates to ChainPolicy.ExtraStore. That may contain peer certificate it self but it does not matter as that is just hint and chain.Build will create the chain as needed. 

I aslo added ITestOutputHelper to the test so it is easier to collect useful information on test failures.

"I think I'm going to close this until after .NET 6 peels off of main, and likewise not pursue moving ECC fully to EVP_PKEY in this release (ECC was giving me some trouble, anyways).

When running this change with OpenSSL 3.0 the DSA tests which try to export a public key with private parameters fail with an OutOfMemoryException.  Why? Well, because the (mostly generated) code walks down a path, does `ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_PROV, ERR_R_NOT_A_PRIVATE_KEY)` (the error we want), then down an error handling path goes ""oh, building that interior piece failed, clearly we're out of memory `ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_PROV, ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE)` (not the error we want), and then no other error happened.  So we exit CryptoNative_GetPkcs8PrivateKeySize with an error stack of `{ LIB_PROV|NOT_A_PRIVATE_KEY, LIB_PROV|MALLOC_FAILURE }`.  Our logic is to take the last (newest) error, and if it's MALLOC_FAILURE that we report an OutOfMemoryException.

Trying to rewind my brain 5 years, I'm pretty sure we take the last error because of all the places that we decide there was an error and we move on anyways without clearing it, and this was partly because of the expense of interacting with the error state in OpenSSL 0.9.8 and 1.0.x (with 1.1.0 (IIRC) it moved to a thread-local thing and got much less costly).  What this error shows is that we're just out of touch and need to rethink exception processing for OpenSSL.

I /think/ that what we want is:

* ERR_clear_error() at the start of each operation.
* Change our current ""keep asking what the error is until we run out"" to something like `long CryptoNative_GetErrorForException(out int handlerFlags)` ((HandlerFlag)0x01 being ""OutOfMemoryException""), which takes the **oldest** and clears the error queue, the logic being that the first thing that went wrong since we started is obviously ""the thing that went wrong"".  (Maybe there'll be edge cases that say this also isn't always the right answer, though... but I hope not)

Because this is a pretty fundamental change in how we're interopping I think we want to make sure there's a chance to see if something complicated goes wrong, which means we want it in a preview release we can get good feedback on.  And that means it's probably .NET 7 Preview 1.

---

The alternative is that we just say ""eh, let's only throw OOM if that was the oldest error in the queue"", but that feels like we're just missing the point and kicking the can a bit.

"The host has some code in it which detects arm64 hardware and changes behavior slightly based on that. So it actually does make a difference if it's running on arm64 or x64 hardware. And since the host tests do weird things with the host, I would not be surprised if this has an effect. Especially if the global install is 5.0 only which is not arm64 aware (which is BTW another problem with this setup) - after 6.0 GA we will also release an update to 5.0 which will be arm64 aware. In fact I think we will block installing 5.0 SDK on arm64 hardware (only runtime will be OK, but it installs into a different location), but I could be wrong.

Another problem will be that these images have .NET 2.1 SDK on them - those are out of support and are absolutely not supported on arm64 macs - we will have updated 3.1 and 5.0 installers, but AFAIK there are no plans to update the 2.1 installers. So trying to install the 2.1 on arm64 hardware will effectively break all .NET installs after the GA refresh.

## Customer Impact

This PR actually fixes two bugs.

The first one is a bug reported by customer via email, where an async read operation performed on a `FileStream` opened for **non-seekable device** file was throwing an `System.IO.IOException`: ""The parameter is incorrect"".

It turns out that `ReadFile` [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile#parameters) was wrong:

> For an hFile that does not support byte offsets, Offset and OffsetHigh are ignored.

And `OVERLAPPED` [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped#members) was right:

> This member is nonzero only when performing I/O requests on a seeking device that supports the concept of an offset (also referred to as a file pointer mechanism), such as a file. Otherwise, this member **must be zero**.

The second bug is #58383. To tell the long story short, `File.ReadAllBytes*(string path, ...)` methods were assuming that `path` can't point to a non-seekable file like named pipe.

## Testing

The fix was verified using tests added in the PR. It has been in main for a month (#58434) and we have already been doing that for sync file handles (the issue was originally discovered and fixed by @github):

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/cf7d5173d4d9ce0aac8212e78063a097e1f57c0a/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/RandomAccess.Windows.cs#L723-L732

## Risk

Very low. :shipit:

"> Why are you setting `%NUGET_PACKAGES%`?

...though to a large extent, this is a pointless question and shouldn't actually *matter*; it's a documented environment variable, with documented semantics, and the xamarin-android build *should not break* ""just because"" this value is set (""within reason"", poorly defined).

A ""spit-balled"" solution is to update `Configuration.props` with:

```xml
<XAPackagesDir Condition="" '$(XAPackagesDir)' == '' And '$(NUGET_PACKAGES)' != '' "">$(NUGET_PACKAGES)</XAPackagesDir>
<XAPackagesDir Condition="" '$(XAPackagesDir)' == '' And '$(OS)' == 'Windows' "">$(userprofile)\.nuget\packages</XAPackagesDir>
<XAPackagesDir Condition="" '$(XAPackagesDir)' == '' And '$(OS)' != 'Windows' "">$(HOME)/.nuget/packages</XAPackagesDir>
```

Then use `$(XAPackagesDir)` instead of hardcoding `$(XamarinAndroidSourcePath)\packages`.

Which works with 2 seconds thought, but...  If someone then edits `NuGet.config` to override `globalPackagesFolder`, things will break (differently), as `$(XAPackagesDir)` won't match the `globalPackagesFolder` within `NuGet.config`.

😞

A slightly different take might be to use:

```xml
<XAPackagesDir Condition="" '$(XAPackagesDir)' == '' And '$(NUGET_PACKAGES)' != '' "">$(NUGET_PACKAGES)</XAPackagesDir>
<XAPackagesDir Condition="" '$(XAPackagesDir)' == '' >$(XamarinAndroidSourcePath)\packages</XAPackagesDir>
```

and continue to rely on the `globalPackagesFolder` value, though this approach still doesn't deal well with `NuGet.config` changes without corresponding build system changes, e.g. updating the `CheckApiCompatibility.ApiCompatPath` property value, which just feels ""wrong""."

In this crazy new world, profile generators would make profiles available to the user, but we would neither (1) automatically put them in the user's ""resultant set of profiles"" nor (2) hide them once we put them there.

In general, and I am happy to be disabused of this notion, we consider `profiles.list` to be _the user's property._ Anything we put in there, we have given them, and cannot take back or later change. Even the `hidden` ones. That's the only model we have today for generated profiles!

If we change the model to make those profiles available, but we do not automatically promote them (put them in the user's possession) and instead give them the option to do so... we can have a nearly infinite number of profile generators--we could even rename them to ""detectors"" or whatever--that the user could opt in for."

Agree with this being a fragile design. It predates me, it existed for several years and apparently it worked just fine. Even though this is hard to get right without understanding RID compatibility rules, it's the closest / best implementation based on the rid graph.

> Transform all net461 configs to instead be net461-windows, that way all configurations are referencing the right live libs.

Reason why we didn't do this yet is because of these two major downsides:
- Making a tfm rid specific without also building a rid agnostic tfm of the same TargetFrameworkIdentifier results in  packages having duplicated assets in the i.e. lib/net461/ and runtimes/win/lib/net461/ folders.

- net461-windows is a tfm alias that nuget doesn't understand and the `-windows` part needs to be stripped from the target framework alias: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/761d2e6545a31d2ebf9cb60443ed2a9c2f8268b5/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.TargetFramework.Sdk/src/build/Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.TargetFramework.Sdk.props#L21-L22. Adding the `-windows` rid to every .NETFramework tfm results in this hack being applied in many more places and more NuGet.config files being necessary to disable VS's restore which can't handle restoring them: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/c94b75f662030a09c8747d79a16d9f4f2c9d44f1/src/libraries/System.Data.OleDb/NuGet.config#L2.

> Add some build checks that check P2Ps when building netfx libs, and ensuring that we are not incorrectly getting a NS2.0 asset when the P2P also has a net461-windows asset.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the [ProjectReference protocol](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/ProjectReference-Protocol.md) doesn't expose the necessary information to implement such a check. Of course you could always implement custom targets and MSBuild calls but that won't work with static graph build which we want to leverage."

 I understand that, perhaps, the likelihood to find a method that is still ""bad"" is extremely low for these helpers, but it is better to always perform full validation. One of the reasons is the fact that code is often copied for other helpers and between compiler layers.

"There's something a little bit backwards here - we are leveraging a bunch of the logic of signature help, which I'm pretty sure gives us the wrong `argumentCount` because it has to account for signature help for when a user is in the last position of a signature and you intend to add an argument; but because of that, we have to then re-adjust the argument count. So we're just hacking on the hack of signature help.

I would love to separate completions logic out from `SignatureHelp` more, but I'd rather not see the full refactor in this PR. It seems like the adjustment should actually happen in `signatureHelp.ts` - specifically in `getArgumentInfoForCompletions` (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/1fe9bfdd0ee0ecf9dff23a40c0066645719e46b9/src/services/signatureHelp.ts#L166)."

"> The buggy behavior occurred when there was no semantic classification or diagnostic request to trigger the flush of the old LS - instead, if we got an inlay hint request followed by an update, followed by another inlay hint request, the second inlay hint request would _not_ cause an LS synchronization to occur, and would instead reuse the LS from the first request verbatim.

There's something I still don't totally understand. Given the scenario where the editor

1. requests inlay hints
2. sends updates
3. requests inlay hints
4. requests errors

I understand that why the inlay hints might get skewed, but the entire text state for errors was off too - in a way that would imply the whole file was corrupted. So:

1. Why didn't `geterr` immediately force the old LS out?
2. What is it about a subsequent `updateOpen` (and maybe some other semantic operations) that enabled us to recover?

Every time I think that I understand what's going wrong, there's other architectural questions I have. For example, maybe it's not that the document itself is corrupted, it's just the line maps. I can understand that, but if it's just the line maps, why does that affect the checker's view of the file content (as opposed to the ranges on which it's reporting)? I can imagine that the line maps are used to construct the document for the LS, but then arguably the document text must be inaccurate in a way that's hard to recover from.

"You and I get very different numbers.  How exactly are you building System.Private.Xml.dll with these changes and then running the benchmarks? Regardless, I deterministically see the TryWrite version as being at least 10% faster than what's currently in main, not slower as your numbers suggest.  This is exactly the kind of scenario TryWriter is geared towards, enabling devs to write the simple thing and let the system generate the optimal set of calls under the covers.  So I want anything that should be using to use it rather than trying to work around any perceived current perf limitations by open-coding a replacement; then when TryWrite improves, so too does all the code using it... we improve the primitive implementations, and everyone benefits.  The code is also simpler, very clearly expressing the intent of what should be written.

If this were a super hot path, then yeah, it might be worth an exception to eek out a few more cycles of savings.  But we're talking about an API that's already a corner-case, used fairly rarely, a very small percentage of time, and then within that we're talking about a small percentage of that small percentage of possible improvement in open-coding the solution vs just doing the simple thing with TryWrite.  I would be very surprised if you were able to measure the impact of that difference on your 10-50GB workload; I'd welcome you trying it out and sharing the profiles that prove me wrong.

fgMorphModToSubMulDiv tries to check if it is ok to ""clone"" locals
instead of spilling them by checking for address exposure. This was
necessary because GTF_GLOB_REF is not up-to-date in preorder during
morph, which is when this runs. However, address exposure is not valid
for implicit byrefs at this point, so the check is not enough.

The logic is trying to figure out which of the operands need to be
spilled and which of them can be cloned. However, the logic was also
wrong in the face of potential embedded assignments. Thus, rework it to
check interference on its own.

As part of this, remove fgIsSafeToClone and make fgMakeMultiUse less
conservative by avoiding checking for address exposure. This was
probably an attempt at some limited interference checks, but other uses do
not seem to need this.

"This pattern of having a static `CreateDefaultDispatcher` plus an optional constructor param seems unusual to me, so I'd be interested to understand the goals.

> Correct me if I'm wrong, but would the change be made here?:

Yes, the point where the layout for both editor and title widget starts is this:

https://github.com/SneakyFish5/vscode/blob/c1905a3d139ea803c8f46ffc6535e9abdfcb1b60/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/editor/editorGroupView.ts#L1702-L1702

As I already said, wouldn't this layout algorithm make more sense:
* editor group view layout gets called with the size it can consume
* editor title layout is called with that dimension and returns the actual width/height it consumes based on some rules
  * if multi line tabs are disabled, it just returns with `35px` (as today)
  * if multi-line tabs are enabled but the resulting editor size is below min width, it just returns with `35px` (see note below)
  * otherwise it returns with the exact height it consumed based on `offsetHeight`
* editor group uses the title height to pass on to the editor control
* layout is done

**Note:** maybe instead of the title control having hardcoded knowledge about the minimum size of the editor, it could rather accept the actual dimensions + the max dimensions it can consume. That way, the editor group view layout call can pass both the dimension and the max dimension into the title control. 

I suggest for now we ignore the other feedback I gave about `redraw` calling `relayout`, I think this needs additional thoughts how to get right. Let's first focus on the layout algorithm from editor group to editor title.

"> I modified deepFreeze to support an exclusion list. I then used this at the event location to exclude freezing the outputs.

Not a fan of that tbh - `deepFreeze` is ""deep"" and a flat list of key is always ambiguous in that context. Maybe my earlier suggestion was misleading. I like two things from this PR

1. improve `deepFreeze` to always ignore typed arrays because it is apparently illegal to freeze them. 
1. don't use `deepFreeze` when emitting the notebook change event.

It's possibly I'm just looking at it wrong, but my initial impression was that your PR was making things worse than they were before. If I output the character `א` followed the character `ב`, then I expect to see `א` in column 1 and `ב` in column 2. 

This is my test case:

    printf ""א""; sleep 1; printf ""ב""; printf ""\n""

"> @github, @github, @github, I'm curious about the confused emoji you selected. Is that about the `!!` feature itself? About dotnet/runtime using it? About something else? Thanks for any feedback.

Hi! Yes, my reaction refers to the feature itself.
I have three concerns:
1. It seems to me that this reduces the readability of the code and increases the entry threshold. Instead of self-documenting attributes like [NotNull], we introduce additional language tokens, the purpose of which can only be understood from the documentation. It's like managed pointers `^`, it's like the first step towards getting closer to the C++ syntax, which has raised a lot of questions about the difference between `const char*` and `char const *`. `!!` matter - we must pay attention to them. But at the same time, these are only two characters - we will have to focus on each argument, looking for them. The difference from the `[ThrowIfNull]` attribute is only in length. So we slightly help those who will edit a method that uses NotNull arguments, but complicate life for those who use this method. 
2. It seems to me that instead of modifying the compiler, we delegate its task to the programmer. Thanks to non-nullable reference types, the compiler knows exactly which arguments can be null and which can't. If we don't want to validate arguments in the code, then let's not and let the compiler provide Fail Fast! for us.
3. I think this is a step in the wrong direction. Besides to checking for null, we have other checks for: empty string, empty collection, undefined Enum element, out of range, null element in collection, etc. All these checks will remain in the body of method. As a result, the probability of error will increase, since now both the one who edits the method and the one who uses it need to look for checks in two places. And the solutions for the cases described above cannot be written so simply as `!!` It seems to me that it would be more correct to concentrate on the ability to generate code based on attributes and increase the flexibility of the attributes, which would allow us to get AoP for all cases. "
"There might be a bug in something somewhere that causes some issues in some scenarios. Sometimes some builds couldn't load a task or loaded the wrong one. This seemed to fix it 😆

"> but my question is why? 

Because i would really prefer to not have code that does stuff that is not necessary.  *Especially* at this layer.  I've tried to make it very precise and work very correctly with the documented sqlite API.  When we do things taht are unnecessary, it just makes things more confusing IMO because either it will convey the wrong thing to the reader (i.e. that the transaction is necessary), or it will have comments on it saying things like ""we don't actually need this, but we're doing it"", and eventually we'll be at a point where people will say ""i don't want to even touch this because i'm nt sure if it will be a problem""

>  is there an issue having transaction outside covering everything? 

Let me ask you this question:  do you place a `lock (something)` around all assignments in code?  Or do you just use that (and other synchronizations mechanisms) when appropriate because you actually have shared date and/or races to contend with?  

>  transaction seems too fragile and easy to get wrong.

"> I feel like this is an argument to avoid using built-in members entirely in nullable tests and that is a fairly onerous ask.

The majority of tests in this class use the `CreateNullableCompilation` helper to run analysis. That uses either the `netstandard2.0` or the `net451` reference assemblies hence all of the built-in members are oblivious. If the intent is to test oblivious then that works. My suspicion is though that in most cases the intent is not to test oblivious. Perhaps I'm wrong here though. 

> A more reasonable ask would be perhaps to verify what are the annotations on ref assemblies that are used in our nullable tests in practice

The answer to this depends on the test. If the test uses the `netstandard2.0` reference assemblies then there is one answer, if it uses `netcoreapp3.1` then there is a different answer. Basically it is subject to some degree of change. Generally that the API will get stronger though which is a ""safe"" change from this perspective. 

Consider this specific case though: the test here is using the `netstandard2.0` reference assemblies which means this is validating that `string~` can assign here. Was that the intent? Reading the test I thought the intent was to check what happened when either `string?` or `string!` was the source of the assignment. Am I just reading the intent of this test wrong (or reading the setup code wrong)?

> I'm a little resistant to the idea that we need to account for it here because it is going to need to be accounted for en masse.

I'm not suggesting we go back and rewrite all the tests. At the same time seems like something we could avoid going forward with new ones. 

> A more reasonable ask would be perhaps to verify what are the annotations on ref assemblies that are used in our nullable tests in practice, and ensure that the annotations on ref assemblies for tests do not change accidentally

The model we try to operate on is that we keep pushing the `.NET Core App` reference assemblies forward. Observe that while we have `netcoreapp3.1` assemblies we don't have `netcoreapp3.0` or `netcoreapp2.1`. That's because we're always effectively on latest. The API sets which are stable are `netstandard2.0`, `net451`, etc ...

No. Lack of availability attributes means it's been available since our earliest supported versions.
E.g. lack of `[NoWatch]` implies it's `[Watch (2,0)]` and that the API has been available in the past 6 years (or so)

This is almost always wrong when adding bindings for a new Xcode (unless it added a new platform).

> Since it's a breaking change to remove things, and it's always easier to introduce things later on?

True :-) However it's true for code that we ship (post generation), not the binding sources!

Example:  `[NoWatch]` -> means we're not generating the API on watchOS.

If you don't _add_ `[NoWatch]` (in binding sources) then the API will be present inside `Xamarin.WatchOS.dll` (and assumed to be available since 2.0 which is watchOS minimum supported version).

If you want to fix that later, by adding `[NoWatch]`, then you are creating a **breaking change** (since the API won't be part of `Xamarin.WatchOS.dll` in the next release).

"Hey Jared, see the above convo with Matt/Tomas.  My personal main objection over having this be `object` is that it gets _super_ easy to accidentally use the wrong value as the compiler/language gives you zero type safety.  For example, there is code that looks like this in this pr:  `base(..., id: reference.Id)`.  If the 'id' were typed as `object`, it would have been trivial to accidently mistype that as:  `base(..., id: reference)` instead.  In that case the compiler would have given me no information that i did anything wrong.  However, because it is typed as MetadataId, i must provide an actual value typed that way.

Similarly, in the code that consumes this later, i have a `ConditionalWeakTable<MetadataId, ...>`.  In this form the compiler ensures that i'm looking up/storing with actual MetadataIds.  If it were typed as object it would have been trivial to accidently write `map.GetOrAdd(ref.GetMetadata(), ...)` instead of `map.GetOrAdd(ref.GetMetadata().Id, ...)`.

So, in other words, even though it is an empty type, it still provides real type safety in the code.  Something i would like to keep around.  

So personally, i would like it to be typed.  It reduces the chance of errors.  And, if we want to add state to it (perhaps for debugging purposes), now it is trivial to do so.

"@github Was there an issue discussing this feature that I'm not seeing?

Personally, I'm not sure that I like the idea of changing the claim processor at this point to have knowledge of some particular JSON-ims, and there are degenerate cases where things can go wrong.  Consider, for the sake of discussion, an identity provider that has two distinct claim values, `[""a""]` and `a`.

```C#
// Does anyone know why Fabrikam Identity uses such bad role names?
bool isAuditor = id.HasClaim(""[\""a\""]"");
bool isAdministrator = id.HasClaim(""a"");
```

In this degenerate case, an identity with the claim of `[\""a\""]` is now automatically both an auditor (String.Equals) and an administrator (String.Equals on the processed first array element).   This would break the security model, resulting in an elevation of privilege.

Adding special ""some identities use JSON arrays"" support now invites that other formats would be added later (and that no format can ever be taken away).  Combined with the fact that this type lives in the shared runtime, it means that any library using claims and using .NET Standard 2.0 couldn't really reason about whether their HasClaim is going to work or not.  (They'd have to target specific versions of .NET to indicate the minimum runtime behaviors they want for the same API).

---

All in all, I think that a better answer would be to make a new type (which extends ClaimsIdentity to override HasClaim) so that there's explicit opt-in (at some level) to this behavior.  It probably wants to be in a different library than System.Security.Claims, so that it doesn't leave a perpetual dependency on JSON.  And I'm not really sure that it even belongs in dotnet/runtime (it seems to mesh more with the JWT stuff, which is in a different repository... but maybe there's room for a new System.Security.Claims.Json package built out of dotnet/runtime)."
"> It will always be NULL the way it is being used.

...

> Hmm, not sure if this works for PSS / OAEP.

Yeah, it's really these two together that are why I made the local_ as complex as the real thing.

The local_ only checks for EVP_PKEY_RSA because it uses `base_id`, which turns `EVP_PKEY_RSA_PSS` into `EVP_PKEY_RSA`.  I think the purpose of the sidecar routine here was ""ugh, we have two different IDs for ""RSA"" and we keep getting the ""or"" wrong, so let's put them in one place"".  At least... that's the only reason I can figure out that they added it.

Yeah, in the generate flow the pkey is always NULL (which makes me wonder why they routed EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_keygen_bits through it at all).

1.0.2: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/12ad22dd16ffe47f8cde3cddb84a160e8cdb3e30/crypto/rsa/rsa.h#L256-L258

# define EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_keygen_bits(ctx, bits) \
        EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl(ctx, EVP_PKEY_RSA, EVP_PKEY_OP_KEYGEN, \
                                EVP_PKEY_CTRL_RSA_KEYGEN_BITS, bits, NULL)
```

1.1.1: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/081a7061f3da07318c4b0f5de67b82285630bf6b/include/openssl/rsa.h#L121-L123

                          EVP_PKEY_CTRL_RSA_KEYGEN_BITS, bits, NULL)
```

Looks like in 3.0 it's a function in its own right, but I believe the EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl route (with or without going through RSA_pkey_ctx_ctrl) will still work.

"I haven't read through the comments here yet, but just taking a look as someone who spends a fair amount of time in the csproj files...

At a high-level, the change seems ok.  Some csprojs will get an extra few lines they don't already have, and conditions like `Condition="" '$(TargetsOSX)' == 'true'""` change to conditions like `Condition="" '$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'OSX'""`.  Ok.

I'm more concerned that some such conditions are more confusing and much more likely to lead to user error that's hard for us to understand and debug, and we'll end up with devs spinning their wheels trying to figure out what's gone wrong.  For example, one line changes this very obvious statement:
`<ItemGroup Condition="" '$(TargetsUnix)' == 'true'"">`
which is pretty obvious in meaning, to:
`<ItemGroup Condition=""'$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' != '' and '$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' != 'windows'"">`
which, at least to me, is not at all obvious.  I fully expect folks will get that conversion wrong.  And there's obviously a subtly I don't understand, because elsewhere this:
`Condition=""'$(TargetsUnix)' == 'true' or '$(TargetsBrowser)' == 'true'""`
is replaced by this:
`Condition=""'$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'Unix' or '$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'Browser'""`
Why is Unix usable in one TargetsUnix case and not the other?  Why are we checking for empty identifiers?  Etc.  To make this usable, that will need to be simplified.

Changes like this one are also harder to understand (at least for me) without digging in further to what's going on:

After: `<ItemGroup Condition=""'$(GeneratePlatformNotSupportedAssemblyMessage)' == ''"">`

"The assembly is listed in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/libraries/NetCoreAppLibrary.props; and my understanding is that the shared runtime will get the $(NetCoreAppCurrent) build instead of the netstandard2.0 build, which means it will reference System.Runtime and friends instead of netstandard.dll, and therefore netstandard.dll won't be part of its own dependency chain.

I very well could be wrong about any or all of this :smile:."
"@github I'm not sure we want the labels to _look_ like input elements because that would give the wrong impression that they are interactive.

"I don't think so. Without `def`, `buildTimeLimit` is essentially a global variable, and so available within the method `addWrappers`. Without `def`, `buildTimeLimit` would only be available within its declaration scope.

Or at least, that's how I read the [StackOverflow article](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/184002/groovy-whats-the-purpose-of-def-in-def-x-0). I know hardly anything about groovy, so let me know if I'm wrong about this.

"I think it's fine; it's pretty conservative. Since we're going through like two calls and then checking _some_ overload is maybe OK (rather than doing overload resolution), and _not_ validating any argument types beyond the first (that's what #29818 does), choosing to only issue an error when we're absolutely sure something's wrong seems reasonable."
"In a sense, this is not wrong—`gen` could have its `next()` called with no arguments, making `a` `undefined` at runtime. But previously, this fell into a special case of ignoring that optionality for convenience.

Now, when we try to get the iteration types of `Generator<R, T, S> | AsyncGenerator<R, T, S>` as an async _iterable_, we get `noIterationTypes`, because the former doesn’t have a `[Symbol.asyncIterator]()` member. Instead, we fall back to getting the iteration types of this union as an async _iterator_, using its next/return/throw method signatures to determine `T`, `TReturn`, and `TNext`. Because we have a union signature, it doesn’t count as a reference to one of the global generator/iterator types, and so it doesn’t take the fast path that ignores the optionality. Instead, it correctly sees that the `next()` method can take no arguments or `[1]`, and so it infers the type `1 | undefined`.

More work could be done to make union signatures take the fast path that drops the optionality if every signature in the union is a reference to one of the global generator/iterator types, but I felt like this was getting fairly complex for limited utility—the results it produces with less complexity are strictly more correct given the limitations we have for modeling this."
"So for example:
`v >= int.MinValue ` generates a tree that is equal to `return (v < int.MinValue) == false`
`int.MinValue <= v` generates a tree that is equal to `return (int.MinValue > v) == false`
However in case of ulong/uint:
`v <= ulong.MaxValue` generates a tree that is equal to `return (v > -1) == false
`ulong.MaxValue >= v` generates a tree that is equal to `return (-1 < v) == false
These trees look odd to me because (v > -1) is going to be always true.
Correct me please if I'm wrong.

Famously the csc task [does not work with older versions of MSBuild](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/40129). It seems like we may be guiding users down the wrong path by not taking dependencies on newer versions of MSBuild if that allows them to get into a state where the msbuild they use (and therefore the compiler) is older than the language features they may want to use."
"> Any other feedback here?

So for the single element versions of `vst1` and `vld1` intrinsics we never generate `ST1` and `LD1` on little-endian. There we always generate `str` and `ldr` since they provide more addressing modes.

e.g.

```
#include <arm_neon.h>

void foo (int32x4_t v, int32_t *a)
{
  return vst1q_s32 (a, v);
}
```

will generate a `str     q0, [x0]`

For big-endian we do generate the `ST1` and `LD1` though.  This is not to say that this patch is wrong or needs changing. but just a headsup that you have less flexibility. and the single structure single reg intrinsics are the most common ones."

"> Even Maui?

I have not seen much done to make Maui trimming safe by construction. https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/355 that tracks the work does not have a lot of traffic. For .NET 6, I assume that Maui will be on trim and hope for the best plan that Xamarin apps have been on historically.

Correct me if my conjecture is wrong and we have plan in place to make maui trimming safe by construction for .NET 6.

We have done good work on making core libraries annotated for trimming in .NET 6. We have run out of time to address the trimming issues in the app models where I think M.E.DependencyInjection injection belongs. Another issue in the same bucket are issues with integration of source generated json serializers in ASP.NET that prevent ASP.NET webservices from being provably trimming safe by default. It will be something to focus on .NET 7. I expect that it will need work from multiple teams to address successfully (appmodel teams, runtime teams, language).

"> I wonder, if the condition for having an empty span is so specific, why the failure is not easily reproducible? And how does `memLevel` affect that?

The memory level for the deflater represents how much memory it is allowed to use internally before flushing to `output` buffer. Larger memory, better performance and better compression ratios - the classic trade-off between speed and memory. The default is 8, which in turn means that the deflater is allowed to allocate up to 2^8 KB of memory.

So for example, if we try to deflate 10_000 bytes of data in a single deflate call, it deflater in most cases will not produce any output unless we explicitly say we want it to. In our case it is essential to avoid flushing and only flush when we're done deflating.

However there might be cases when the deflater has reached some limit in its internal buffer and will flush bytes. It might even flush as many bytes as we've given it opportunity to. My original assumption was that the deflater will always return `ErrorCode.BufError` when the provided buffer is full and internally there is more outstanding data, but because we're not explicitly specifying that we're flushing, I guess my assumption is wrong.

This is why working with `memLevel` 1 = 2KB internal memory is easier to reproduce the error - I can craft messages, more easily, that would exhaust its internal memory and cause it to flush.

I hope this makes sense, let me know if I can help further.

"Last commit fixed a subtle bug.

When we devirtualize a tail call we might fail to recognize that the tail call is now a recursive tail call, because we are checking the wrong method handle. For normal methods this just means we may not mark the block range as a loop (which is bad but rarely leads to bugs). But for OSR methods this is fatal because they need to use this to trigger importation of the method entry.

One method where this happens is `System.Xml.Serialization.StructMapping:System.Xml.Serialization.INameScope.get_Item(System.String,System.String):System.Object:this` from the xml serialization libraries tests (under random OSR stress, we put a patchpoint at offset 0x1b).

Are we worried we can overflow `int`? I can bump count to `long` or `ulong`. This is no longer ""the answer"" but more so the upper guess. The actual answer comes from walking the structures and counting entries we like. "
"@github I'm pretty sure the fix here is to just change the call to this

```C#
bool PageIsInThisContext(IView page)
{
	var platformView = page.ToPlatform();
```

It's passing the wrong `MauiContext` into `ToPlatform` there which causes the `Page` to recreate the handler. That page already has a handler so `ToPlatform` will just return it if you don't pass in a `MauiContext`

I'm not too sure why this broke in `p14`. The `MauiContext` has been passed into the code since we created `AlertManager`. I'm guessing the work we did to rewrite these extensions made it so two wrongs no longer were making a right"
"Wait wait wait... This PR looks wrong. I never committed to 2.1 (only 2.2). This PR seems to have picked up a few commits from 2.2.

Btw I think the instructions for updating this pull request need to be fixed. I think the last line should be a force push."
"If this is being done here, are there also updates to the `EnsureInitialized` method above? Seems wrong that it also calls `Interop.GetBaseUri`.

Overall, the initialization flow starts to seem a bit complicated as there's more than one code path that calls these initialization methods. If there any way to consolidate this that would be good.

For example, it's not clear to me why the `InitializeNavigationManager` method now exists in `WebAssemblyHostBuilder`. Since the only thing it does is use synchronous interop to fetch its config from the JS side, would it work more simply to have a regular constructor on `WebAssemblyNavigationManager` that takes a `WebAssemblyJSRuntimeInvoker` and provides its own initialization logic? If so, the `EnsureInitialized` override could be removed, and we wouldn't need this `InitializeWithParameters` method. The whole flow would then be much more understandable.

I haven't really thought through all the details so maybe there are reasons it has to work like it does, but just want to check."
"Just a thought, which I don't mind whether you do anything with or not :) Instead of having multiple checks for `isWebAssembly` that run each time there are calls, an alternative would be changing the static constructor so that the static `_renderers` dictionary doesn't even get instantiated in non-wasm cases.

Then there would be no need to check `isWebAssembly` in each of these methods - they would just nullref if they were called on the wrong platform (and they never should be called like this - it could only happen if we introduced a bug since it's `internal` anyway - so a nullref is a reasonable level of error handling).

Additionally, if we add more methods that access `_renderers` in the future, we wouldn't have to remember to add an `isWebAssembly` check."
Oh I thought that was only for flaky tests. Not for surely failing tests due to path issues. But I could be wrong. @github?
"I might be wrong here, but if we were to support multi-threading we would still be single threaded on the UI, since changing that would be a massive breaking change of epic proportions. We would likely switch to use a synchronization context in the same way we do on the server."
This is problematic. For normal file-based assembly `C:\temp\MyApp.dll` the `assemblyDirectory` will end up `C:\temp`. But for single-file in `C:\temp\MyApp.exe` the `assemblyDirectory` will end up as `C:\` - very likely wrong.
"Yes; I had a source generator for the IHeaderDictionary (how I originally generated them); but the CI rejected it as a used project that wasn't in the shipped API, which seemed to be going wrong since it was just internal and not to be shipped.

Could automate it as part of the Kestrel code generator (so only need to add to HeaderNames); however that would need an attribute on some of the headers (e.g. `DNT`) to say don't add them (Obselete may work or may be too strong; since it also has `Path`,`Scheme`, `Method` etc.)"
This feels like the wrong place to do the normalization (assuming it is needed)?
"This seems wrong, if you can't find a TryParse method then the next binder should be called. Or probably more accurately, the TryParseModelBinderProvider shouldn't create a Binder if no TryParse method is found."

"> anyway, what it is doing here not much different than what others are doing. so fine if you want to update all those to whatever design you think better.

This feedback is about this particular change.  I think it would be worthwhile as there is already a lot of complexity here, and it seems more difficult than necessary to establish if the code is doing things correctly.  A simple refactoring here makes the code clearer and less difficult to get wrong.  Thanks!

>  also, that just change what needs to be considered like now one must know that return valued must be logged by all callers.

Yes.  That's the point :)  Now the language and compiler force you to think about that side of things.  That's a good thing :)  It means that if someone comes in and adds/changes any flow control, they're forced to consider the telemetry implications.

> anyway, what it is doing here not much different than what others are doing.

Lots of code follows the caller/callee pattern to ensure that the code doesn't need all control flow paths to be annotated.  Several other PRs in the last month got this exact feedback to make things clearer.  Thanks! :)"

">  Anyway, I think I need to check my solution because I noticed one issue. Spacing is calculated correctly but items on the edges have incorrect size. For example, items in first and last columns of vertical grid with 3 and more than spans will have different width than ones in inner columns

@github @github I think I see why this is happening - the `GetItemOffsets` method is using `GetChildAdapterPosition(view)` to determine an index for the item. But the index also depends on whether there are header/footer items, so with a header in place the index is off by one and the offsets for the items on the edges are calculated wrong.

I think I see how we can fix this; the SpacingItemDecoration will need to have the SpanSizeLookup item passed in from the ItemsViewRenderer; the SpanSizeLookup. I'll implement that in the morning and see if we can fix this issue. "

"The way I understand the AIDL dokumentation is that multidimensional arrays like `int[][]` are not supported. At the moment the `CSharpCodeGenerator` or maybe the `AidlParser` just ignores higher dimensions and int[][] is treated like int[]. However throwing some NotSupportedException might not be wrong.

For `List` I think - but not 100% sure - you can put any supported object in. And one object can be a List which can contain other Lists and so on. I don't know why (maybe a bug) but the Android Studio does not support parametrization like `List<List<List<String>>>>`, just `List<String>`. So you can use `List` and put Lists in but `List<List>>` does not work!?

The CSharpCodeGenerator might not cover all cases for Lists correct and should definetely be unit tested also in this perspect."
"I just tested and I was wrong earlier, we do have scenarios already where we restore activities that are stopped:

It turns out we only ever hit AddHeaders code path for two things:
1) Adding in the DefaultRequestHeaders

For (2), the headers are all raw response headers, so in AddHeaders above, the `if (sourceValue is HeaderStoreItemInfo info)` check will always be false and we'll never hit this AddHeaderInfo path.

For (1), the headers are all forced to be in HeaderStoreItemInfo instances (something else to revisit), and we were only getting here after calling ParseRawHeaderValues, which for a custom header with no validation would basically transfer the raw value to the parsed field.

But I removed that ParseRawHeaderValues call, so now we may still have raw values here."

Advantages of these are that we dont have to worry about accidental wrong access on host. 
Eg right now session has `this.host.newLine` which with current change should have been `this.fsHost`

I think now `newLine` doesnt have to be on `fsHost` with this change. 
`useCaseSensitiveFileNames` should be on `fsHost` as its related to file system


```ts
/*@github*/
    export function getHosts(host: ServerHost, fsHost: FileServerHost | undefined): ServerHost {
        return !fsHost ?
            host :
            {
                setTimeout: host.setTimeout.bind(host),
                // Other methods from host to be bound
                useCaseSensitiveFileNames: fsHost.useCaseSensitiveFileNames;
                readFile: fsHost.readFile.bind(fsHost),
                // Other fsHost methods to be bound
            };
    }
```"
"Looking through the change, this looks like an extremely disruptive change. There will be many individual scripts (outside the repo) that need to be adjusted. It also seems to turn RID concepts into user-visible concepts, possibly unnecessarily. I always disliked the usage of ""Windows_NT"" (IMO, it should be ""Windows"" - we stopped saying ""NT"" like 20 years ago), and ""OSX"" should be ""macOS"". But using ""win"" everywhere that an OS name is required seems like overkill. Especially since ""win"" is an English word as well as a magic RID abbreviation meaning the Windows OS. Using ""win"" instead of ""Windows"" in non-RID contexts seems wrong. Is this whole change worth the trouble (and inevitable long tail fallout)?"

"This is awesome - I have been searching for a way to define such local JSX namespace for a while and wasn't aware that this is already implemented!

I've played a little bit with it and it seems to work pretty well - I only have one caveat with it: it doesn't support `/** @github jsx */` as it's not a member expression. Or at least I couldn't figure out how to make it work. As the whole thing only seems to work with namespaces anyway as you can't really put types onto runtime values - would it be possible to extend the support for it in a way that if a particular simple binding that is used as a pragma is imported from a module then this would check if the module itself exports `JSX`? I might be wrong - but the change seems quite logical and shouldn't be that hard to implement, given the fact that the whole notion of localized `JSX` is already implemented. I could even try to implement support for this myself. Would that be something that TS team could endorse?

EDIT:// I've tracked down [the PR adding support for this](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/22207) and it seems that what I'm after can actually be done by defining a factory function and a namespace with the same name. I had no idea that this is possible. In a way, my problem is solved with this - but I kinda still believe that looking up for a module-level `JSX` would be nice."

Backport of #46151 to release/5.0

Fixes: #45651

## Customer Impact

On Unix, when using blocking overloads of `Socket.ReceiveFrom` after an asynchronous call to the same socket, the call may return wrong `remoteEP`. Users of the `Socket` type working with UDP may hit this.

## Regression?

Yes. The behavior is correct on 3.1.

## Testing

In the original PR I extended `SocketTestHelper` so our existing `SendToRecvFrom_Datagram_UDP` tests can validate the sync-over-async path of the blocking `ReceiveFrom`. Unfortunately, those tests are disabled on the 5.0 branch, so I had to port a minimal subset of #44591 (the fix enabling the tests) so we can run them on CI for 5.0.

## Risk

Low. The bug was a small overlook, the product code change is minimal, and impacts only the affected sync-over-async `ReceiveFrom` path.

No. -1 is not considered as a valid value to mean gen2. Perhaps ""less defensive"" is a better description than ""careless"" in this case. One could imagine a less defensive implementation look like this.

```c++
int gen = GetObjectGeneration(...);
counter[gen]++;
```

or a more defensive one look like this:

```c++
int gen = GetObjectGeneration(...);
if (0 <= gen && gen <= 4)

As noted in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/60769#issuecomment-951114180, the assumption that the live-built runtime of version `(X+1).0` can be a drop-in replacement in an SDK of version `X.0` is sometimes wrong, and it currently breaks our stress tests.

This PR changes both local (non-containerized) and containerized stress builds to build against the live-built runtime with the help of [`targetingpacks.targets`](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/eng/targetingpacks.targets).

Some tricky parts:
- The docker builds no longer replace the shared dotnet runtime. Instead, we copy the live built runtime dll-s and ref dlls under `/live-runtime-artifacts` and reference that location from properties required by `targetingpacks.targets`
- We also copy testhost to `/live-runtime-artifacts`. Tests being executed by `TESTHOSTDIR/dotnet exec STRESSBINDIR/HttpStress.dll <args>` then.
- Since I wanted to avoid using the entire repository as the container context, `targetingpacks.targets` also goes to `/live-runtime-artifacts`
- HttpStress needs compatible (7.0) `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` bits. These are acquired by getting the latest daily SDK build with `dotnet-install.sh/ps1`
- This mechanism replaces the outdated `privateAspNetCore` stuff implemented in #33860
- To support local, non-containerized test execution helper scripts `build-local.ps1/sh` have been implemented. In case of HttpStress these scripts need to grab the daily SDK just like container scripts.
- Visual Studio experience is now broken for HttpStress, but it can be ""fixed"" by temporary local hacks if necessary

Fixes #60769.

The Regex span support changed the scanning infrastructure to always be based on spans.  That means that when a string is passed in by the caller, internally we still operate on it as a span.  That also means we can take advantage of slicing, and if the caller has specified via a beginning/length set of arguments that we should only process a substring, we can just slice to that substring.  That, however, then means that all offsets computed by the scanning implementation are 0-based rather than beginning-based.  The span change included a fixup for the overall match position, but not for the position of each individual capture, and that then meant that captures were providing the wrong values.  We unfortunately didn't have any tests for validating groups that also involved non-0 beginnings with string inputs.

"> @github thanks. you seem to indicate there is a race condition even in todays code, can you clarify?

The previous code used to assign `userEnv` from the window configuration and `shellEnv` in two promises running in parallel. There was no guarantee at which order they would run. Not sure if the existing code still suffers from this issue, I'm not sure where `userEnv` is assigned to `process.env` now.

> Unfortunately the assignment to process.env has to stay in preload.js because once we enable sandbox and contextIsolation you cannot change process.env outside of preload.js.

And this introduces a problem, for us to know if we should assign it, we need the `configuration.userEnv`, but that is only available later and is not supplied to that promise so it can make the decision. The promise that gets the configuration and the shell environment ones run in parallel. How should this be tackled? (P.S. If there is an acceptable way to pass it in, or do the check before it, we can also avoid sending the message to get the shell env at all if not needed)

Just reiterating so we are on the same page, the problem that this tries to fix is that VS Code is trying to check the wrong environment for `VSCODE_CLI` and `VSCODE_FORCE_USER_ENV`. It checks the parent process environment, rather than the environment of the new window, which makes it make the wrong decision based on the environment of the first opened window."

I was actually wrong here. Changes are applied to the data source on a background thread. This was allowing the background thread to run and force the update.
"I think projects tend to reuse shorthands. And certainly w/in a commit or series.

I'm also open to ideas for how to write rules for extra exclusions. e.g. Ignore strings shorter than x characters, or longer than y characters.

fwiw, there are 71 two-character (676 possible, 612 not in a dictionary*) and 399 three-character (17576 possible, 16991 not in a dictionary) tokens in the whitelist:

```
$ perl -pne 's/././g' .github/actions/spell-check/whitelist/*.txt|sort |uniq -c|sort -n|grep -A100 39
  39 ................
  47 ...............
  48 ..............
  71 ..
  93 .............
 105 ............
 150 ...........
 182 ..........
 240 .........
 309 ........
 311 ....
 324 .....
 348 .......
 356 ......
 399 ...
```
-- collectively, much more of the whitelist is 4+5+6 character sequences

Most of the annoying sequences I run into are hashes / base64 encodings (e.g. PKI or data: or git shas). My general response to those is to just ignore the file entirely -- the most common types are either .key/.pem/.crt or things like package.json/package-lock.json.

One thing you should do is review the whitelist, in reviewing it just now, I realized that there were a couple of misspellings in it... which I'm addressing by fixing & removing.

One example is `defing` which could easily be written out as `defining` if one wanted to force the word (the context is `#define` / `#undef`).

There's also the odd case of `TfEditses.cpp` -- that resulted in `Editses` being in the whitelist, but the thing is `EditSession` and it probably should be `TfEditSes.cpp`. -- Addressing that would be a distinct PR as it's a significant code change (renaming a file) and I'd definitely want pre-approval before considering it.

Note that you'll probably see things like `egistry` in the whitelist, since `\r` and `\t` are often used as escape characters, my code makes some assumptions at the expense of forcing people to whitelist some things which aren't actually misspelled in context. -- Windows unfortunately (for my code) tends to use `\` as a path delimiter which means that when my code looks at the string it's making the wrong guess and lopping off that `r` or `t`.

Anyway, please feel free to try it for a bit. I'm definitely eager to improve the experience."

Ah OK. I thought maybe it was something about the parameter types that were preventing the constexpr sort from working. I forgot it needed c++20. But even if the map construction were happening at build time, that's just improving the startup time - I wouldn't think it would make the lookup itself any faster. Anyway, it's not a big deal.

That is probably OK fall back strategy, but we need to confirm/understand exactly what is happening, whether that is an intentional fall back strategy or just an accident, etc. For example, does it mean that locals from the other accessor are in scope?

"> This effectively works via a blocklist approach, where a particular call site is blocklisted. Blocklisted call sites incur significantly more overhead. But that can significantly negatively impact a call site that’s shared infrastructure and just happens to be used in one place that’s blocking. For example, in ASP.NET MVC I assume there’s an async method somewhere that has the job of invoking controller actions; if just one synchronous controller action somewhere in the system ends up just once blocking on something via a Task, doesn’t that end up tainting every other controller operation in the whole system?

See (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47366#issuecomment-766288490). If the identification of the workitem is too coarse grained then it can be problematic. I see that as a problem but maybe one we can come up with creative solutions to (or maybe we need to opt out in those cases)

> If anything in the system ever blocks on a task just once on a thread pool thread (which I expect is super likely in a real app), every subsequent thread pool operation incurs the cost of multiple static field accesses plus a HashSet lookup. That is non trivial overhead.

This is problematic and concerns me as well. Ben and I spoke about this a little but haven't come up with anything as yet. I have some crazy ideas that would require @github approval 😄.

> It seems like this could actually introduce deadlocks where they wouldn’t otherwise happen. The code is forcing all work items associated with the blocklisted call sites into a single queue, and then relying on a subset of threads to process that queue. That subset is limited, much more so than the number of threads possible in the pool. If all of those threads end up getting blocked on something that requires that queue to be processed, it’ll deadlock, and as far as I can tell, neither the hill climbing nor the starvation prevention mechanisms will kick in to help, because they’re unaware of the this blocked queue (if additional threads were added for other reasons, than one might help out here, but it wouldn’t be provoked to by this).

Temporary deadlocks because the thread pool would grow anyways? This commit, requests a new thread https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47366/commits/f5702e8616a32febe839fcab7dc307cca67dafe6 which should signal to the thread pool that work that more threads are needed.

> This increased the size of every work item by a reference, which in most cases is a 25% increase. If you instead change it to have a virtual call to avoid the extra field, it’s an extra virtual dispatch on every work item. If you instead change it to try to consolidate to a single field, it’s an extra cast on every work item (or non-trivial additional unsafe casting).

I feel like if you can solve the hashset problem, you can potentially solve this as well. We need a fast way to identify if a workitem is potentially blocking. Are there any free bits in the object header 😄? 

> This adds significant complexity, duplicates key processing loops, incorporates somewhat arbitrary thresholds, and effectively adds a side pool. 

Right but it aims at dramatically improving a problem that our customers have that isn't going away. Lots of code we have like this has these types of arbitrary thresholds (sometimes without knobs...)

> It would require serious testing on a myriad of workloads to feel confident that this is the right approach and right set of tradeoffs.

"> What would be the size regression for R2R if it is enabled? It does not sound right to pessimize R2R like this. Note that some important 1st party teams are running R2R code without tiered compilation. If the size regression is non-acceptable, maybe this should be configurable?

Yes, it's configurable, customers can re-AOT CoreLib by using `DOTNET_JitExtendedDefaultPolicyPrejit=1` to use the new one.

Currently it adds around +1 Mb: 9.8Mb -> 10.8Mb (+10%) and depends on:
1) Max IL size (512 bytes of IL, 100 in the DefaultPolicy)
2) Max BB count (unlimited, used to be 5 in the )
3) We currently apply quite some big multiplier for methods with profile (in case if there are also other profitable observations).

So that +1Mb doesn't bring much value for customers who use Tiered JIT. However, @github, correct me if I'm wrong, but when the default inliner prejits code it also asks VM to save ""noinline"" for failed attempts, not only in the PrejitRoot mode (as I hoped) so it limits opportunities for the new one during re-jitting by disallowing it to inspect methods larger than 100 bytes of IL or >5 of BBs. 

I've just launched a couple of TE benchmarks to check ExtendedDefaultPolicy for R2R + TieredCompilation=0.

"> I'm assuming you meant `chars.Length == 24`

Yep, typed wrong in the first comment.

> Can't do this because a 17 and 18 byte string will also be 24 bytes when encoded.

Maybe I missunderstand something now, but the string is encoded and we try to decode it, then check if the decoded data (byte) is of size 16. 
So the other way round this means, 16 data bytes -> 24 base64 encoded utf8-bytes.
And for base64 the encoded length is always a multiple of 4.

Thus if `chars.Length != 24` we know that the decoded data won't be 16 bytes, so we can short-circuit the method and return `false`. No need to try to decode the input.

If `chars.Length == 24` we can try to decode, then check if `written == 16`.

Ahhhhh, now I see that in my previous comment it may look like the entire method. It's just a fragment. Sorry.

So I mean:
```c#
public static bool IsRequestKeyValid(string value)
{
    ReadOnlySpan<char> chars = value.AsSpan();

    if (chars.Length != 24)
    {
        return false;
    }

    Span<byte> temp = stackalloc byte[16];
    var success = Convert.TryFromBase64Chars(chars, temp, out int written);

    return written == 16 && success;
}
```

If you want I could submit a PR for the vectorized version (next week)."
"I suspect this problem relates to dotnet/arcade#4155 though it looks worse in this repo (which doesn't use System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource).

I also suspect an issue with `CoherentParentDependency` attributes because the ""Coherency Updates"" described above should be tied to EntityFrameworkCore dependencies. Those updates occurred _before_ anything from EntityFrameworkCore came in (see initial 396a4749372cdff207a1a17b16d7491ceba45633 commit). The only 'CoherentParentDependency` attributes in eng/Version.Details.xml tie things to Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.win-x64, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -- nothing from aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling.

More specifically, I now suspect the following is messing things up:
``` xml
<Dependency Name=""Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces"" Version=""1.0.0"" CoherentParentDependency=""Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.win-x64"">                                                                                                                <Uri>https://github.com/dotnet/corefx</Uri>                                                                             <Sha>4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea</Sha>                                                                   </Dependency>

@github shouldn't that dependency be pinned instead of made coherent with core-setup?

> Or subscription here is wrong???

FYI we do not subscribe directly to CoreFx or core-setup dependencies in this repo or AspNetCore-Tooling.

"Re problems making the repo build:
Installing nodejs  + yarn + JDK - not a great experience based on the docs. On Windows I was able to do all of this via winget eventually (after lot of searching) and probably a lot faster then following the various websites. On Linux it feels even worse - ended up searching how to do it via apt-get mostly.
But I must admit I never worked with nodejs and so on, so maybe this is just me doing it for the first time.

Lastly - I was trying this on Windows and Linux WSL. The WSL seems to cause issues for the Selenium based tests - I think I installed everything per the doc (but I could be wrong) and the Selenium tests were still failing for me.

I guess there's a bit of a weird dichotomy to the document - it starts explaining git in relative detail. But then the section on installing pre-reqs is often very short - especially nodejs which is basically just a link. I like that at least on Windows Java can be installed by a script - that helps a lot. Would be nice to have the same for Linux.

Very last minor nit: I use PowerShell even on Linux, but the PS scripts in the repo fail in weird ways when used on Linux (didn't investigate why). For example the `activate.ps1` misbehaves - and the shell script is not a replacement since it won't do me any good when in PS.

P.S.: I find it ""funny"" that the repo requires two competing stacks to build (NodeJS and Java). Maybe a short sentence on what they're used for?"

That all error handling and stdout in the arcade script is swallowed.

* Emojis are now rendered with proper alpha blending -- no black edges anymore, and the selected foreground color won't affect emojis anymore either (however the solution for this is rather hacky, because the DirectWrite API is absolutely unwilling to just give me the information I need grrr)

Related to #49206.
When we call runtime_invoke on wasm the exception always returns NULL and the error returns OK.
This was a problem because we were trying to get value of this new static property in DateTime type:
private static ReadOnlySpan<byte> DaysInMonth365 => new byte[] { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };
As we don't know that we were getting an exception, the value that returns to the test was wrong.
The goal of this PR is detect that we got an exception when running runtime_invoke and return the expected value to debugger.
This is a temporary solution, I think the final solution is to fix runtime_invoke to return exception correctly on WASM.
We also need to support it: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/b3411852caa6a3de8ab9fa27f7860c76ef43e384/src/mono/mono/metadata/object.c#L6298

"> Can you say a bit more about the problems you had with converting ` Object.GetType` and why you ultimately decided you could live without it...perhaps in an issue you open to track converting it to new style?

I didn't give up, just wanted to do it iteratively for all of them eventually to keep the PRs easier to review.

The primary goal is the ability to recognize `typeof(T) cmp typeof(T)` in inliner (and `String.Length`), from my understanding - foldable `obj.GetType() == typeof()` patterns where obj's type is known/final are less common (but I might be wrong).

`Object.GetType` led to this assert: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/coreclr/jit/importer.cpp#L8185

`eeCallInfo` returned `CORINFO_VIRTUALCALL_STUB` for it instead. I suspect the problem is here: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/coreclr/tools/aot/ILCompiler.ReadyToRun/JitInterface/CorInfoImpl.ReadyToRun.cs#L1587-L1589 (and a similar code in the native crossgen1)

Both crossgens know nothing about the new style intrinsics, I tried to fix this specific case like this https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/52156/commits/65a9154a5d4a2d8518022c58535d8a5a0c169872 and looked like it helped but none-windows platforms still asserted so I decided to postpone it a bit 🙁 "

The unit tests for `MemoryExtensions.EnumerateRunes` were originally checked in via https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/33504, but this was later reverted via https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/b016a5661ec64e7304380afa44ad9667bd5519a8 since the checkin was to the wrong file. This PR reintroduces those unit tests (to the correct file!) since we otherwise don't have test coverage over these APIs.

This is a test-only change. There are no changes to shipping code.

@github By ""wrong"" I mean the fast path is not taken, and even creates some overhead in cases where object is actually a subclass. Example (Default mode, Main):

We have a fast path for `A` in `TestMethod` but it won't be taken since I actually pass an instance of `B`. In my PR this problem is fixed - `A` is replaced with `likelyClass` which is `B`.

Add CI tests for notification profilers, and fix a couple things to make life with multiple profilers easier
* Reduced default timeout for profiler detach - we used to try at 300ms, 600ms, and then 10 minutes
* Got rid of a couple asserts that were wrong since switching from the dedicated profiler attach thread to the diagnostics server implementation
* ProfControlBlock::GetProfilerInfo would only work for active profilers, not attaching profilers, which could cause subtle bugs

- The sourcebuild team seemed supportive of the stream of changes around here. The changes were small and largely innocuous. They didn't really affect how we build the product, but enabled a customer's scenario of how they wanted to build the product. To me, in open source that's something we should support if it's not detrimental to the product. 
- Yes, portable builds are great for most things, but for that to work in the .NET ecosystem we always have to build in the lowest common denominator. We don't configure native builds in a way that all places where we toggle logic based on OS features can be done through runtime detection. They are often ifdef's that get enabled based on where we run CMake checks. You can build in a system that has the features you want to enable those paths, but that build is no longer portable. This felt like a reasonable mechanism to signify that. The main downside is the RID graph becomes crazy then for nuget and all the restore logic, but for a distro build of the SDK this didn't feel absurd."
"> COM doesn't support varargs. Can you point me at the location where this is used in the shuffle?

I made the changes using [#65584](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/65584) as a referrence. It works with HelloWorld'sh code, but I'm stuck with building it via build.cmd. It doesn't want to compile and I can't figure out why.

If that's the case, we probably don't need users to be able to tinker with the various properties, hence the internal FileListEntry and the public IFileListEntry that describes those properties as read-only.

Yes, I agree. However if we wanted we could swap the ""public interface, internal class"" pair with a ""public abstract class, internal concrete subclass"" pair. That has the benefit of letting us add more members in the future non-breakingly.

Imagine [this](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-a2c30b83123c3cb46ac84dae8175bc4bR24) accepts null and we want to pass `null` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fR68) (carries info ""didn't register specific TextSpan"") .  The `RegisterRefactoring` [just calls](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fL86) `_registerRefactoring` lambda with given parameters and so if we want to call it with `null` the [lambda](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fR30) needs to be of type `Action<CodeAction, TextSpan?>` (has to accept nullable `TextSpan`).

The lambda, however, isn't an implementation detail. It gets set in [*public* constructor](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37777/commits/b82e2c2baa57fe50af62353e3a1470ca915dba2b#diff-4b18194545a98c011598321cbfa1dd9fR52). And that leaks the information that the registration should somehow work with Nullable `applicableToSpan` 🤷‍♂️.

It's not terrible, nobody outside probably uses the constructor. But it _just feels weird_. Either have it nullable explicitly in `RegisterRefactoring` (but that communicates wrong idea about it being optional) or have it nowhere.

"This is wrong, you shouldn't need an space here as we add an space when passing the arguments down to the build script on the build step. Also this is only passed down when `isOfficialBuild == true` which in CI is never true, so this is not affecting your CI build. Also, remove the quotes around 'true' in the isOfficialBuild conditional as that might cause trouble in yml when evaluating booleans. I think the problem is somewhere in this condition here:

"The IDE has a different pattern than the compiler here: make the test assert what _should_ happen and then skip the test by putting the bug number in the skip attribute.

"`NotSupportedException` is generally used as the entire body of a method that doesn't make sense for a class that it's required to have because of a base class, interface, or compiler-recognized pattern.  Less often it's used for ""you're in the wrong mode"", e.g. a FileStream will report false for CanWrite if it was opened read-only, and Stream.Write will throw an NSE if CanWrite is false.

But for InvalidOperationException:

* DO throw an InvalidOperationException if the object is in an inappropriate state.

The state of this object is to write per some conformance mode, and that conformance mode says no indefinite arrays... so InvalidOperationException seems correct to me."

"Hi.

1) How does the component calculate the space for the content when expanded? As a test I added the expander around a vertical chat list of mine, and this is the result:
![Temp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60286968/79513737-34821980-804d-11ea-84d1-13d954f7fbab.gif)
As can be seen, the expander only shows around half of the height of the content. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?

2) I set the header up as such:
`
                            <StackLayout Orientation=""Horizontal"">
                                <Label Text=""Test2"" />

                            </StackLayout>
`

Just having a label is of course not enough to denote a foldable area, as the customer would never know it's a tappable widget. So I wanted to test having an upwards arrow indicator that turns into a downwards arrow when expanded. I couldn't find any easy way of doing it. Please advice on how to add a visual element that toggles between two states depending on whether the expander is folded or not. If this is not supported I'd urge to add support for it as I can't see much use for an expander that can't visualise its state.

Thank you."
"`FeaturesResources.operator_` is probably wrong here. It should be pluralized:  `FeaturesResources.Operators`, but this resource does not exist. Should I add it?

Is there any way to assert/throw if it's not on the XAML thread? I swear there's a way to tell because I've seen APIs throw/fail on me before for calling from the wrong thread.
"I don't think that this is the right approach because it changes the behavior for all IntelliSense users and it does so in a muscle-memory-breaking way. Often folks type ahead just to delete prefixes because they started with the wrong letter.

* make creation of `MyCompletionItem` faster
* TypeScript can cap the amount of results it returns, mark results as incomplete so that ask again on subsequent typing"
"This one is dumb. I even asked Leon about it a while back and we couldn't figure it out. `SelectedItem` takes an `IInspectable`, but for some reason XAML/WinRT isn't smart enough to automatically convert between an `hstring` and an `IInspectable`:

"> Maybe the island window is placing itself on top of the draw window on a resize, and we just need to move the drag window back on top of the island window (in the z-order)? I'm no expert here so that's just a guess.

Sorry I've explained the problem badly. The problem is that when I resize the window with `SetWindowPos` or `MoveWindow`, it looks like it doesn't do anything! The new area of the window doesn't receive any `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` messages, as if the resize didn't happen. Maybe I'm using the API wrong. I checked with a tool and the window's size actually changes, but it just doesn't receive any mouse message over the new area. If I recreate the window with the new position and width, it works again. I'm no expert either. "

"> Any idea how long a ""quick"" change will now be, e.g. a Documentation change (no tests at all!)? Can we get a ""lower-bound"" for turnaround time? Will the ""upper time"" be any worse?

From what I've seen so far these changes allow for ~2 hour PR builds (though I've seen a 98 minute run). Our build job takes roughly an hour on average, and this PR will still run four test jobs by default for every PR build (the longest of which can also take up to an hour). In theory a documentation change wouldn't even require a build, perhaps we can look at improving this further for certain source paths in the future.

Upper bound timing should be mostly unchanged, though it's possible we see some minor improvements there. Our longest jobs are typically Nodes 1 and 3 of our Legacy or One .NET MSBuild tests, and these jobs will now skip tests marked with the `SmokeTest` category (as they will have ran during the smoke test stage). 


> Another crazy idea: add or $(System.JobAttempt) > 1 to the conditions, and then we could click the Rerun stage button to kick off tests from the UI. 😉

I really like the idea of using `$(System.StageAttempt)` or `$(System.JobAttempt)` as a way of running extra test jobs without having to queue a new instance, but I think I'd want to try to experiment with that in a separate PR as the scope has grown quite a bit already."

"It isn't wrong from a technical perspective, since that is how it can be done. However, what is stated is misleading and isn't what is really desired . This API shouldn't be considered an export of `objc_msgSend` because it isn't. In this form it is a specialized use case for `objc_msgSend` with no arguments and that is confusing given how this function actually operates. We also hit concerns with one of the new APIs being introduced around overriding the export look up. I was preferring this to be done in Objective-C naturally instead of expose its weirdness at the C# level.

This also makes the C# far more common for those who maintain it and pushes the Objective-C semantics to be the responsibility of the Objective-C compiler."
"My interpretation of the TODO question is to decide if we instead want something like:
```cs
public virtual IntPtr Handle => _strategy.GetHandle();

And have the strategy itself determine what the logic would be:
```cs

{
  ...
  public override IntPtr GetHandle() => SafeFileHandle.DangerousGetHandle();
  ...
}
```

But please correct me if I'm wrong, @github.

If it's what I described, then I think I would prefer to have _all_ logic moved to the strategy itself. It would be consistent with other properties: `IsClosed`, `CanSeek`, `CanRead`, `CanWrite`, `Name`, `IsAsync`, etc.

If it's what @github described - Then I think having `_strategy.SafeFileHandle` would made make sense than calling `SafeFileHandle` directly, since the logic is _kind of_ deferred to the strategy, but this would not be consistent with how other properties are working."
"Please don't add `JavaNativeTypeManager.GetJniSignature(mi)` to this codepath.  It's already reflection heavy, and this would only make it *worse*:

Only the name is required.

For further rationale, build e.g. `samples/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.csproj`, and then view `samples/HelloWorld//HelloWorld/obj/Debug/android/src/example/MainActivity.java`:

```java

		mono.android.Runtime.register (""HelloWorld.MainActivity, HelloWorld"", MainActivity.class, __md_methods);
```

The method this will lookup is `GetOnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_Handler`.  That's *very* unique, and not likely to cause conflicts.

*Furthermore*, the types are wrong; `signature` would be `(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V`, while `GetOnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_Handler` (generated in e.g. `src/Mono.Android/obj/Debug/monoandroid10/android-32/mcw/Android.App.Activity.cs`) is:

```csharp
		static Delegate GetOnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_Handler ()
		{
			if (cb_onCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_ == null)
				cb_onCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_ = JNINativeWrapper.CreateDelegate ((_JniMarshal_PPL_V) n_OnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_);
			return cb_onCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_;
		}

which would imply a ""signature"" of `()V` (no parameters, returns `void`), which *will rarely match*."
"> 5. The app aborts at run time instead.

I think this is basically what you got with dx + proguard ^^ You get runtime errors and have to read the build log to figure out what is wrong.

If I change this test to use dx+proguard instead of multi-dex:

I get warnings and it builds. But if I switch to r8, it will error unless we supply `-ignorewarnings`.

After `-ignorewarnings`, you get the same amount of warnings, but the build succeeds.

I think we should go with `-ignorewarnings` for all usage of r8, and I just need to add some release notes here?

"I just want to say that I have done some testing with the exising CreateProcess flag `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE`. The case I tried was not documented anywhere by Microsoft as far as I could find, and the results were unexpected *to me*.

I have an `.exe` that's a GUI application and has an option to print output to a console. It is an official Microsoft tool actually, `dpinst.exe` with its `/C` argument. From my observations, this is a GUI exe and when you add the `/C` option it attaches to the parent-process' console and prints to `CONOUT$` (not Standard Output ...).

It was my impression that, when I launch `dpinst.exe /C` with CreateProcess and CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE, a console would be attached to the process. But that's not the case. It appears CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE currently has absolutely no effect on GUI-subsystem executables! There was no new console window or process created and dpinst continued to print its output to the *parent* process' console.

To me this was unexpected. If a GUI program can call AllocConsole to gain a console, why can't I force that at process creation time with a Flag that's supposed to do exactly that? It works for TUI programs.

I don't have the source code for `dpinst.exe`, you guys do. Does it just always do a `AttachConsole( ATTACH_PARENT_PROCESS);` regardless of whether it already has a console itself? Or maybe I did something wrong, but I find it very odd I am not able to spawn a GUI process with a ""forced"" console attached by default and I would like to be able to do that in the future if the APIs around this are going to be expanded :)"

"> If the situation still sucks, and part rejection is still an opaque and painful thing to figure out

Part rejection is easy to figure out now. You can get a feel for it by stepping through this block:

https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/9bca5a2861d3ebb2f34bc36536d96d478898c64d/src/Workspaces/CoreTestUtilities/MEF/ExportProviderCache.cs#L211-L238"
"For crossgen I believe this change is strictly an improvement. However, I see that you did not make the corresponding change in crossgen2. However, this isn't necessarily the wrong choice. Crossgen2 does not use the IsSupported function call mechanism, but instead it performs speculative compilation assuming the processor intrinsic IS available which yields excellent performance for this case on Haswell and newer processors."
"I actually like getting both errors in this case because the two locations make clear what's going on -- that you have one more open tag than closing tag, and that the offending unclosed tag is at some other location. When you only give the first error, it makes it sound like you have the _wrong_ closing tag somewhere else; when you only give the second error, you have no idea what tag needs closing.
"
"> So if, with hindsight, Yarn and PNPM are now seeking to replace `node_modules` with a more industrial strength resolver, why not just propose a really great design, and everyone can adopt that?

Because as always, the question isn't to have a great design but rather to gather support around it. When you consider that even now the only package manager in Node is controlled by a for-profit and that it takes **crazy significant** efforts to improve even that, I can't imagine the amount of work that a proposal such as Plug'n'Play would require - and how much of my family time it would consume.

So of course in an ideal world PnP should be implemented in Node, and I'd be open to help with that (or even do most of the work), but it likely won't happen until the Node TSC comes to us with a firm Intent to Implement so that I know it won't be all for nothing. In the meantime, the best I can do is to [document the standard and API](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnpapi) the best I can and work with third-party project to make ""PnP as a plugin"" a reality. I think it worked very well so far, even though there's still this kind of PR every once in a while.

> I'd like to hear more motivation for having an executable format for the pnp file.

This point in particular got discussed a few times already (for example [here](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6388)), but I think the TS team demonstrated since then why the executable format is just fine: the data format actually got implemented in May 2019 - a year and a half ago - but it didn't do anything to bring PnP closer from TS. Given that it was literally its only purpose, it shows that we should optimize the format for the convenience of our team rather than for theoretical use cases."

"I'm relatively new to the watch code, but I wanted to write out my understanding of the original code and this PR in case it clears things up (so do correct me if I'm wrong).

It seems like `watchPresentFileSystemEntry` will call `fs.watch` and only fall back to `watchPresentFileSystemEntryWithFsWatchFile` when needed. That function is documented in some comments as being based on polling (the function name is super long so I'm just going to call it ""the polling watcher"" from now on).

The original big long condition in `callbackChangingToMissingFileSystemEntry` is true when the there's a rename event and the file no longer exists, which then leads to the watcher being turned into a polling watcher that waits until an event fires, then recreates the watcher with `watchPresentFileSystemEntry` again.

The PR changes the condition to, on a rename, if it doesn't exist, do the same thing as above, but if it does exist, the watcher is recreated assuming that a rename event is likely to mean that the folder points somewhere else on disk via a different inode (as documented in the PR description), but is done so by calling that polling watcher creation function.

That latter point I think is the contentious one; I'd think that if we know (or very likely know) that the watcher is now bad, that it would need to be recreated via `watchPresentFileSystemEntry` in order to have it potentially pick the non-polling watcher again (as it would have originally).

But, it also feels like it _should_ be expensive to be recreating directory watches (which are potentially recursive) over and over again. Maybe that's why the PR uses polling in the first place, because those are effectively ""free"" given they defer work until some later poll as opposed to asking the system to do some work?

Maybe ideally, it'd be nice if there was a cheap way to just get the inode number of a directory and compare it without doing the work to recreate a watcher (but, this feels like something that node's watcher should really be handling, as the API is based on paths, and it sure would be a surprise for watchers to just totally stop working depending on the details of what some program does to rename or replace a directory/file with other contents or something)."

"> I think having bold in the color table is an essential prerequisite for getting the bold color to work

LOL. Clearly I was wrong, since the bold seems to working fine in this PR as far as I can tell.

That said, I still think this functionality should probably not be enabled by default, because there are going to be edges cases that don't work, and that's kind of inevitable when we're deliberately choosing to alter the colors that were requested.

As one example, if you're using a ""standard"" color scheme, like Campbell, where the default background is identical to black, and the default foreground is identical to white, then both these sequences should be invisible, but they aren't:

    printf ""\e[0;30mHIDDEN\e[m\n""
    printf ""\e[0;47mHIDDEN\e[m\n""

That particular case may be fixable, but there'll always be something. Having the default behavior be technically incorrect feels like we're asking for bug reports."

"I was wrong, there wasn't any more to the situation than that, and moving the hash set within the driver was easy. Your suggest to manage this with events is appealing, partly because doing that would remove the irregular treatment of syntax tree actions in the driver. Making that change now is less pressing with management of this issue moved completely within the driver.
"
"@github @github 
The <a href=""https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/16646#pullrequestreview-47396091"">original justification</a> for the change was: to make version parsing easier.

Given how parsing issues escalated, while compiler gained unnecessary variable and all these troubling cross-referencing comments — is it better to revisit?

If TSC goes back to dumb simple `export const version = ""2.5.0"";` all these quirks go away. More to it, built TSC.JS has version in a plain parseable format.

Compare old simple way:
``` typescript
(function (ts) {
    ts.version = ""2.4.1"";
})(ts || (ts = {}));
```

With what we got today:
```typescript
(function (ts) {
    ts.versionMajorMinor = ""2.5"";
    ts.version = ts.versionMajorMinor + "".0-dev.20170719"";
})(ts || (ts = {}));
```

All that trouble for the sake of splitting `versionMajorMinor` off `version`. Could have just gone `version.split('.').slice(0,2).join('.')`."
Type is wrong. Should be `...arg0: any[]` that little bit not being implemented is probably why it was asserted.
"> I think that this should be kept.

I agree. As I said, this is just not the right place for it, it makes:

a) `fgArgTabEntry::getSize` return the wrong value on LA for this special case.
b) Refactoring `fgMorphArgs` harder and riskier (and that function is already notoriously fragile), due to its placement outside the `else`."
"This is doesn't preserve the order in which expressions are visited, which leads to a wrong behavior when duplicate declarations are involved. Please fix. 
"
"Aren't all special types and members required to be in a valid corlib? I believe so and if that's true then any existing tests were testing the wrong thing.
"
"this was just wrong, as far as I can tell, but only was used for tags followed by a newline:

```js
@github
stuff
``` "
"We don't necessarily need the temp variable when we're *not* using the value, but I also think this emit is wrong when we *do* use the value.

Consider:
```js
let a = ""0"";
let b = a++;
console.log(typeof a, a); // number 1
console.log(typeof b, b); // number 0
```
If we use `_a` here, it should already have been coerced to a number, so the emit should start with `_a = +__classPrivateFieldGet(this, _text)`.

Please modify this test to include cases where the value of the expression is used (i.e. `x = this.#test++`)."
"@github, I may be wrong, but I thought we had plans to support instrumentation on legacy applications as well.
"
"> While the semantic meaning is the same, the original code much more clearly conveys intent. Using u8 obscures the intent.

I'm fine reverting it, but I don't understand the intent argument.  Why is the intent any clearer with the former over the latter?  The intent of the former is so obscured that it required a comment explaining how it was derived (and the comment is wrong :)"
"In the case of a named import, the `type` modifier need not be present _on_ the named import; it could be present on the parent import declaration... afraid calling this “TypeOnlyModifierBlah” makes you focus on the wrong thing."
"> One of the primary drivers was concern around non-determinism, and whether folks might write catch blocks for just the target exception and not realize they need to handle an aggregate as well, and then even if they did realize it, end up needing to duplicate all of their exception handling logic to handle both the single and aggregate cases.

I can definitely see where that's coming from, but I wonder if suppressing exception information is desireable in principle: it could be argued, especially if you subscribe to the ""let it crash"" school of thought, that logging exceptions is more important than handling them.

In this particular case it probably doesn't matter, I don't think STJ users would or should try to handle this particular exception. It's meant to address a corner case of a corner case, where there is likely something wrong in their `I(Async)Disposable` implementation, so reporting back with as much information as possible seems appropriate."
"> From discussion with Carlos: the only thing I'd really want to block over is the flag pointing the wrong direction when it's at a terminus.

This is done. But I'm gonna take it a step further in the next commit. Instead of wrapping the marker onto the previous/next line, just flip it. That's a lot more intuitive.

"@github We're planning on shipping this in Preview 1.15, the next Terminal release. Typically, these releases are about 6 weeks apart. We'll get to elaborating on the docs once we get closer to release.

Trying to parse everything there and translate it to what we've got so far:
* ""click and drag (highlight) somewhere with the mouse""->""press any arrow key while holding shift""
  - I think this actually shipped in 1.13, IIRC. Definitely in 1.14.
* ""At this point you can release the left-click (1) or shift (2). ... and you can now move anywhere with just the arrow keys""
  - @github would have to clarify this one for me. I _think_ that at this point, just arrow keys won't move the cursor. 
  - HOWEVER, if you started the selection by pressing `ctrl+shift+m` (or whatever you bind mark mode to), then just arrow keys _will_ move the cursor.
* ""To highlight you then hold shift while using arrow keys similar to the highlighting logic of holding left-click while moving the mouse.""
  - Yep, that's how mark mode works.
* ""Copying can happen in 2 ways:....""
  - This I _don't_ think we have today (again, Carlos correct me if I'm wrong). We may need to add an arg to `copyText` to specifically ask that the selection is not dismissed."

"So they added a new function that ends up with the same signature for us 😒 

The `2` suffix makes it sound like we did something wrong... but no other good option comes to mind either. Maybe `CanPerformUnwindAction`? `CanPerformSegueUnwind`? `CanPerformUnwindSegueAction`?

Also maybe add some `#if XAMCORE_4_0` spaghetti to rename the old function `CanPerformUnwindDeprecated` and the new one `CanPerformUnwind`."

> Basically the problem comes when you've got say en-US as default and es-ES installed also. If the user asks for a time zone string for es-MX, we need to return the one from es-ES, not the one from en-US.

"This is both right and wrong at the same time.

It's right in the sense that you're removing `#if !MONOMAC`, and then to get the same result you need to add this attribute.
It's wrong because these APIs seem to actually exist in macOS (12).

I'm guessing we added these APIs at some point, with the correct availability attributes, not realizing that the code was inside a `#if !MONOMAC` block, and as such the API wouldn't be exposed on macOS.

The correct fix here is to maintain the attributes as-is (and remove the `#if MONOMAC` condition as you do), and then verify with intro/xtro/documentation that these APIs actually exist and are correct on macOS.

That's much bigger than just a mechanical conversion of this framework, but I think it's worth it (it's also a pretty small framework, so it shouldn't be too much work)."
"> I think a delayed diagnostic will address the concerns and ensure we don't have duplicate diagnostics.

I don't think the delayed diagnostics is the right approach here. Mainly because we will have to control when it is getting resolved, which is hard to do given that we are trying to move the work from one pipeline phase to the other.

>It's very flaky. Not only the new test. But I see other existing tests can randomly have the diagnostics from the compilation of the new test. I can't understand how the diagnostics leaked into a whole different compilation.

"So as I understand it the purpose of the ""does overflow"" checks is that RangeCheck does not model overflow (since it cannot...).

Except in the special case of all constant ranges it seems:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/a3b186b9904844b8001d4bb5d7474f2591ee96d9/src/coreclr/jit/rangecheck.h#L238-L251

So _I think_ that the assertion ""if the ranges are all constant, there could have been no overflow"" is correct.

Now, what is perhaps far more curious is the ""does it overflow"" logic itself, which says that if the end result of the SSA use-def chain walk is an `IND`, it does not overflow. This makes sense insofar as RangeCheck does not work with indirections, thus could not have drawn wrong conclusions earlier, when computing the ranges (another way to put it is that an indirection in the dependency chain will always be terminating, not result in a dependent range).

What makes me wonder then is why don't we consider chains ending in, say, parameters (as is the case here) as non-overflowing."

"We might be able to heuristically recognize type-specializing opcode sequences and branching patterns during our initial IL scan/profitability check. At this level we would not know what methods get called and whether or not they are intrinsic. It would be pretty ad-hoc as we can't even do simple dataflow at that level today.

Assuming we could guess right much of the time, we could ""discount"" the cost of the candidate to be the estimated cost of one of the branch cases plus the cost of any ""unconditional"" IL, and provisionally accept the inline. I have written heuristics like this in the past and they're tricky to get right without fairly strong models for control flow; we don't have that here either.

Similar perhaps for size-specializing patterns.

When we actually go to import the inlinee, if it then turned out we were wrong and things didn't simplify, we could reject then to keep code size small. But we'd have burned a fair bit of jit time and memory in the process.

So the key would be to get good recognition accuracy, so that jit throughput is not unduly impacted by things that look promising but don't pan out.

An alternative is to try and do this recognition either in the language compiler or in some other precompilation tool and just leave breadcrumbs for the jit."
"> If there's a mechanical fix to update existing code, it'd worthwhile to have that in the release notes for 3.9.

Write an `Extract` everywhere we now (correctly) flag as a type error, `(or, better yet, write types that actually check out without contortions). It's the typesystem equivalent of a typecast, but it's much more explicit.

eg,
```ts
type GetClass<T extends any> = T[""class""];

// could be
type GetClass<T> = Extract<T, {class: any}>[""class""];
```
obviously, you can replace `Extract` with a helper that provides a more reasonable default on failure than `never` for your given situation, too.

It was possible for us to underestimate the size of temps required. This
happened because we used the state of the frame layout to check if the
size of temps was computed and that check was wrong. This could lead us
to make different decisions about which registers needed to be saved in
the prolog and epilog on ARM32. In particular, if the frame size was
around the size where a stack probe is necessary, this could be
possible.

There are also other comments that suggest that this could result in
failure while encoding instructions that reference the stack locals.

"@github I have a suggested refactoring to make (though it is almost certainly not an appropriate time to perform that suggestion).  Specifically, I believe the existing system for ScanXXX+ParseXXX in LanguageParser amounts to a huge amount of complexity for little (if any) gain.  I have an alternate approach i think would be superior and better for the long term health of the parser.

The primary problem today is that the parser needs to encode all the parsing rules all over again into the ScanXXX functions , keeping both in sync, and trying to ensure that the appropriate results from scanning carry over to parsing. 

There is an alternative approach that can be taken, which we followed in TypeScript.  You can see that approach here:
https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/src/compiler/parser.ts#L1020  (example explained in more depth below).

Specifically, instead of actually having a separate scanning step, we just went ahead and tried the parse, passing in whatever flags were appropriate for the current parse context, and specifying what behavior we wanted if the parse ran into issues.  Effectively, with LanguageParser, this would just be using reset points, and asking to rollback once enough information was gleaned from the parse to determine that the wrong speculative path had been taken.

The concern with this approach was of course one of allocation cost.  i.e. would the cost of allocations be a hindrance to parsing speed.  In practice, we found that cost to be completely negligible in most cases, and easily worked around in the rare cases where it did impact.  Specifically, we found that the majority of code tends to follow a more common case, and that case should be what the speculative parsing code looks for first.  In the rare cases where that doesn't follow, usually a little lookahead (which is vastly less complex than the arbitrary 'scanning' subsystem that we have) can allow for a sensible direction to take.  And, when that doesn't suffice, you do just do the arbitrary parsing+rollback.

--

I only bring this up because i know how tricky it's been over time to try to get scanning+parsing to work with these more and more complex expression constructs.  While it would not be trivial to move off of scanning, I do think it would make for a vastly simpler system, and would actually pay dividends later as new language features would be easier to incorporate.

Anyways, just my 2c.  If you'd like to discuss this further (including offline, or not in this PR) I'm happy to assist.

--

Example: explained.  

Here's an example of how TS deals with the ```<``` ambiguity we also have in C#:

```c#
                    // See if this is the start of a generic invocation.  If so, consume it and
                    // keep checking for postfix expressions.  Otherwise, it's just a '<' that's
                    // part of an arithmetic expression.  Break out so we consume it higher in the
                    // stack.
                    const typeArguments = tryParse(parseTypeArgumentsInExpression);
...
        function parseTypeArgumentsInExpression() {
            if (!parseOptional(SyntaxKind.LessThanToken)) {
                return undefined;
            }

            const typeArguments = parseDelimitedList(ParsingContext.TypeArguments, parseType);
            if (!parseExpected(SyntaxKind.GreaterThanToken)) {
                // If it doesn't have the closing >  then it's definitely not an type argument list.
                return undefined;
            }

            // If we have a '<', then only parse this as a argument list if the type arguments
            // are complete and we have an open paren.  if we don't, rewind and return nothing.
            return typeArguments && canFollowTypeArgumentsInExpression()
                ? typeArguments
                : undefined;
        }
```

Here, there's no need for a separate ScanTypeArgumentList function.  TypeScript simply goes through and actually attempts the parse, easily falling back if it fails.  Because the logic is just in a single place, there aren't two codepaths to keep in sync.  Also, this code can be extremely flexible.  For example, we could have code like the above, but extend it so that if we see things like primitive types (i.e. int/string/etc.) in the delimited list, then we would always consider it a type argument list.  i.e. ```List<int>``` would always parse as a type-arg list, even though it isn't followed by something like ```(```.

Right now we accomplish that in the scanning phase, but it's extremely tricky to get right.  By moving it right into the parsing phase, we can do much richer analysis as we have the full tree up to that point (as well as any future tokens) to look at at make determinations.

--

In the end, everything can be done with ScanXXX.  But it really does add lots of complexity (esp. as expressions have gotten a lot more ambiguous).  Moving away from this into a simpler ""just do the parse and make the decisions based on how it's gone and what you can see coming up"" can make life much simpler and easier.

"It kind of sucks, but the only solution I can think of now is to use one of the ""dangerous"" APIs - like `Assembly.GetType` or maybe even better (more future proof) `Assembly.GetTypes` and effectively write the ""GetType"" functionality manually.

I think the only ""correct"" solution is adding a public API which describes the intent - so something like `Type.GetTypeIfExists` (probably needs better name) which would intentionally be marked as 'trim friendly"" without any intrinsic handling in the linker."

This seems wrong. It seems like we should rename `emitOutputSizeT` to `emitOutputTargetSizeT` and have it take a `target_ssize_t`.

"I'm just using the equality members generated by Resharper (because why keep the dozen things you can do wrong with equality members in your head when a robot can do it for you?).

In this case, Resharper chooses `Equals` over `==`, probably because `Spacing` is a `double` and Resharper generally warns against using `==` for floating-point numbers (because in _most_ cases what you really want is a comparison within a tolerance). So this avoids a (wrong in this case) warning from Resharper.

Yeah, and we're not really changing these tests all the time. I did just add a ""nice to have"" where it all goes to a .g.cpp file though. So this process is now so much easier!

How did we come up with the test cases that are failing currently but shouldn't be? Just logically working out what they _should_ be doing? Was there some sort of reference app that you used to construct these cases? (this is merely a curiosity)

Updated the README to talk a bit more about this, actually. There's kinda two types of tests that we're skipping for now:
1. we're wrong: I used MS Word to test what the behavior should be and added them to the CSV file as `skip=false`. Then, when they fail in TAEF, I double check that I translated MS Word correctly.
2. for #6986: we'll need _a lot_ of tests to make sure this works correctly. The idea here is that anything past the ""document end"" will be treated as a degenerate range at document end. So this is gonna be a really nice transition where I'll just update the CSV appropriately and generate/run the tests."

Hoy boy. Whatever it is, it's fixed in my `dev/migrie/b/3493-no-wrap-alt-buffer` branch for #3493. I wanted to keep that separate but maybe there's something in there that really _does_ need to be here. "

I've sent out another PR (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/56490) and added more tests here, but those seem to pass. I'm stumped again.

The PackageId is wrong: `System.Runtime.NumericsTestData`. It should instead be `System.Runtime.Numerics.TestData`.

Actually I think I'm wrong. This has nothing to do with `ConstructAutoPropertyAccessorBody`. Will need to re-check things.
"IMO we should treat _pMatchedLength_ as a write-only pointer and should never attempt to read from it. The reason for this is that the memory contents are controlled by an entity outside of the native ICU code, and if there's a background thread mutating the contents of this memory while we're trying to use it, we could end up reading the wrong value and charge down an unexpected code path."
The `preview4` part here looks wrong to me too.
"We could.  I don't know that it would help with a lot.

"@github I don't see any reason why ""Begin"" as a normal verb (not any sort of keyword) needs to capitalized. Probably it was just written wrong once and copied/pasted in all summaries."
"@github, I am the author of [@github/mutrait](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/mutrait), which enables stateful traits in JavaScript.  I'm trying to use what this PR enables in order to implement a similar thing in TypeScript, but I'm still not sure if the language's type system permits it.  I have a github repo demonstrating the issue at https://github.com/matthewadams/typescript-trait-test.

TL;DR: I'm basically trying to enable a simple way for folks to define traits & enable their classes to express them, like `class Person extends trait(Nameable) { ... }` (one trait) or `class Person extends traits(Nameable).with(HasParents).with(HasChildren).apply() { ... }` (multiple traits).  The traits provide default implementations of isolated functionality, and the goal is that classes expressing traits can override methods provided by the trait.

This leverages the subclass factory pattern you describe at the top of this issue, but attempts to do so in a way that allows a class to override functionality.  Your example illustrates that you can add functionality to a class, but you can't customize it easily because the subclass factory-created class _extends_ the class receiving the functionality, instead of the other way around.

This works fine in JavaScript using `@github/mutrait`, and we use it with great success.  I'm just having some trouble describing the typing correctly.  If you could have a look at my repo and tell me if I'm doing something wrong, or if TypeScript's typing system doesn't support what I'm trying to do, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks in advance for this.  Because we leverage traits in many of our projects, this is preventing us from using TypeScript more often."
"The BCL ultimately calls the system APIs for things like socket communication and add a C# API on top of it.

The issue I described above is with the remote reverse server, _not_ the code in runtime itself.  This is effectively a test issue and not a product issue.  The runtime is doing the correct thing, but the ""correct"" thing is resulting in a hang because the system level APIs are not behaving.

I would not expect a well behaved reverse server to operate like this.  I would expect it to behave as you describe, i.e., create the socket once, bind to it, and manage the returned sockets from calls to `accept`.  This test is specifically designed to stress the polling and retry logic of the runtime in the presence of a misbehaving reverse server.  In other words, the test server is supposed to be doing the wrong thing and the runtime should be able to handle it.

The race I observed seems to be something unique to macOS and how the socket APIs behave.  I'd be curious to see if this behavior repros on other BSD based operating systems.  I would expect the BCL to fall prey to this same race on macOS since Syetm.Net.Sockets ultimately calls the same APIs as my C++/C# code is.  There isn't anything in the BCL that could prevent this since it has to do with the order that system level APIs are called and not the infrastructure (like the async engine) that the BCL adds on top of that."

The Arcade.SDK already package refrences the ILLink package. The
duplicate reference in illink.targets caused SDK errors as the Arcade
reference has IsImplicitlyDefined set which doesn't allow an additional
reference with the same identity.

Also, as the ILLink package already exposes the path to the assembly via
its props file, using that instead of manually constructing the path to
the assembly.

The SDK target version update is required as the sequencing of the
ILLink.props file was wrong and is required for this change. This isn't
considered a breaking change, as the SDK's minimum required version
isn't changed.

In ImmutableList.cs, just like ""IndexOf()"" and the last ""LastIndexOf()"" method, we don't need to do checks for list.Count generated by dotnet-robot, because when it equals to 0, it will return you -1 instead of throwing exceptions.

On the other hand, there's something wrong with the check:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/84bad7e24589169975ec8a599743110d703c761b/src/libraries/System.Collections.Immutable/src/System/Collections/Immutable/ImmutableList.cs#L289-L292

In fact, when list.Count = 0, this already means we've no elements there, no need to check ""startIndex = 0"".

"@github What do you mean by deprecating RIDs for linux? There is no single Linux we could use (yeah, the current naming is wrong) so different Linux distributions could be (e.g. due to different libc) incompatible."
"@github, correct. The apphost package (`microsoft.netcore.app.crossgen2.<platform>-<arch>.<version>.nupkg`) restored for crossgen2 on the `main` branch is using linux-x64 when we pass `-cross` or `-p:CrossBuild=true` to `./build.sh`. Which is incorrect when target is anything other than linux-x64. The crossgen2 tool used to cross build _during_ the build is correct (i.e. when `CrossBuild = true`, it should use CG2 built with host compatible apphost, rather than that of target's).

The reason why we don't see any error on main branch is because of the wrong `Crossgen2PackageRID` value which is fixed by first commit in this PR. With that fix, the FreeBSD CI leg started to fail during apphost package restore like this:

> .dotnet/sdk/6.0.100/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.FrameworkReferenceResolution.targets(129,5): error NETSDK1084: (NETCORE_ENGINEERING_TELEMETRY=Restore) There is no application host available for the specified RuntimeIdentifier 'freebsd-x64'.

"Using `LowLevelMonitor` actually solves the problem of this PR, but perhaps for a wrong reason. `LowLevelMonitor` is a reentrant lock and that allows nested `CreateThreadLocalCountObject`, it just creates a redundant `ThreadLocalNode` in a very rare scenario. Seems better than a deadlock though.

Reentering the type system may be a bigger concern, although it might be ok and even expected since typesystem might need to access itself recursively anyways."

Now consider [v2.0's `Write(int)` method](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/9ed868e36921eb27ce68400c3fa38f2a5e456a00/src/MessagePack.UnityClient/Assets/Scripts/MessagePack/MessagePackWriter.cs#L399) which compresses and [v2.0's `WriteInt32(int)`](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/9ed868e36921eb27ce68400c3fa38f2a5e456a00/src/MessagePack.UnityClient/Assets/Scripts/MessagePack/MessagePackWriter.cs#L439) which does _not_ compress.

Therefore the equivalency table is:

| v1.x | v2.x |
|--|--|
| MessagePackBinary.WriteInt32 | MessagePackWriter.Write(int) |
| MessagePackBinary.WriteInt32ForceInt32Block | MessagePackWriter.WriteInt32 |"
"@github that is a fair point, but we'd probably only file NFWs for specific failures. For instance, if we can't find the requested service we would *not* file an NFW as that could be very much by design for a componentized, optional install model -- or just development error on the part of the caller. But if something infrastructural goes wrong (an internal error of ServiceHub) than ideally ServiceHub should file the NFW, I agree."

"@github Thanks very much for moving this forwards and continuing to refine it! Mostly this looks like really good stuff, but one aspect of the implementation makes me think we could refine it further. I suppose there are two aspects:

 * Trying to capture the `byte[]` instances in a context-specific way using unusual techniques like relying on non-nested invocations, the `Semaphore`, etc. This is kind of complex and subtle, and would at the very least need to get more complex still to handle nested invocations (which actually are a thing, since you can put a `[JsonConverter]` on any type and then put inside it custom logic which could in turn do JS interop or other serialization).
 * Passing the `byte[][]` parameters through all the various layers has a very noisy impact all over the API surface, and means this will always be a thing we have to allow for when doing any future maintenance on JS interop.

I think there could be an alternative way to capture and pass the `byte[]` instances that avoids both of these problems, plus is simpler overall. That is:

 * For the .NET-to-JS direction:
   * The `JSRuntime` base class could set up a single `ByteArrayJsonConverter` that, whenever it sees a `byte[]`, *immediately* gives it an incrementing ID and passes the `byte[]` to JS without tracking it anywhere in .NET memory, and uses the ID in the serialized JSON (e.g., `{ __dotNetByteArray: 123 }`).
   * For example, `JSRuntime` could have a new method like `protected virtual void SupplyByteArray(long id, byte[] data)`, whose default implementation just throws `NotSupportedException`
   * Each `JSRuntime` subclass can take care of getting the array over to JS and calling some new function inside `Microsoft.JSInterop.ts` like `DotNet.jsCallDispatcher.supplyByteArray(id: number, data: UInt8Array)`. The implementation of that function tracks the id/data pair in some `Map<number, UInt8Array>`.
   * Of course, when `Microsoft.JSInterop.ts` is later deserializing JSON, it can react to `{ __dotNetByteArray: 123 }` by removing the corresponding instance from the map and supplying it.
   * This naturally cleans up after itself *as long as .NET never throws during JSON serialization*. If it does, then the JS side might never remove some of these `Map` entries, but I don't think that's a big problem because (1) people shouldn't have exceptions during JSON serialization, and if they do, then normally the user's session will be terminated anyway, and (2) JS memory isn't as security-critical like .NET memory is for Blazor Server, and (3) if this ends up being a concern in the long run, we could set up some timer-based thing on the JS side to clean up any entries that haven't been consumed after some timeout.
 * For the JS-to-.NET direction, the exact same technique could be used, with a couple of minor variations.
   * `Microsoft.JSInterop.ts` would respond to seeing a `UInt8Array` by immediately calling some new function `DotNetCallDispatcher.supplyByteArray(index: number, data: UInt8Array)`. Each runtime platform would plug in some way of transporting the data and calling `DotNetDispatcher.SupplyByteArray` on the .NET side. Note that in this direction, the IDs can be call-specific indices (i.e., restarting at `0` for each call). This is safe because JS-side serialization is always singlethreaded, synchronous, and not-user-extensible, and is always synchronously followed by the actual invocation of .NET code, so we know there's always a continuous series of synchronous `supplyByteArray` calls that synchronously precede the `beginInvokeDotNet` or whatever it's called.
   * `DotNetDispatcher.SupplyByteArray` would track the incoming data in some `JSRuntime`-instance-specific `List<byte[]>`. For security, it would need to impose a rule that you can't supply too much data in total before the actual JS interop call that consumes the data. I'd recommend we have a rule that says the total byte length of all the `SupplyByteArray` calls cannot exceed the configured SignalR ""max message size"", just so there isn't an extra thing to configure.
   * Of course, the `JSRuntime` would also have a converter that sees incoming `{ __jsByteArray: 3 }`-type values and looks up the corresponding entry in the `List<byte[]>`. Finally, before dispatching the call into user code, it would empty out the `List<byte[]>` because we know it's now finished. It could also empty out that list each time it sees an incoming `index == 0`, in case any errors caused previous processes to be left incomplete.
   * The .NET side automatically keeps itself tidy and resilient to any leaks due to failure, because it never holds more bytes than ""max signalR message size"" and always empties the storage at the start of each new call. It doesn't have to worry about overlapping calls because that just isn't possible in this direction (the serialization and sending of messages is synchronous on the JS side). If it receives too much data, or out-of-order data, it can immediately just throw and let the circuit be torn down.

Sorry this was such a huge dump of ideas - just trying to be specific to avoid wasting any of your time. If any of it seems wrong, needs clarification, or you can think of any improvements, let me know! The main benefits of this kind of approach are that we avoid all the difficulties about threading/overlaps, plus we don't need to make any changes to the majority of the layers in the API (e.g., all the `BeginInvoke`/`EndInvoke`/etc method signatures wouldn't have to be changed at all). Does this make sense?"

e1 -> e3.

e2 and e4 will be skipped since internal is smaller than min interval. 

losing e2 is fine, but e4 is problematic since the user now sees the wrong status until the next event comes in. for example, it shows ""Evaluating"" when it is actually ""Paused"" until the next event.

what _resettableDelay does is making sure that if the next event doesn't come in within 200ms, it updates status to e4."

"The issue was about not using CYDRAG, not CYFRAME.

According to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getsystemmetrics CYDRAG is:

This allows the user to click and release the mouse button easily without unintentionally starting a drag operation. If this value is negative, it is subtracted from above the mouse-down point and added below it. 

I think CYDRAG was the wrong metric. It has nothing to do with the window frame. What we want is probably CYSIZEFRAME (at least according to the doc):
>The thickness of the sizing border around the perimeter of a window that can be resized, in pixels. SM_CXSIZEFRAME is the width of the horizontal border, and SM_CYSIZEFRAME is the height of the vertical border.

Im happy to do your job (coding correct  Xamarin fixes) as soon as Microsoft is paying me for that.

At the moment I think it’s sufficient (for me) that I give you an adequate example (which even other developers were able to adopt).
And that you, who gets payed by MS with the significant of money people are paying for VS subscriptions are providing professional fixes.

But apparently I’m wrong with my assumption, as everybody can see at the desolate quality of Xamarin forms.

"Lookup via `GlobalizationResolveDllImport` should be conditional on `strcmp(new_scope, ""libSystem.Globalization.Native"")`, otherwise there is a chance of matching a method from a wrong lib if it happens to have the same name as one in Globalization. It is highly unlikely though.

Folding the `GlobalizationResolveDllImport` lookup into handling of `QCall` does not seem right though, especially since there are further plans for QCall code. 

I think I will just add the following:

```c
#if defined(ENABLE_NETCORE) && !defined(NO_GLOBALIZATION_SHIM)
	if (strcmp(new_scope, ""libSystem.Globalization.Native"") == 0) {

That is why my mind went back to the semantic model provider solution. It's putting the control, the policy, etc ... for an IDE cache in the hands of the IDE team.

What we have here is a fix for the build failure, but the fix *appears to me* to only be solving the *symptoms*.

The underlying condition doesn't make sense to me.

[This comment](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/5477#issuecomment-756787120) suggests that the ""problem"" is that if `@(AndroidJavaLibrary)` contains an entry that contains `..\`, then the referenced file is *skipped*

> AndroidJavaLibraries
>     C:\Users\user\.nuget\packages\xamarin.androidx.annotation\1.1.0.8\buildTransitive\monoandroid90\..\..\jar\androidx.annotation.annotation.jar

> ```

This is *bananas*.  *Even if true*, the inability to use `..\` to pull in associated resources is *wrong*, particularly in a world of multi-targeting!  Do we *want* to have a separate copy of `androidx.annotation.annotation.jar` *per Target Framework Moniker within the NuGet package*?  (No!)

Plus, I don't personally understand *how* it could be true: the `<CreateManagedLibraryResourceArchive/>` *copies* the contents of `@(AndroidJavaLibrary)` into `OutputDirectory`:

https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/597e7169b069eff781d8f29ddb7746b719d7f781/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Tasks/CreateManagedLibraryResourceArchive.cs#L93-L95

…except now I see how it *can* be true: line 95 has a [`Path.Combine()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.path.combine?view=net-5.0#System_IO_Path_Combine_System_String_System_String_), which returns the *second parameter* if the second parameter is an absolute path.

In this case we *know* that the second parameter will be an absolute path, meaning line 95 is equivalent to:

```csharp
MonoAndroidHelper.CopyIfChanged (item.ItemSpec, item.ItemSpec);
```

which is a no-op; the file isn't copied.

Because the `@(AndroidJavaLibrary)` files are never copied into `OutputDirectory`, no files are added to `__AndroidLibraryProjects.__.zip`, and because no files are added, we get the MSB3375."

Long answer

* Apple's macro are often incomplete or incorrect (e.g. wrong version)
  * Some (not all) gets fixed in newer betas or the next Xcode...
* There are assumptions like
  * old (pre 9.0) iOS API are assumed to be available on tvOS 9 (first version) unless decorated otherwise
  * old (pre 13) iOS API are assumed to be available on MacCatalyst 13 (first version) ...
  * enums are not always decorated since they are not API (you can see which API uses them to know which attributes are needed)
* Intro (runtime) and xtro (build time) will spot many, but not all, errors
* over time you get to know the API/framework and can identify things that looks unusual (and add tests to confirm your gut feelings)"

"@github that's only on down-level OS's.  On Win10 we don't require it.  In 3.x we had [issues](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/37) related to this with regards to new WPF native components.  WPF is special due to the C++/CLI but they also had a dependency in the native components.  Pretty much any time we add a new native component to the stack we get this wrong and see a bunch of feedback from customers around this, so it'd be good to consider removing the dependency.  I can dig up some pointers.

Even taking .NETCore out of the picture, It's an anti-pattern to have a NuGet package with a pre-requisite on a machine-wide install.  If possible that should be avoided.  

To be clear, I am fine with this change, but I think the ICU build should consider building in a way similar to the rest of .NETCore native binaries so as to not introduce new dependencies."
"I can't figure out what is wrong with fp-ts -- it fails on 3.8 and fails even when I go back to an fp-ts commit from Feb 4. I guess we weren't reporting this before somehow. 

The actual error seems like a straightforward failure in inference:

```ts
export function getOption<A>(arb: fc.Arbitrary<A>): fc.Arbitrary<Option<A>> {
  return fc.oneof(getNone(), getSome(arb))
}
```

In which `getNone(): fc.Arbitrary<Option<unknown>>` but the author desired it to be `getNone(): fc.Arbitrary<Option<A>>` to match the type of `getSome(arb): fc.Arbitrary<Option<A>>`. Adding an explicit type argument is a workaround: `getNone<A>()`.

"I re-read #38162 and the preceding bugs. The core problem is that that `in`-narrowing is guaranteed to be wrong a lot in the most common use case (optional properties), regardless of whether it's in an intersection. Without `missing` in the type system, we're just choosing whether to be wrong-strict or wrong-permissive.

Switching between the two is (1) probably not possible or worthwhile because of backward compatibility (2) a separate issue from making the feature work with intersections. I think this PR is ready to go as-is."

On the other hand, the base class - derived class boundary turns out to be a super productive bug farm, I have been poring over the code for more than a week by now and I still cannot claim I exactly know what's happening in each situation, especially as there are multiple code paths involved for explicit / sequential / auto layouts for reference types vs. value types with side fun regarding the ARM32 offset bias. As I believe that ""usefulness"" of this fixup is basically preventively diagnostic (we detect upfront that we got it wrong), I tend to believe that the base field offset calculation does constitute a value worth validating (in the intra-bubble scenario) as getting that wrong indicates a potentially critical bug in our implementation."

"I did more testing on macOS and verified that it gets both: not enough entries and too many.

Because of the wrong estimation on count, we return fewer items than we should. It can get worse as we check provided buffer size agains lover number but then we iterate  through all returned items, possibly writing to random memory. 

Now, we also return too many items. The sysctl returns all UDP sockets even not binded and/or connected. 
I added simple check to weed that down. It is imprecise as there is really not ""listening"" state on UDP. 
But I tested the outcome and compared to `netstat` on both platforms and it looks reasonable.
Returning

```

"@github/ncl PTAL

The change boils down to adding a `lock` when:
- The values in `HeaderStoreItemInfo` are being parsed (so its fields are being modified)
- The values are read from `HeaderStoreItemInfo` (non-validated reads / copying to a new header collection).

---

Since a value entry can transition from being a `string` to a `HeaderStoreItemInfo`, and we're not locking at those sites, it is expected that a single raw value may end up being parsed multiple times.
Such parsing is idempotent, so this is transparent to the user.

The code also has to be careful when reading the value of a given entry.
For example, the following logic would be problematic:
```c#
if (entries[i].Value is HeaderStoreItemInfo)
{
    // ...
}
else
{
    DoSomething((string)entries[i].Value); // Wrong! The value may now be HeaderStoreItemInfo
}
```
and it should instead be something like
```c#
object value = entries[i].Value;
if (value is HeaderStoreItemInfo)
{
    // ...
}
else
{
    DoSomething((string)value);
}
```

I've looked through our current code to make sure this is the case, but it's possible future changes may accidentally break this. I've added a test that should catch most such mistakes, but there may be cases that aren't covered."
"I removed this from the regular MAUI template because:

1. I don't even see it used
2. It seems wrong anyway because the 'replaces' text below doesn't seem to make sense

If I've misunderstood this, I will happily add it back. (And also add it to the Blazor template.)"
"I made the two constructors internal because I'm not aware of a reason for them to be public. It's used across all the supported platforms via shared source.

If I'm wrong, I'm happy to change this back. However we've changed the parameter list several times now, so it suggests we'll keep changing it in the future, and maintaining back-compat if it's a public API could become very messy."
"Also to make the context for this more clear: This API is used to generate view transform information. All of the methods that call it are internal, and it's used by XAML Hot Reload. 

If the math is still wrong (which I don't _think_ it is) it shouldn't affect any users applications, since nothing MAUI specific actually touches this."
"My personal preference would be *not* to have this overload, and thus require people to specify the `selector` argument explicitly. Reasoning:

1. If people don't realise we are inferring a selector, they will get the wrong impression about how the DOM gets populated. They will probably think that `<app>` in their `Index.cshtml` is actually a usage of a Razor Component, since it is almost the same syntax.
2. Pretty soon we'll probably change `Index.cshtml` so that the `<app>` goes inside some kind of container, or maybe `<app>` remains as the container but we change the name of the root component from `App` to `Root` or something. This is going to be needed so that `<app>` remains in the output so we know where to inject the client-rendered content to replace the server-prerendered content. At this point, you'd have to specify `selector` anyway and the existence of the other overload would primarily just be a way of getting confused.

@github If you feel strongly about keeping the overload without `selector`, then so be it, but my preference would be to drop it."
This logic *could* be moved to ValidateRequest but it felt wrong to do it there. I'm fine either way..
Is there any way this could be determined automatically based on the rendermode on the `<component>` tag? Would be nice if we could avoid the risk of customers picking the wrong option and getting confused.
"I was wrong about this instance being shared, but I've found a few more shared that I'll flag."
We could go crazy here and make figure out the suggestion based on the context (you could even do a codefix).
"A reasonable suggestion given that's what we did before.

But, the intent can be made more obvious by excluding all of `$(RuntimeTransportReferenceDirectory)*.dll` instead of the `@(_ReferencedRuntimeRefAssemblies)` subset. The double-exclusion just looks wrong and that's why I wanted to remove it. Will try my approach and fall back to your suggestion if that fails."
"StatusCodePagesFeature is a public class, so if we were to change it, we'd have to make it continue to work as it does today when called with the empty constructor. I think it might be worthwhile to just use a new internal IStatusCodePagesFeature that lazily reads the endpoint.

The only thing I don't like is locking in the wrong value for Enabled if the property is read before UseRouting(). You could definitely argue it's no worse than today where it's locked in immediately when the feature is added, but that feels a little less surprising. I wonder if it'd be better to avoid negative caching unless the property is explicitly set, but maybe that's even more surprising."
"The codefix updates the shipping file as intended. For some reason our team insists it is wrong thing to do: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/31076#discussion_r598208196 even those these files exist solely for the benefit of the tool. 🤷🏽 "

"I wouldn't do the ""first one that works"", since that arguably requires an N*M matching to find sanity.

Any of

"Yes, this is incorrectly assigning the wrong constant value number.  I found similar code

"The problem with #25570 was the removal of all the other fonts, caused by [Chromium bug 724393](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=724393) which is marked as wontfix. That's why I kept the old font stack after `system-ui` — it was cited as the fix for that issue in #26912.

I'm fine with limiting this change to Linux since that's where it affects me, but it's nice to be consistent across platforms in case someone wants to change the system font on another OS. Even without a custom system font, using `system-ui` on Windows helps fix the wrong font being used for Latin characters if the language is set to Chinese, as I demonstrated above.

I suspect there are probably similar cases of this fixing incorrect fonts with other languages and possibly even on macOS, though I haven't tested that."
"Hmm, I'm somewhat confused here - you're disabling the test on x86 yet you changed the <code>Size</code> of the <code>StructLayout</code> attribute on <code>ExplicitlySizedStructAuto</code> - does that mean that the previous value was wrong or is the change from 0x14 to 0x18 supposed to be more stressful? I don't think it's a big deal, it just comes as a surprise why you need to modify a test you're disabling for the ""new x86 scenario"" you're adding."
"the construction of this sentence will be wrong in most languages.

There is no general sentence structure that can support ""Move focus left"" and ""Move focus previous"" at the same time. Especially not in another language, right?

This is different from how we handled other commands, where we said (something like) `Move focus: direction=previous`. That looks like a straight parameter substitution.

This is different . . . it needs its own complete command string, ""Move focus to last-used pane"" or something."
"> not sure whether it is going to work for proc file system.

This is a good point. I just realized that during ""reading the stream and counting the length, allocating, then re-reading from pos:0"" the data might get overwritten by the OS and we may end up with wrong size. If that is the case, in order to avoid it, we would still need to maintain the loop-until structure. I am not sure if /proc/[pid]/* files can be read atomically, but with current implementation the risk seems to be lower."

How about we skip all of the fastdev stuff (e.g GetPrimaryCpuAdi etc) when we do the publish work flow? If the intention there is to only produce a release package I'm sure there are a ton of targets we can just not run in that scenario. 

"
"That's a good point. I suppose I thought `launchMode` was a good example of a property whos value already made initalPosition ignored, but I guess I'm wrong about that.

So `initialPosition`+`centered:true` is ""I want it to be centered _on this monitor_"", and that makes sense to me"
"If you show the warning after (successfully) loading the assembly without debug symbols, you won't end up showing the warning if there's something else wrong with the assembly (in which case it would be confusing)."
"This looks wrong, this target does nothing? If so, it can be removed."
"Correct me if I am wrong regarding why the check for `!isValidVectorIndex` is needed. 
If we are past the importer phase (where the JIT checks for validity of `indexOp` and `inde
xOp` was not const at that time) but later it became constant (say after constant propagation) we will still generate code for checking the value of `indexOp` validity during running time and presumably this should abort the execution if the value was out of range."

"> Adding test SemanticModelOnReceiver (looks good)

I debugged through the test. It looks to me that we definitely need to follow up on this. Since nothing appears to be obviously broken, a separate PR should be fine. Here is what is going wrong. As I suspected, we do not cache node for the receiver when we bind statement containing the element access. Therefore, we don't find a bound node for it on the first attempt. So we bind the containing statement again and still don't find the corresponding bound node in the map. Then we go into an error recovery mode and bind the receiver on its own. Besides utilizing the error recovery mode, we end up with a map that is inconsistent. For the containing element access we have a bound node that uses different node for the receiver. That is likely to create problems, if not today, then in the future.   "
Coding style is wrong in this function.
"That tools looks pretty amazing!

Its mere existence makes me vote towards having the templates use our own coding style (in which case the coding style is wrong in some of the new files - I guess you could run `dotnet format` locally in the template directory and that'll fix it 😄 )

"
A bunch of types were in the wrong namespaces.  Fixed that up as part of this PR.
"Is this needed? If so, I am not sure this is correct because it is a ""move constructor"" so resetting the value to `1` seems wrong."
"Ah oops, I got the order wrong when I checked the failure"
"I noticed that we have the wrong opcode for this and compensate for it in the emitter for some reason, so I have fixed this as well."
"Did you remove the wrong rule? CA1813 exists in this list below.
"
"What do you think about returning `string?` here and adding `!` in the callers where we know it's going to be non-null?   It feels wrong to say we never return NULL here when it's actually pretty common for CodeBase to be null on wasm, for example."
"This change doesn't feel right. The bound node is associated with a particular syntax, that syntax should be used to cache the node. If the node is associated with wrong syntax, it would be better to change binding to use the right syntax for the node. 
"
"I was just thinking about it in the wrong way, I was basically thinking about:
```c#
partial class A
{
    public static partial global::System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex MyRegex() => GeneratedClassForA.Instance;
}

partial class B
{
    public static partial global::System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex MyRegex() => GeneratedClassForB.Instance;
}
```

But I now understand that the Generated class that holds the types with the instances is the same for all regexes, and the name of those inner types are just the method name without includding original containing type name (in my example, `A` or `B`)"
"The comment is wrong, the type for `TNext` is inferred from the iterator of `[]`."
"i personally hate optional parameters in our internal APIs.  Because now it's not clear to me at the callsite that we're depending on default values, and it's too simple too accidently get the wrong behavior.  Can you make these required?
"
"it's wrong either way. this should be an unsigned comparison.  

The type of `table_info_get_rows` should be changed to `uint32_t`, I think. (I'm not sure what I was thinking when i made it `int`. sorry about that)"
"I had tried to follow your recomendations up and It seemed like working well, but then I did SPMI replay and it highlighted an assertion failure. I'm stuck with it and can't figure out why it keeps showing up. The issue is:
`Assertion failed 'OperIs(GT_NOP, GT_CALL, GT_COMMA) || OperIsCompare() || OperIsLong() || OperIsSimdOrHWintrinsic() || IsCnsVec()' in 'BlockingConfig:.cctor()' during 'Lowering nodeinfo' (IL size 251; hash 0x0bf431ba; Tier0)`
It goes away if I exclude TYP_SHORT from the optimization. Is there any way to force JitDump or anything helpfull for debugging during spmi replays? 
I would love to learn how you debug such replay failures and figure out what is wrong with the new code :) "
"I'm probably approaching this the wrong way, but how do I remove all nodes in one sequence of nodes and add a series of nodes in the position of the first node in the sequence of removed nodes?
"
"I see that this is a pattern copied from ILLink so I don't expect it to be fixed here, but I'm not a big fan of code handling impossible states. They tend to hide bugs and make root causing bugs a lot harder.

Two things here:
* We ""handle"" situation when `Nullable<T>` doesn't have exactly one generic argument.
* We ""handle"" when the instantiation argument is something bogus (null) - by unnecessarily using a non-exhaustive switch instead of a simple if/else.

I see this pattern in many places so I'm not going to comment on them, but it's something worth re-evaluating in the linker repo. Code that crashes when it hits invalid state is a lot easier to work with than code that papers over it and then crashes later (or worse - produces invalid outputs). We have zero test coverage for this invalid state handling.

A lot of the invalid state handling (not this one in particular) also seems to be forced by nullable reference types - I assume it wasn't easy to make something non-null so now we have code handling an impossible null scenario. Honesly, I would prefer hitting a NullReferenceException. Those exceptions are super easy to debug and often can be debugged from nothing but a stack trace. Complex code taking wrong turns is everything but easy to debug.

In the maxim ""if I can't cover a branch in testing, the branch shouldn't exist"". The null propagating operator `?.` is a branch too. We use them very liberally in this codebase. Many of those uses look as questionable as the question mark."
Seems like the tests are in the wrong file? This is not testing `DefaultJsonTypeInfoResolver`.
"I sort of misspoke, it'd still be in the function you just edited because that's the one that's checking a class declaration, it's just that you need to check for other wrong parent node types. Or, the other way around in that maybe the fix is to error if the parent is not a block or something."
"Actually, this check is wrong and the tests reflect that. Should it be

```suggestion
                        if ((moduleKind !== ModuleKind.ES2022 && moduleKind !== ModuleKind.ESNext && moduleKind !== ModuleKind.System && !(moduleKind < ModuleKind.Node16 && getSourceFileOfNode(node).impliedNodeFormat === ModuleKind.ESNext)) || languageVersion < ScriptTarget.ES2017) {
```"
"1. I don't see anything wrong with the integration with my changes.
2. You did however miss handling the logic in `FilterNamedIntrinsicMethodAttribs` in zapinfo.cpp. That will have some effect on the crossgen of System.Private.CoreLib, but I wouldn't expect it to actually break things, just to make applications run inexplicably slower than necessary."
"This question is apparently relevant to the OOMing test, because apparently variance probing in _one_ direction was working, because there were no baseline changes and no OOMing when I restricted my change to _both_ directions being unmeasurable. But, it feels like that must mean our analysis of the assignability in that test is either wrong, or only coincidentally right. Because what the current state of my PR is showing us is that at least one direction of variance probing on these types is inconclusive, but we’ve previously believed we know what the variance is, and were using that instead of structural comparisons to decide the assignability of `List<T>` to `List<U>`. That _must_ mean we have a bug, right? (Well, we obviously do because it’s mentioned in [varianceMeasurements.errors.txt](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/45578/files/8194a58d5064a451f6634836cf161668c33cd38d#diff-05d57eee4d438086a29ea51e2d54ce88839536d53e66e9ded8e3edc80e4a0004)—I assume that’s the bug I’m describing)."
"Hmm. I had tested that the build had ran, but I wonder if something else broke. I'll look at my build to see which libclrjit was used.

For the crossgen issue, I wonder if it generated armhf code. On most armv7 systems, that will compile and run, other then the fact interop code will receive parameters in the wrong spot. Console.WriteLine likely ends up being a native call, so this wouldn't shock me. "
as expected x86 does not use it currently and x64 uses only for simd16. The types were wrong for x64 but they were not used.
"This seems wrong, I think you only need to invert once."
"Between here and the Interlocked.Exchange below, it is possible for you to have multiple threads executing the code in this region.  I assume that's ok?  I can't think of anything that could go wrong as a result, but wanted to highlight it."
"I'm not a fan of these unit tests, in my opinion they are testing the wrong thing. 

Why not check that correct data is written to the stream when calling GetMemory() - Advance() multiple times?"
"There is a high chance that this condition can be improved. I've somewhat constructed it based on my intuition - maybe it's plain wrong. I was also unsure if I should use `filteredByApplicability` as a source here, or maybe that should be `indexingType`, or maybe even something else. Both of those still contain references to a generic `K` and maybe this is not what we want here or maybe this creates more work further down the road. So perhaps we should use a completely concrete source in this check (`'*'` in this case).

Apart from that this PR at the moment is causing 2 baselines changes:

A good news is that there are no new errors created by this PR and there are no errors that disappeared. The bad news is that those 2 specific case (which look very similar, so perhaps this is a actually a single case) have longer errors reported. I have a hard time assessing if that's a good change or not - would love to hear out your thoughts about this.

"Thanks @github 

I've merge `master` into this PR so that I could build/test locally. Resolved some conflicts with use-site diagnostics changes. The commit before the merge is https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/26337/commits/bd63fafab7893576c95c96419bd2d7645730cbe8 (in case something goes wrong and we need to reset in some way).
I've added a commit with tests for scenarios I still had questions about (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/8512954b3c884b91313b2c214fdbfa112fdc62d9).
Things look good.

The PR is not in a reviewable state until the feature branch is refresh (ie. https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/51424 is merged).

Crazy thought... could it be possible that the test expects the user to be vsagent? The new pools use **cloudtest** and the error says `No User exists for cloudtest`
"@github, it's precisely the file/dir distinction that prevented me from rolling out `existsSync` more broadly.  It's possible we can add try-catches for the rare cases where the wrong type is found, but it seemed likely to be a pervasive change.

As an alternative, I've proposed a change to node itself: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/33716"
"Main's corelib is 9.63 Mb (R2R'd)

- `ExtendedDefaultPolicy` without taking PGO into account: 9.83 Mb
- `ExtendedDefaultPolicy` with PGO `JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=10`: 10.10 Mb
- `ExtendedDefaultPolicy` with PGO `JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=0`: 10.17 Mb

`JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=10` means we're fine that inliner won't inline anything in cold blocks (call-sites with real profiles)
`JitExtDefaultPolicyProfTrust=0` means it doesn't affect the BenefitMultiplier anyhow for cold blocks (so we still can inline calls in them). By default, I use `5` as a balance.

Here is the jit-diff (PMI mode) without taking PGO into account: https://gist.github.com/EgorBo/8e44063324ec21ba29c636a79d7e871c

### Improvements
Most of the size improvements come from ""don't inline anything in BBJ_THROW blocks"", e.g.:
```csharp
if (x == null)
    throw new ArgumentNullException(SR.InvalidArgument); // get_InvalidArgument() is inlined here
```
both `ArgumentNullException.ctor` and `get_InvalidArgument` aren't inlined anymore. A good example is  `LowLevelLifoSemaphore:ReleaseCore(int):this` diff: https://www.diffchecker.com/Wlfl2Lde
***
There are some interesting examples where inlining leads to smaller size, e.g. 
```csharp
static GCHandle Test(object? value) => GCHandle.Alloc(value);
```
Diff: https://www.diffchecker.com/kCYnyUge
^ Inliner managed to detect foldable branches in the `GCHandle`'s constructor and inlined it, see [here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/fc4a42746d9cf65ad3db4074207069ab9c168bc9/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/InteropServices/GCHandle.cs#L62) and its [ctor](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/fc4a42746d9cf65ad3db4074207069ab9c168bc9/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/InteropServices/GCHandle.cs#L32-L54).
***
Another example - it's now able to inline `string.Equals` when we compare literals, e.g. `if (strArg.Length == 0)` is recognized as a foldable branch due to the fact we can now recognize 'get_Length' call, example:
```csharp
bool foo(string str) => str == ""hello"";

bool test() => foo(""hello"");
```
Diff for `test`: https://www.diffchecker.com/vPVxpDl1
***
There are some diffs due to PMI trying to instantiate `Vector<T>` with unsupported T (e.g. char) and inliner helpes here too, e.g. https://www.diffchecker.com/ElRZpnyh
***
`GC:AllocateArray(int,bool):ref` is smaller after inlining: https://www.diffchecker.com/AZKH3aiG
***
Same for `ASCIIUtility:NarrowUtf16ToAscii(long,long,long):long`: https://www.diffchecker.com/yS7ttpfS
***
Same for `HillClimbing:GetWaveComponent` https://www.diffchecker.com/iXaeRtBj
***
Same for `DiyFp:GetBoundaries(int,byref,byref):this` https://www.diffchecker.com/jkjH7mRo
***

***
Misc: https://www.diffchecker.com/olDdSxqM, https://www.diffchecker.com/XddHJSrd, https://www.diffchecker.com/3I81EWAo
***
There are cases where ExtendedDefaultPolicy doesn't inline what was inlined by the previous inliner - I tried to avoid it, but there were cases where I'm not sure we should inline, e.g this call https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/Directory.cs#L63 is inlined despite being quite complex: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/Common/src/System/IO/FileSystem.Attributes.Windows.cs#L25-L35
Old inliner detected here ""arg feeds const test"" and added a big multiplier. It did so because IL scan was not quite accurate and had many false positives. However, this method will still be inlined with PGO (and I am sure we have one for this in the static profile we ship). **UPD** I slightly added some boost in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/52708/commits/05a19e57d879bf9ba9d271a7bfb8efeb2b97c58c.

## Size regressions
These are the cases where inlining increases the size but hopefully for better performance.
```
        2846 (357.54% of base) : System.Private.CoreLib.dasm - Array:Sort(Array,Array,int,int,IComparer)
```
InlineTree diff: https://www.diffchecker.com/nEAcbTWc It decided to inline `ArraySortHelper.IntrospectiveSort` here (e.g. because of ""non-generic code calls generic"").
***
```

```
Diff https://www.diffchecker.com/KgWTWBug - it inlined all `HexToChars` calls.

Overall I don't see anything terribly wrong so far (e.g. terrible spills because of too-many-locals), I spent the whole week on fixing the regressions and now it's more or less fine.
Performance benefits aren't as good as they used to be with a way more aggressive inliner but I'm going to investigate what exactly led to such improvements and send separate PRs. At least currently I don't see any impact on ""time to first request"", I'll publish the first results once my [script](https://gist.github.com/EgorBo/a1ab453bf41a5369aa54b4c4fba6bea5) finishes.

@github you can pick any method from the jit-diff and I'll explain with the diffs what exactly happened."

"I think a lot of the recent and upcoming C# language features get one fundamental thing wrong (in my personal opinion).

They optimise for writing code, not for reading code. I think it should be the opposite.

@github has shown a great number of examples throughout this conversation how `!!` substantically improves writing certain fragments of code, but in all those cases I found that it was *much harder* to read and grok that code afterwards.

Writing a few extra lines of if statements is not that hard and especially in .NET it's a minuscule problem given that  most IDEs already write it for me at the tip of a few key strokes followed by a double `TAB` stroke.

I would encourage developers at Microsoft to ask themselves how open they actually are to community feedback like this. I don't mean to suggest anything bad, but personally I often get the feeling that by the time a feature like this gets revealed for feedback a lot of investment (time and emotion) has already gone into developing a (more or less polished) prototype of it at which point people already have a personal investment in defending their decisions and have a bias towards downplaying good counter arguments as ""minority noise""."

"srandom is there to set the random generator seed based on the current time so that the random offset of executable memory allocations is not always the same (this code is invoked just once at process startup).
I think there is nothing wrong with random, the point was that we needed to differentiate between Illumos and other unixes we already support as its RAND_MAX is set to 0x7fff and it doesn't apply to the random() output (it does for rand() only). And since the arcrandom has a function that doesn't have to care about the RAND_MAX, it seemed like a clean replacement.

> iOS bottom tabs only support solid brush (still looking for a workaround here)

Hmmm yea that's annoying. Figuring out what will and won't work across platforms with brushes has been a fun journey.
 
I took a brief stab at figuring out how to let users supply custom UIViews for UITabs because iOS really locks this down and I found that you can do something like this inside `ShellItemRenderer`

```C#
CustomTabBar _customTabBar;
		public override void ViewDidLoad()
		{
			base.ViewDidLoad();

			_customTabBar = new CustomTabBar();
			this.SetValueForKey(_customTabBar, new NSString(""tabBar""));
```

```C#
		class CustomTabBar : UITabBar
		{

		}
```

And then iOS will render your `CustomTabBar`
I don't know if this helps you at all but I was pretty excited when I found these hooks

IMO it should work for most to all types that support the subscript operator, such like random-access iterators, C-arrays, and pointers. We should accept signed index types because iterators and pointers support negative offsets. And we should avoid to cast the passed index to `ptrdiff_t` or `size_t` because the expected type size might be smaller. E.g. `winrt::hstring::size_type` is always `uin32_t`.

"I just tried `{0}` and it doesn't seem to change anything unfortunately.

Please note that Chromium and Firefox don't have a solution.

Chromium [doesn't do it correctly either](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=950362). It just ""ignores"" the ""Title bars and window borders"" setting for the top border so it always paint the border with the accent color. And in that case, there is no transparency (I think) so that is correct but it shouldn't paint the border with the accent color in the first place:

"I don't think we should allow an `this[int, params)` indexer to fulfill the requirements for a type being ""indexable"".
See existing behavior for implicit Index indexing:

public class C

    public int this[int i, params string[] o] => 0; // this type isn't indexable because this indexer has the wrong signature
    public int Length => 0;
    public void M()

"So the nice part of having rsp files and putting args in separate lines is that you technically don't need to quote them.

Less so in specialized cases, but if you could avoid it, it's definitely worth looking in to."
"> I think I realize now, that making `VTInt` a signed integer might've been a mistake...

Why's that? I actually thought a signed int was the right choice. As an example, if you're working with VT coordinates, a typical calculation would be to add or subtract an offset, and then clamp the result within the active margins or buffer range. If that intermediate offset goes negative on a signed int that's not a problem - it's still going to clamp correctly. But if it's unsigned, it's going to wrap, and you're going to end up with the wrong result.

> If we need these two new color functions to be performant, we could use a LUT for mapping 0-100 to 0-255.

I like that idea. I am keen to get these functions as fast as possible, mostly for when they're used in sixel. Although HLS colors aren't likely to be used much, so the HLS one is less critical.

> That wouldn't just work for `ColorFromRGB100` but also for `ColorFromHLS` which can be written with integer arithmetic only (without integer division).

I've done some initial experiments with a LUT, and it's a big improvement for `ColorFromRGB100`, but in `ColorFromHLS` it actually seems somewhat slower. It could just my badly written code, but I went with the floating point implementation in the first place because I found it faster than my integer version, and I suspect the LUT doesn't make up for that loss.

I'll play around some more and see if I can improve things, otherwise I'll just do the LUT for `ColorFromRGB100`."

"> it sounds like you want to loosen the restriction in place:

I guess so. Since you can replicate those situations in cases where we do not issue an error (eg, via variadic concatenation), I think having accurate behavior for them is important. And thus, once you have accurate behavior for those situations, there's not much of a justification in forbidding them in normal circumstances, I think.


> How often do we leverage the distinction between optional and potentially undefined when we have the property itself?

Infrequently. In fact, that we don't is pretty much one of the reasons for https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/41418 being a bug and not ""intended behavior"". So the inclusion of `undefined` in the type is potentially needed for consistency.

> For multiple rest elements...

Yeah, I just reason that sequences of types in an array aren't that different from sequences of characters (or types) in a string (or template) - so the later being strictly more powerful with respect to what is preserved through concatenation operations rubs me the wrong way a bit - I feel like we've done some of the thinking on how to match up these sequences, and should probably try to do the same here, rather than quietly losing type fidelity in an unsafe way."

    Fixes: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/44559

The reason why the tests were failing was kind of tricky. 

- We set, disable implicit references, which means Microsoft.NETCore.App is not a reference when restore happens.
- Because of that, the AppHost package is not downloaded at all, however when we targeted net5.0 for the tests, the AppHost package was found on the SDK packs directory. Now that NetCoreAppCurrent moved to net6.0, it does add the AppHost package to `PackageDownload` but it never downloads it because there are no FrameworkReferences when ProcessFrameworkReferences is executed. 
- The fix was to move `FrameworkReference` out of the target so that the framework reference is picked up by restore and the runtime packs are downloaded correctly.
- Also I removed the `RuntimePack` from `PackageDownload` to not download un necessary stuff.

I validated that we still build and publish using the local built runtime and ref packs:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22899328/99005190-33d33800-24f5-11eb-8994-4bd76c05fcf3.png)

I also did some cleanup to use the `MicrosoftNETCoreAppVersion` property instead of hardcoding the version in the `KnownFrameworkReference` and `KnownAppHostPack`.

When trying to run an individual project I noticed that the way we were invoking `dotnet` was wrong because we were using `DotNetRoot` which is empty if arcade is using the globally installed SDK so we were resolving `TestDotNetPath` to the test project path... I changed it to use `DotNetTool` which is handled by arcade: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/4873d157a8f34f8cc7e28b3f9938b32c642ef542/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk/tools/RepoLayout.props#L35

"> I disabled hill climbing.

What about `DOTNET_SYSTEM_NET_SOCKETS_INLINE_COMPLETIONS`? Was it set to `1`? 

For some reason it's now the default setting for PlaintextPlatform and JsonPlatform benchmarks (I believe that it's wrong, we then have 1 epoll thread per core, not 1 per 30 cores which is the default setting that 99.9999% of our customers are using in production)). 

It can have a big impact on the benchmark results when you are changing somethinng related to `ThreadPool`. I would just feel safer about any changes if they were benchmarked with the default settings (with the exception of hill climbing on machines with many cores).

> There is a work item for fixing it in .NET 6

I am really happy to hear that! Is there a GH issue that I could follow or for now it's just somewhere in our internal docs?"
"Looks like this will not be as simple as just adding a new task that runs a .cmd instead of a .sh. The tests now failed because it was trying to pass parameters to a script with the wrong syntax.

"> I have presented a patch that allowed me to parse an entire Windows Runtime API surface with a high-level API. 

The point of this discussion is whether we are comfortable with supporting this scenario going forward. WinRT is developed independently on .NET these days.  System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext was not designed for reading .winmd files. There are scenarios today where System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext won't work well for reading .winmd files, and this set is likely to grow over time.

> It also reduces code complexity by reusing existing code and dropping generic parameter 

This simplification is definitely welcomed. Thank you!

>  I'd be interested to read about the differences between .NET type system and WinRT type system

I am not aware of comprehensive up-to-date document that lists all differences. I can give you one example: Names in assembly references are irrelevant in WinRT type system. The name in .winmd assembly references maps to correct file name some of the time. It is fragile to depend on it. The WinRT type system specifies [algorithm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/winrt-cref/winmd-files#winmd-file-name) for locating .winmd files. The runtime built-in WinRT interop support had methods like `AppDomain.TypeResolve` to support the WinRT specific algorithm for locating .winmd files. None of this support is present in System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext.

Also, I was wrong that `System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext` does not apply type projections. It does apply the type projections since `MetadataReaderOptions.Default = MetadataReaderOptions.ApplyWindowsRuntimeProjections`. However, this is the frozen snapshot of the type projections that matches the runtime built-in WinRT interop support. The set of WinRT type projections was extended since then, and so this won't work well for more recent WinRT types such like the ones that come with WinUI 3."

When creating any culture, we read the culture data from the underlying OS library (either NLS or ICU). Part of the data we read is the culture native digits. We should get ten digits string (e.g. `0123456789`). Sometime the settings in the host machine get messed up and can return digits strings less than ten digits and that can cause .NET to throw `IndexOutOfRangeException`. Such failure is hard to diagnose after the fact especially when the collected dumps don't include the machine settings. This issue gets reported every while and recently we get it again from some customer. The change here is only read the returned digits data if it is ten digits. Otherwise, we'll fallback to ASCII digits 

It is hard to add a test for such fix as it will need to change the machine settings. But, I have tested manually and ensured it address the issue when having wrong settings.

The symbols for `dotnet` and `hostpolicy` are not being published to the public Microsoft symbol servers.

It looks like we are currently relying on the symbol packages for `Microsoft.NETCore.DotNetHost` and `Microsoft.NETCore.DotNetHostPolicy` to get symbols for `dotnet` and `hostpolicy` published.

The `pkgproj` projects in installer have a `PackageReference` to `Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Packaging`: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/f7b441d6c14cfc60c2d02bdc6a087247806efb7c/src/installer/pkg/projects/Directory.Build.props#L129

That package includes a target that sets the `SymbolPackageOutputPath` based on the `PackageOutputPath`.
https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Packaging/src/build/Packaging.targets#L63

However, the targets of that package are imported _before_ the project's `Directory.Build.targets`, which imports Arcade targets that set the default for `PackageOutputPath`:
https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk/tools/ProjectDefaults.targets#L22

As a result, the symbol packages built by `src/installer/pkg/projects/*.pkgproj` end up in the wrong directory - For example, under `artifacts\bin\<project_name>\Release` instead of `artifacts\packages\Release\Shipping` - such that they do not get uploaded and published.

This was an unfortunate side effect of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/57036.

This change goes back to having `SymbolPackageOutputPath` explicitly set. It is not really intuitive / great, but given the desire to stop having these packages (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35244, which will also need to make sure symbol publishing is covered by other things) and my expectation that we should backport to 6.0, I went with the simply bringing back the previous behaviour.

When enabling the globalization invariant mode on Linux, we'll always fallback to `UTC` time zone which is wrong and a regression from .NET 5.0. We have some docker containers which enable the globalization invariant mode by default on the whole image; the problem will be obvious there.

In .NET 6.0 we have introduced the [Globalization Invariant Mode Breaking Change](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/globalization/6.0/culture-creation-invariant-mode). This breaking change causes throwing exception when enabling the globalization invariant mode and creating any culture other than Invariant culture. 
If the globalization invariant mode is enabled and trying to get the local time zone when running on Linux platform, the creation process will try to initialize the display names of the time zone. This initialization tries to reset the UI culture to `en-US` if it is set to Invariant culture. When we have the globalization invariant mode is on, the UI culture will always be Invariant and cause the time zone initialization to fallback to `en-US` which will throw exception because it is not allowed to create any other cultures in the Invariant mode. We catch the exception and then fallback to use `UTC` time zone instead of the actual time zone set on the running machine.

The fix is simple and not risky which is avoid creating any culture during time zone initialization when the globalization invariant mode is on.

Is there a follow up issue to move this to Components.Server? This looks like the wrong place for this to define this
"If these types required the option type to be specified to construct, I can see the value in having these. Requiring the caller to get the path to the temp directory from an option type before passing it in to these types seems onerous to the caller and super easy to get wrong.

"@github is rightfully concerned about us doing Razor language changes and then losing the ability to immediately verify the tooling impact of those changes. I'm not saying that it will be impossible to validate the language changes, just much, much harder than today 😄. So that being said I 100% agree with Ryan that it sucks to have that restriction.

Basically i'm juggling the following priorities in my head:
1. Optimize build times for the dotnet org
2. Optimize the manual labor of ""another repo""
3. Optimize stability for tooling specific changes (flakiness will heavily disrupt our ability to get out VS insertions)
4. Optimize speed for tooling specific changes. Re-building all of aspnetcore would not allow tooling to iterate quickly.
5. Optimize Razor language changes that also impact tooling.
6. Optimize Razor tooling only changes that do not require language changes.

As of right now we have a TON of 6 on the critical path as committed/currently being done. Hell that's a large reason why the aspnetcore/aspnetcore-tooling merge was delayed to begin with. And it goes without saying that 3 & 4 impact both language and non-language changes. Sooo all that said i'm willing to iteratively bring pieces of the aspnetcore-tooling world into AspNetCore to make the grander dotnet world better with the realization that there's pros and cons to it all. 

In an ideal world we'd ""just"" solve all of the above priorities. I haven't found a way to inexpensively do that and everything else we have planned"

Are you asking me to transcribe the CLR access rules? The only ""variable"" is how we define type and assembly identity. Assembly identity is supposed to be defined by` IAssemblySymbol.Identity` but @github points out that the compiler does it wrong. Type identity should be defined, recursively, by name and arity, and containing symbol. The rest is down to the CLR rules for the meaning of the access modes.

Yes.  But you also check for EOF.  Which i assume you can get after enter.  (If i'm wrong, def let me know... i'm really trying to understand the code, and as i've mentioned, it's not clear ot me).  

Regardless, this whole discussion is helping prove my case :)   This is complex and subtle and it is *not* clear just from looking how this is intended to work.  There are many callers for many user interaction codepaths, and there are many checks going on.  The fact that after going back and forth with you a *dozen* times, it's *still* not clear to my why this is correct, is a strong indication to me that we shoudl *make this code more clear*.

I think it would be reasonable to just nip this entire back-and-forth in the bud and just spend any energy that would have been put into a response here into just putting that effort into clarifying that code :)

At the end of the day, the best you'll be able to do is finally convince me that that code is correct.  And once that happens, we'll still just want to comment the code to help others understand.  After all, if i've spent dozens of minutes on this, and i still don't get it, i'm not sure how this will be for others who are even *less* familiar with formatting than i am.

`shutdownCode` might give users the wrong idea (thinking relation to `Socket.Shutdown`) -- QUIC spec calls it `errorCode` even when successful (`NO_ERROR`) so maybe that.

"I don't like pushing it down, except for helpers that are dedicated argument validation helpers for mutliple reasons:

1) It's not clear whether a public API is actually validating all of its arguments if it leaves it up to the methods it calls to do so.
2) When writing an internal method, how do I decide whether or not to do full argument validation? It's inconsistent and confusing if some internal methods of a type do argument validation because they happen to be called from some public API impl, but others don't because they currently aren't called from public API impl. 
3) The methods called from the public API implementation might have different argument names than the public API. They might also have more or less arguments than the public API. Throwing an argument exception with wrong argument name is not very user friendly - it defeats the purpose of having argument name on the exception.
4) Internal calls to the internal methods would do redundant argument validation.

The caller might expect a call to `KeepAlive` to behave _at minimum_ like a call to `GC.KeepAlive`.

Yeah, that matches the docs: ""Returns the number of bits in the minimal two's-complement representation of this BigInteger, excluding a sign bit."".

I think it's something like

```
int bitLen = bigInt.bitLength();
return (bitLen + 7) / 8;
```

(Might be wrong for negative numbers if it really ""excludes"" the sign bit, vs excludes the cleared sign bit for positive numbers... then `if (bigInt.signum() < 0) { bitLen++; }`)

My expectation from the docs is that positive 0xFF will report signum() as 1 and bitLength() as 8, but export in two bytes.

(8 + 7) / 8 == 15 / 8 == 1

1. `private static void ProcessAttributes(XmlReader reader, XmlConfigurationElement element)`
2. `void ProcessElementAttributes(Prefix prefix, XmlConfigurationElement element)`

The first method is invoked during the parsing stage. It reads the XML attributes from the XML document and adds instances of `XmlConfigurationElementAttributeValue` to the current `XmlConfigurationElement`

The second method is invoked during the processing stage. It produces configuration key values for each attribute.

To avoid future confusion, I have renamed `ProcessAttributes` (the first method) to `ReadAttributes`.

If I misunderstood you and it was not a matter of confusion, can you please clarify why you think that exception does not belong there?"
"The side effect is that `ReadString` advances the stream cursor. Or, put another way, your code is equivalent to the following:

private static string ReadValue(this BinaryReader reader) => reader.ReadString();
```

Which ostensibly should be equivalent to the following, because all I did was reorder the named parameters:

```cs
context._savedLicenseKeys.Add(value: reader.ReadValue(), key: reader.ReadKey());
```

However, that second example will result in the wrong entries being added to the underlying dictionary. The reason is that side effects are occuring within the underlying stream while the arguments to this method are being evaluated. Pulling the arguments out as temp variables before the method call makes the code read ""top-to-bottom"" instead of ""left-to-right"". This is generally easier for people to understand."

No, the transformation itself looks correct to me (well, there is one issue - `GTF_RELOP_JMP_USED` is not guaranteed to be maintained by this phase, so it'll have to be replaced by a check of the user's oper).

"A couple notes:

1. The failing test case is a little weird after all; the globals only show up because of the cumulative parsing weirdness that comes from the several preceding lines. My impression looking at that test was that every line was intended to be a clean parsing context. It’s valuable to ensure that a half-written statement has good completions as you’re writing it, but less so that the fourth half-written statement in a row behaves well. I would actually just split that test file up into a file per line.

2. Having an `any` or undefined contextual type is a little too restrictive. You also want to account for `object`, `unknown`, and possibly string index signatures:

    ```ts
    declare function f1(obj: unknown): void;
    declare function f2(obj: object): void;
    declare function f3(obj: Record<string, any>): void;

    declare var foo;
    f1({ /**/ });
    f2({ /**/ });
    f3({ /**/ });
    ```

    But the index signature case brings up the question of whether the types need to match up:

    ```ts
    declare const foo: string;
    const obj: { [key: string]: number } = { /* `foo` here? It would error because string is not assignable to number */ };
    ```

    On one hand, we don’t do any kind of filtering of member completions in the presence of a contextual type, but that’s more justifiable because you might dot off of one and continue the expression, resulting in a different type. More practically, it’s going to be too expensive to check the assignability of every identifier in the completions list, so I think the choice is between offering all the completions, even wrong ones, or none.

    You also want to test cases where the contextual type is a type parameter:

    ```ts
    declare function foo<T>(obj: T): T; // and another where `T extends object`, maybe `T extends {}`
    var blah: string;
    foo({ /**/ })
    ```

    I think this might Just Work once you consider `unknown` and `object` contextual types, but it’s worth testing.

"I added the MSBuild task and targets to validate that the attribute and version is correct.

At first I thought about just doing a simple validation of `ExpectedVersion` == `InformationalVersion.Substring(0, IndexOf('+'))` and error if that was false in a simple MSBuild target, however, even if `InformationalVersion` property is correct, the attribute could be wrong, since a public API relies on the attribute being correct I decided to add a task that cracked open the assembly and inspected the attribute. Please let me know if you think it is overkill to add a task and I can revert it and do it in the simple MSBuild way that doesn't crack open the attribute.

Second, I started using System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext, however, since this is an MSBuild task, I was getting:

The only way to do that was to publish instead of build the installer tasks, and that would've been more complicated since you need to specify the core library path and assembly search paths, so if we want to enable this on other projects in the future it would involve more logic.

"@github Investigating this a bit more, is there a way to avoid using TickCount/TickCount64?
The reason is that this information is not available in a minidump. DateTime.Now is available (the time the dump was written), but not TickCount/TickCount64. As a result, expressions involving TickCount won't work on dumps.
Currently, in minidumps, the VS debugger just evaluates TickCount in the current debugger context, which is wrong and instead should spew an error that we can't evaluate Environment.TickCount. DateTime.Now is also currently evaluated in the current context but that's fixable to instead plumb through the time when the minidump was collected."

My standard starting position is to ask the FDG what they have to say about it:

> DO provide good defaults for all properties and parameters (using convenience overloads), if possible.

OK, so if it's possible we should provide a good default.  So, what makes a good default in this case?  I think ""predictability"".

Let's imagine that we didn't have the parameter at all... so it's just `ResolveTarget()`, what would that do?  I feel like it would return the target value of the link... so non-recursive/non-final.  Now, in a future version, someone says ""it'd be nice if I didn't have to write the while loop myself, especially because I keep forgetting to put in an infinite loop detector"", so we add an overload.  The zero-arg version is still doing a single target resolution, because that's the method name.  The parameter then can control an ""actually, I want to keep going"" behavior.

So now lets just collapse that and look at it with a default parameter.  The name of the method is ResolveTarget.  Resolve is, admittedly, slightly ambiguous, so let's pretend it's named GetTarget.  Well, GetTarget is obviously ""give me the target value of this symlink"", so `link.GetTarget()` would be non-recursive.  To me, a similar thing applies when we let Get be called Resolve.  If we think that's where the ""but Resolve feels like it should keep going until final resolution"", then perhaps the better change is s/ResolveTarget/GetTarget, and now ""once"" is the ""obvious"" behavior, and ""keep going"" is the opt-in behavior.

The problem with recursive being the default is that it has unexpected behaviors.  If we have no work limiter, then mutually referential symlinks cause an infinite loop:

```
$ ls -al foo bar
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jbarton jbarton 3 Jul  8 09:38 bar -> foo
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jbarton jbarton 3 Jul  8 09:38 foo -> bar
```

If we do have a work limiter then mutually referential symlinks will.. do something.  Throw, return the last one it saw when it exhausted the work factor, something.  Whatever it does, you probably didn't expect it.  Sure, the docs'll mention it, but no one reads the docs until something goes wrong.

To me, from a logical perspective (of how I think about things), ""once"" is the correct default.  To me, from a security perspective (not ""hiding"" unexpected behaviors in server products), ""once"" is the correct default.  So, to me, we should just figure out what makes us happy with that choice (e.g. renaming Resolve to Get)."

"that is the issue... Application does not have a UI thread component. My initial case was to say that all bindable objects need a UI thread - like all the other platforms do, but unfortunately this breaks a lot of tests and things. We can change it later and just throw in the ctor if not on the UI thread, but that is for another PR.

However, right now if you create an object on a thread with a dispatcher, that is the thread you must stay on. If you do a background thread, then it will try find it each time and look up the UI hierarchy or fall back to Application.

It is wrong, but this is what forms did.

The correct solution is to not allow UI objects to be created off the UI thread. This should throw if null is returned: https://github.com/dotnet/maui/pull/2862/files#diff-ebb14ec14b8baeffdd7b0ae40ffc8bf0e8944f76fdea50fcbc737fb142bfb44aR24

"I don't care about it that much (It's definitely a ""you're holding it wrong"" situation IMO), but this failure mode is particularly bad."
"I could argue that the current behavior is wrong. It breaks the contract that OnAfterRender gets invoked when the batch has rendered on the target display. (In whatever form or shape that takes).

Given that the base class is not associated with any display technology and that the render never finishes, it makes sense to switch the implementation for a cancelled task.

I understand the ""obscure coupling"" argument, but I also believe that its not an obscure detail but front and center to the onafterrender contract. We've been telling developers that OnAfterRender runs when the display has been updated and references have been populated.

Our original default was wrong, because we would run it in a context where we can't actually perform a render, so returning Task.CompletedTask is bad.

My reasoning is that, Task.CancelledTask is the right thing to do because the base renderer will never complete an update and is only able to render static HTML. Derived classes provide the ability to update the display and complete a full render pass.

We also have quite a good amount of tests describing this behavior, so I'm not concerned about breaking anything without noticing.

Does ComponentContext.IsConnected change in circuits to signal disconnection? If so, I would stay away from using it for this, as we shouldn't simply avoid running the callbacks if we happen to hit !context.IsConnected

I do see your concerns but I think despite this being used to avoid running OnAfterRender callbacks, switching to Task.CancelledTask is the right thing to do for the base class, it just also happens to fix the problem.

Keep in mind that in RemoteRenderer we also cancel the completions when we dispose the RemoteRenderer, which is aligned with what this does here.

"> I see vs-threading as the writing on the wall for the eventually elimination of widespread littering of ConfigureAwait. We aren't ready to go down that road yet, but it's the target outcome.

Let's just look at this method on its own.  First, i have no idea how to reason about what thread it is actually on. It says LoadComponentsInUIContextAsync.  However, there is no assert to actualy verify that it's on the UI context.  Then, it performs a bunch of async calls that are themselves not clear to me as to their intent (though i can come aronud around to the idea that if you knwo this is JTF, you can maybe squint and view no-configure-await as being intentional).  Then, it runs code that affectively says ""if i'm not on the UI thread, bad baddy badness will occur"", but i see nothing that ensures that safety.

Because `TerminalSettings` is now a WinRT object in TerminalApp, it makes sense for TerminalApp to be responsible for synthesizing the `TerminalSettings`.

Thank you for the reply.

I am using a combination of virtualised rendering and collection views. The vertical part is done by a virtualised layout. I can play around with removing it but would rather see all scenarios supported.

Imho one of the largest drawbacks with Xamarin is that you can't just add UI components and have things work, as there's always some incompatibilities between the components. I don't think this should make its way into the main repo unless it works in all scenarios. It is not a good look if you have to rewrite your UIs several times just to find a permutation of components that works.

Also, any pointers regarding toggling a visual element, which I think is mandatory for the consumers to understand that it is a foldable element? I really think it should be doable straight in XAML.

Thanks!"

It will. See previous comment. If something is missed making your code untestable create an issue and we'll abstract and fix

My comments were specifically targeting this statement about how X.E was architected to make testing impossible which is a statement I don't understand.  I'm first just establishing that Essentials is fine and doesn't need interfaces and then we build out from there. If there's something fundamentally wrong with Essentials that will make it impossible for us then let's fix that. 

But from your most recent comments it sounds like you're totally fine with us depending on essentials and that essentials itself is fine but that we should just be careful to not break forms xplat testability. Which we will be.

So the call you added to `resolveEntityName` should probably turn into a call to `resolveJSDocMemberName`, which itself will call `resolveEntityName`.
However, it may need some improvement to work right in that location. I don't have all the details of that code in my head, I just remember that it was pretty ad-hoc."

"Not crazy about those. Regarding getTypeFromBindingElementParent, we're not actually getting the type from the element's parent, we're getting it from the corresponding property or element in the type of the value being destructured. Regarding getTypeFromBindingElementInitializer, the type comes from the initializer or, lacking one, if the element is itself a binding pattern, from the shape of that pattern and recursively from it's elements.

"@github  I'm not much sure. But per you comment (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/44667#issuecomment-637134548) and my understanding to it, this analyzer shouldn't be configurable. The `IDEDiagnosticIDConfigurationTests` is for configurable rules (As far as I understand).

Is there something that should be done inside the analyzer itself to mark it as non-configurable, so the `IDEDiagnosticIDConfigurationTests` can ignore it?

Or my understanding is totally wrong?"

This implements CFB one shots.

Some implementation notes:

1. As discovered in #55477, CFB128 and CFB64 do not work with persisted CNG keys, they always work in CFB8 mode today. Rather than replicating this wrong behavior, `AesCng` and `TripleDESCng` will throw if the key is persisted and the feedback size is other than 8. This limitation can be removed, if it is possible, when the linked issue is solved.
2. RC2 does not support CFB at all, so the implementation throws.

Closes #2406

"> Newline characters are not valid inside group name. If you try it inside a console app, you will get a RegexParseException with message : ""Invalid pattern '[regex]' Invalid group name: Group names must begin with a word character.""

Maybe it's just me doing something completely wrong but this seems to have broken workload installs in 6.0.2xx previews (using the dotnet6 feed) since there's no 6.0.1 version of Microsoft.NET.Workload.Emscripten on it. Adding the darc-pub-dotnet-emsdk-e8ffccb feed fixed it temporarily but that's probably not the best way to go about it.

We remove branch to an empty unconditional branch, in this case, it's `BB114`.

```

If you notice, `BB114` is still in the predlist of `BB116` which seems wrong. When LSRA tried to add resolution moves, it adds it inside `BB114` because it is the pred of `BB116`.

```
BB114 bottom: move V00 from STK to rsi (Join)
```

and that generates the bottom 2 instructions

```asm
       488B75D8             mov      rsi, gword ptr [rbp-28H]
       EB2F                 jmp      SHORT G_M28654_IG89
```

I was also puzzled why `BB114` doesn't get removed in the ""dead blocks removal"" phase and that's because somehow our data structure is outdated and we still think that `BB114` is reachable via `BB113` (which has been already removed), which was in the past reachable via `BB107` (as seen in the first BB blocks I pasted).


Just to summarize:
1. Remove branch to unconditional jump should remove the block from the pred list of destination block.
2. Make sure that the data structure reflects that so such blocks are eliminated in ""dead removal phase"".

I will send PR to fix them, but yes, there is lot of dead code hanging out there.

"@github it's not a dumb question.  

There are two ways of forcing default values. 

- Mandatory attribute: if missing the scripts will prompt for values.  So if you forget there is a chance your script ends up hanging Jenkins because its' waiting for info to be typed into a prompt
- Use the `[string]$foo = $(throw ...)` approach.  This is great except when the `throw` executes the script exits with a return value of 0.

this seems strange.  can we file a bug on them to not do this?  i'm ok with us being resilient to it.  it just seems wrong that some random API we're calling is throwing an operationcanceled exception when no cancellation is involved with them.
"the callback form doesn't prevent crashes.  ReplaceNode, today, fundamentally can just crash on you if you end up replacing a node that no longer exists due to a previous operation.  

i.e. say you had:

```Outer(Inner(a))```

And you do a ReplaceNode on 'Outer' (with some other node that does not include 'Inner'), then ReplaceNode on 'Inner' can crash on you regardless of which form you use (since you'll get null passed to your callback, which certainly nearly no callbacks support).

The important question is: is this a reasonable scenario where you could expect nesting or not?  In my opinion, the ```== null``` scenario is not.  So spending time on the callback form just isn't relevant.  

--

Note: i have long thought ReplaceNode should not have this behavior.  I raised that point several times over the lifetime of it, but was unable to get the change made.  The crash was felt to be helpful because it helped call out to the person that there was something wrong with their ordering, and having the editor just ignore the subsequent replacements was not appropriate."

What's wrong with this cache?
"A couple ways to answer:

1. I would expect it to: the only way that wouldn't happen is if the original state created was then modified by the addition of another document. For example, adding documents in batch is different than adding documents one-by-one. We don't have a case where that would happen and it'd be suspicious to me if that ever went wrong.
2. CreateFilePathToDocumentIdsMapWithAddedDocuments is only consuming the Id and FilePath, so even if a new instance was created, it'd be the same for the purposes of this call. This is trying to avoid creating a bunch of unnecessary allocations. The older approach where we extracted just an id/filepath pair was indeed elegant but seems a bit unnecessary."
"> The primary case where this is relevant is Fix All operations, which force full-project (or solution) analysis for analyzers even when they are marked OpenFileOnly. OpenFileOnly no longer forces in-process analysis for analyzers that are equally fine running out-of-process. However, keep in mind that the long-term goal is eliminating the need for both of these flags.

I see. so, what you are saying is all OpenFileOnly analyzer should be able to run out of proc? and for fix all, you need to run analyzers out of proc? 

if so, this condition is wrong.
var inProcResultTask = AnalyzeInProcAsync(CreateAnalyzerDriver(analyzerDriver, a => (forcedAnalysis || !a.IsOpenFileOnly(workspace)) && a.IsInProcessOnly()), project, remoteHostClient, cancellationToken);

"> ... particularly if they forget the `CheckValidInstance`

Forgetting CheckValidInstance is just wrong.  It means that InvalidOperationException wouldn't be thrown on a `default` value, which they should add a test for.  If they fail to add it, they'll get a NullReferenceException, and then the fix is to call CheckValidInstance and have the exception be thrown.

"Oh, hang on—`observe()` returns an `IQuark`, so the circularity is real and clear! It’s even called out explicitly in https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29872:

> The workaround exists - to use different form of creating the type for the standalone mixin class - with interfaces... But this notation seems to drive crazy the IDE (the language server under the hood?). It stop finding usages of properties, show many false type errors etc.

Yep, because there’s a circularity that we falsely resolve and don’t report. I think the bug is that we _don’t_ report a circularity error— the “workaround” is the bug.

And my earlier comment:

> you should be able to substitute `A` in `interface A extends B<T> {}` for `B<T>`

It turns out the simple form `B<T>` (`Mixin<typeof CQuark>` in this test case) simply resolves to `any` in this case without triggering any errors, so that doesn’t actually work either, so I feel better about this interface example being an error. (I guess in the type reference case, we detect the circularity but fail to emit a noImplicitAny error on the way back out.)"

Can you clarify why?

I can't see why the change is wrong. The [documentation for IsImplicitlyDeclared](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.isymbol.isimplicitlydeclared?view=roslyn-dotnet) states:

> Returns true if this symbol was automatically created by the compiler, and does not have an explicit corresponding source code declaration.

And that's the case with the symbol `<Program>$` (i.e. SimpleProgramNamedTypeSymbol). It is automatically created by the compiler and it's indeed doesn't have an explicit source code declaration."
"this part is interesting.correct me please if I'm wrong, here you are saying: ""As I see nobody is watching folder 'pathToWatch' so I'm going to install watcher for it. However it is possible that somebody is already watching 'pathToWatch/<some-path>'. If yes - I'm going to shutdown this watcher since watcher for 'pathToWatch' should get the same notifications"". 

If the answer is 'yes' then I'm curious how it works since by default `fs.watch` is [not recursive](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener) so if initially you had watcher for '/a/b/c/d' and then you install one for '/a/b' then after closing watcher for '/a/b/c/d' you'll receive no notifications about changes in this file

It's not as thorough as Roslyn could be, but at least it can find a few more instances. For example, it worked with this code:

```cs
    static void Main()
    {
        A?.B.D; // No
        A!.B.C!.D; // No
        A()!.B().C()!.D; // No
        A(a, b)!.B(b, c).C(c, d)?.D; // No
        A?.B!.C; // Yes
        A?.B!.C!.D; // Yes
        A!.B?.C!.D?.E; // Yes
        A()!.B()?.C().D; // Yes
        A(a)!.B(b)?.C().D; // Yes
        A(a, b)!.B(b, c)!.C.D; // Yes
    }
```
Please correct me if any of the cases is wrong."

"Hi, I want to point a small regression that I believe has been introduced by this PR 😕 Alas I haven't been able to isolate a MNWE after 1 day trying to extract code from my project and reaching 200 lines in the non so minimal and still working example 😞 

TLDR: [This project](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa) builds in TS4.5.2 but doesn't in TS 4.5.3 (nor in 4.5.5).
Given the error message and the crashing on our controlled-recursive type, I do believe that this PR is the cause of it.

We are building recursive type but controlling the recursion through a `type Depths = [-1, 0, 1, 2]` (ensuring `Depths[D] = D-1`), then the type looks like (over simplified) `type Nested<T, D extends number = 3> = D extends -1 ? T : Nested<T, Depths[D]>`. The `D` parameter ensures that type recursion stops…

Of course, [the actual type](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/blob/main/packages/alfa-act/src/interview.ts#L28-L47) is much more crazy. It models an ""interview"" which is a sequence of questions (asked to an oracle), where each question expects a typed answer (`T` is a representation of this type (e.g. `""boolean""`, `""string[]""`), and `A` is the actual corresponding type (e.g. `boolean`, `Array<string>`); the `QUESTION` parameter is meta-data mapping the questions' URI to their type). An interview may contains several questions in a row (hence the recursion), and the depth is used to make sure the type works.

The type itself does build in TS 4.5.3, but then the way we use it (through yet some other layers of complication) breaks…
I've tried to adapt the code to get it working in 4.5.5. From first attempts, it seems that giving some hints about the actual value of `D` helps 🤔 It feels like TS is now too eager in setting `D=3` and thus struggles when nesting interviews…

I don't really consider this as a bug. Feels more like a very corner case… Plus haven't been able to get a MWNE to study… But I guess you might want to hear about it 😊 
(and my secret hope is that you'll have a ""aha!"" moment seing the description and knowing the content of this PR much better than me 😀 )"
So is it *wrong* to do it in `program.ts`? Do we need both? I'm mostly asking for my own understanding.
"> Which platforms support all of the options?

I don't think there's a single platform that supports everything.  (or maybe something like tvOSSimulator where you could probably choose to use the JIT, or mini or LLVM AOT, with or without interpreter as a fallback).

> Is this something we should expose directly as a non _prefixed property?

I don't think so.  1. The `MONO_AOT_MODE_*` constants in the runtime embedding API are a confusing mess. 2. The `--aot=[opts]` AOT compiler options don't map onto them exactly and give a different matrix of configurations - not all of which are sensible, and they don't really give you a good idea of what behavior you chose.

It would be better to have some frontend property that lets you pick the behavior you want and then errors out if you pick something unsupported: 
* Primary execution mode: AOT, JIT, interpreter
* Fallback execution mode: AOT, JIT, interpreter, none
* (optional) codegen backend: mini, LLVM, or bitcode 

Not every combination of primary/fallback is sensible; not every combination of primary/fallback is supported on every workload; not every codegen backend is supported on every platform - and for most workloads there's probably one reasonable default.
(And I probably missed some execution mode that doesn't fit this pattern).

But at least it expresses intent, rather than our odd choice of constants from some header file.


---

Mapping our existing execution mode schemes:

| Name | Primary EE | Fallback EE | codegen backend | Note |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| JIT    | JIT              | None            | mini   | |
| LLVM JIT | JIT      | None  | LLVM | |
| AOT  | AOT | JIT | - | ""regular"" AOT: minimal effort AOT, no generic sharing for valuetypes |
| ""hybrid"" AOT | AOT | JIT | - | like ""full"" below, but with a JIT fallback |
| ""full"" AOT | AOT | None | mini | |
| LLVM Only | AOT | None | LLVM | Use our fork of LLVM |
| bitcode | AOT | None | bitcode | Produce LLVM bitcode that upstream vanilla LLVM can use |
| Interp | AOT | Interp | mini | (I think this prefers AOT images if it finds them)
| LLVMOnlyInterp | AOT | interp | LLVM/bitcode(?) | (comment in jit.h is wrong, this doesn't set 'force_use_interpreter', so I think it will prefer to use AOT images)
| InterpLLVMOnly | Interp | None | LLVM / bitcode(?) | (comment in jit.h is wrong, this sets 'force_use_interpreter' so it will interpret methods, but I think it will take trampolines from AOT images)
| InterpOnly | Interp | None | -(?) | (I think this one tries to JIT trampolines on non-DISABLE_JIT platforms)

This isn't a perfect description because inside the runtime there's no single primary/fallback switch - it's more like a series of conditions ('force_use_interpreter', whether AOT images are found and contain the expected method, whether to use ""aot trampolines"", etc) and what gets compiled into the AOT images and which backend was used.

This means we get oddities like ""InterpOnly"" on Android (and Mac Catalyst, I think) will try to JIT trampolines."
"My last try (promised!) - This is a doc I wrote for my implementation (at least I would have tried everything I could to gain attention on this)...

## Json polymorphism support

One of the big issue to solve when de/serializing objects is to manage polymorphism: when an abstraction must be serialized, the type of the serialized object **must** also be written so that deserialization know what to instantiate.

### The classical approach
The classical approach here is to inject a `$type` (or `_$type$_` or any strange enough property that contains a string with the name of the type) into the object properties. 
Since in JSON, collections (arrays, lists, sets) are expressed with `[arrays]` (and this cannot hold any property), another syntactical
construct is required for collections, typically something like `{ ""$type"" : ""A(int)"", ""$values"" : [1,2,3] }`.

Note that, in this approach, serialized objects with or without a type are structurally identical (only the existence of the `$type` property makes the difference) whereas serialized collections ARE structurally different (they appear inside a ""wrapper"" object).

> When is a `$type` NOT required? When the object's type is *statically known*, when the de/serialized type is *unambiguous*. As soon as 
> an ambiguity exists, **polymorphism** is at stake.

The `object` type being the ""worst case of polymorphism"", but any interface or base class with specializations are *ambiguous*), the runtime type of the object MUST be serialized and MUST be used to deserialize the object.

We consider ""Structural Difference"" between unambiguous and polymorphic objects to be a good thing since this obliges the reader to take care of the *object's type* if there is one.
Without any difference in the shape of the data, a polymorphic object can be falsely read as an object of an *unambiguous* (wrong) type. 

### Structural Polymorphism

We are using a different approach that offers the following advantages:
- No ""magic name"" like `$type` or `$values`.
- Uniform type handling for objects and collections: there is always a ""Structural Difference"" between a *polymorphic* and an *unambiguous* shape.

Thanks to this, the code is simple and can be split in 3 layers:
- Nullable layer: the `null` occurrence is handled.
- Polymorphic layer: a 2-cells array is expected, the first cell containing the type name, the second one the unambiguous object's representation.
- Unambiguous layer (the exact type is known): the serialize/deserialize code handles purely the object's data.

Last (but not least) advantage of this approach: **when deserializing, the type is known BEFORE the object's data**. This enable deserializer to easily work in ""pure streaming"" (no lookup required, no intermediate instantiation): the Utf8Reader can be used directly.

Below is a simple example with:
```csharp
class Person
{
   public string Name { get; set; }
}

class Student : Person
{
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

class Teacher : Person
{
    public bool IsChief { get; set; }
}
```

The C# `Student[]` is an array of Student. There is no specialization, hence no ambiguity: `[{""Name"":""A"", ""Age"":12},{""Name"":""B"", ""Age"":13}]`.

The C# `Person[]` can contain 3 different types of objects. Each item needs to be ""typed"":
`[[""Student"",{""Name"":""A"", ""Age"":12}],[""Person"",{""Name"":""E""}],[""Teacher"",{""Name"":""T"",""IsChief:false}]]`.

When the same array of Persons is known only as an object[] (or any other non-unique ""base"" type like the non-generic `ICollection`), then the array itself requires its type:
`[""A(Person)"",[[""Student"",{""Name"":""A"", ""Age"":12}],[""Person"",{""Name"":""E""}],[""Teacher"",{""Name"":""T"",""IsChief:false}]]]`

This PR (which relies on the custom marshalers PR, #47640) introduces a new icall (```InvokeJSFunction```) that is used to invoke JS functions from C#. It takes a 'do it yourself' approach to things like error handling (in order to avoid JS roundtrips for try/catch blocks) and attempts to remove overhead in various other places so that scenarios not needing that overhead can be much faster. It's also designed to be (partially) AOT friendly by making the core icall not generic.

The icall enforces some rules to produce good performance:
* The name of the function being invoked must be interned. This allows the function itself to be cached using the address of the interned string as a key (interned strings are not relocatable), so the lookup is very fast.
* The function pointed to must not change at runtime (so it can be cached).
* The function being invoked must not return a value, if it does the icall will return an error code.
  * This is because marshaling a return value of unknown type means we have to box it - JS->C# invokes already pay this unavoidable tax and it sucks.
* The function being invoked must not throw an Error, if it does the icall will return an error code.
  * Marshaling exceptions universally is finicky and in some scenarios the caller wants to handle the error in their own way, i.e. set a flag or store info on the error somewhere instead of throwing a C# exception.
* The maximum number of arguments is 3.
* All arguments are passed as ```(RuntimeTypeHandle type, IntPtr arg)``` pairs, where (depending on type):
  * If ```type``` is a pointer, ```arg``` is the raw pointer value.
  * If ```type``` is a ValueType, ```arg``` is the address of the value.
  * Otherwise (if ```type``` is a reference type), ```arg``` is the address of the location of the object reference on the stack. This is so that if the GC relocates the object, the callee will see the new post-relocation address.

The new icall offers some new features as part of the deal:
* The function name can contain dots (i.e. ```Module._free```) and the icall will walk the scope chain to find the target function - we can afford to do this since we cache the result.
* If the function name starts with ```BINDING```, ```MONO``` or ```INTERNAL```, the icall will look the function up inside the appropriate runtime API object instead of in the global scope, so those function names will work even if we are running modularized and they are not exposed in the global scope.

For scenarios not covered by the new icall, the intended solution is to expose higher-level convenience wrappers that provide the bells and whistles people expect. This keeps the icall slim and fast so that in use cases where you want maximum performance, you can get it. At present the PR provides ```InvokeJSResult InvokeJSFunctionByName<T1, T2, T3> (string internedFunctionName, ref T1 arg1, ref T2 arg2, ref T3 arg3)``` as a convenience wrapper that automatically handles producing the type/address pairs for you.

As a proof of concept, the PR changes ```JSObject.Invoke```, ```JSObject.SetProperty``` and ```JSObject.GetProperty``` to go through the new icall. I have a feeling we don't actually want to do this, but it serves as a good example of how to use the icall and was also useful for flushing out bugs and getting a sense of its performance.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/67313

While performing string `StartsWith` or `EndsWith` operations we try to optimize when having ASCII characters. We apply the optimization only if we don't have characters outside ASCII range nor we don't have characters need special handling (like `\0` which treated as ignored character). We detect the special character by using internal the internal table `HighCharTable`.  In some cases, we can have the source string be shorter than string we check (e.g. doing something like `""A"".StartsWith(""A\0"")` , we check the remaining character `\0` if it is ASCII but we don't check if it is special character using `HighCharTable`. This cause StartsWith/EndsWith return the wrong result. 
The fix is simply adding the check using `HighCharTable` to ensure the correct result.

Let's test combinations of single- and multi- declarations in the same method.

Also, something feels wrong about the structure of this method:
- In the case for single-declaration, we don't pass the declaration that we found into `LowerBoundLocalDeclarationUsingVar`. But in the multi-declaration case we do.

"> This PR adds the same getCanonicalUri method from resolvers to file system providers.

Needing to duplicate an API in two places tells me that both places are wrong. Why isn’t there one central place where extensions can register such canonical uri logic? 

Assuming, there is `FileSystemProvider#getCanonicalUri` would you suggest that VS Code calls this all the time for things like knowing what the true casing of a path is? Today, we assume that all paths that are returned from a FSP are canonical and that they don't go through further massage. 

I believe that you don't want to get in the business of canonical uris because it will quickly turn into a bottom-less hole.

"I have some more clues now. It indeed seems like the current ”solution” in this PR only really patches the symptom of something else going wrong. 

Here's is the code where this PR

```typescript
	public lookupPrimaryKeybinding(commandId: string, context?: IContextKeyService): ResolvedKeybindingItem | null {
		let items = this._lookupMap.get(commandId);
		if (typeof items === 'undefined' || items.length === 0) {
			return null;
		}

		const itemMatchingContext = context &&
			Array.from(items).reverse().find(item => context.contextMatchesRules(item.when));
		return itemMatchingContext ?? items[items.length - 1];
	}
```

When the bug happens `context.contextMatchesRules()` fails to match any of te bindings that are returned from `this._lookupMap.get()`. Which leads to a ”best guess” fallback, which does not have enough information for making an informed guess. I saw somewhere that it should go in specificity order. And when both alternatives available for the fallback are equally specific, or bets are off.

Here are the two bindings defined for the case mentioned in #126306:

```json
            {
                ""command"": ""paredit.forwardSexp"",
                ""mac"": ""alt+right"",
                ""win"": ""ctrl+right"",
                ""linux"": ""ctrl+right"",
                ""when"": ""calva:keybindingsEnabled && editorLangId == clojure && editorTextFocus && paredit:keyMap =~ /original|strict/ && config.calva.paredit.hijackVSCodeDefaults && !calva:cursorInComment || calva:cursorAfterComment""
            },
            {
                ""command"": ""paredit.forwardSexp"",
                ""mac"": ""ctrl+right"",
                ""win"": ""alt+right"",
                ""linux"": ""alt+right"",
                ""when"": ""calva:keybindingsEnabled && editorLangId == clojure && editorTextFocus && paredit:keyMap =~ /original|strict/ && !config.calva.paredit.hijackVSCodeDefaults && !calva:cursorInComment || calva:cursorAfterComment""
            },
```

They are equally specific, only differing in wether `config.calva.paredit.hijackVSCodeDefaults` should be true or false, giving the command palette and other call sites an arbitrary binding alternative.

However, whatever is translating the actual keyboard events successfully interprets the context and the `when` clauses of the alternatives. So we shouldn't have to be guessing at all here."

You're not crazy. 

@github and @github - I'm leaning very heavily in the direction of going back to `Content.ToString()` for this and simply logging a warning for the unsupported platforms. It's more consistent, easier to implement, and easier to maintain. I know we have visibility issues with those warnings, but I think that's a separate issue.

"`parameter.ExplicitDefaultConstantValue` doesn't return a bad constant value in this scenario, because it doesn't really know that something is wrong yet. Using the `void F(object param = F()) { }` case as an example:
1. We compute the default value for `param`. The first thing we do is bind the default syntax value.
2. We bind the call to `F()`, including its default arguments.
3. We compute the default value for `param`. (This is reentrant.)
    - Since the completion part `StartDefaultSyntaxValue` has been set, we just return `ConstantValue.Unset`, and enter this code path that this comment thread is attached to.
4. After that we pass the bound default value (the call `F()`) to `ParameterHelpers.ReportDefaultParameterErrors`.
    - This reports `ERR_DefaultValueMustBeConstant` and returns `true`
5. Since `ReportDefaultParameterErrors` returned `true` we return `ConstantValue.Bad` as the ""final"" default value for the parameter.

I'll add a test that will hopefully illustrate this better, at least the last part, since I can't seem to find such a test added in this PR already.

Note that the behavior of returning `ConstantValue.Unset` occurs both for reentrant scenarios as well as for multithreaded scenarios. It's possible that we want to do something like have a reentrant usage return `ConstantValue.Bad`, while a multithreaded scenario will spin wait until the constant value is available. I am actually not sure how to accomplish that in `SourceComplexParameterSymbol.DefaultSyntaxValue`. Perhaps the binder should instead avoid accessing the default value on a parameter if `BinderFlags.ParameterDefaultValue` is set and just use `ConstantValue.Bad` as a placeholder.

Also, I had hoped to pass `hasErrors: true` here so that we will always fail in emit if no other (better) diagnostic is given, but it ended causing some diagnostic reporting in `ParameterHelpers.ReportDefaultParameterErrors` to be skipped, and I wasn't sure how to square it all without causing a lot of test churn. #Closed"
"Uh, er, is this really something we want to do?  Depend upon an *internal* target?

This feels wrong and brittle."
I re-read my comment and I think I sent the wrong message. It looks to be working properly. Good stuff!
"> For what it's worth, I think that handling this in emit is actually quite a bit more complicated, and potentially error prone, then having this handled in binding and letting it flow through ""naturally"".

The nature of the changes that were made in binding resulted in observable changes in behavior of APIs that compiler implements and likely resulted in unintended binding behavior changes. Though it might feel simpler to adjust binding behavior in this way in order to achieve desired IL gen outcome, that would cause compiler to behave not according to the language specification in an observable way. This would be the wrong thing to do.

this is intentional, yea. In general, I thought that the Remoting lib could exist regardless of the fact that it's exclusively being used for the Terminal. Not having a dependency on the settings model makes the build for that project a lot simpler too. Though, this is something I'm hitting with tear-out now too - it absolutely would be easier just to pass the `ActionAndArgs[]` up to the monarch to have them dispatch it, but I'd really rather avoid it. So I think it'll have to be the serialization of the args.

Oh yikes. I hadn't thought about that either. I wonder what something like Sublime Text does. I know ST will restore window layouts on launch, and can also be invoked on a directory directly. At least for Sublime, it'll restore all the previously closed windows, then _also_ open the newly requested one.

3. Projects where the developer will appreciate using a monitoring solution (AppInsights, OpenTelemetry, etc) or ad-hoc tools (dotnet-counters) to make the stats available for them in the future: 10-20% apps
4. Projects where neither the stats nor the perf matters: 50+% of apps

I'm worried about the experience of people in group (3). I want them to be able to turn on telemetry very easily when they want it. Anything where they have to follow extra instructions or change more lines of code creates friction in that process. If that means a tiny set of projects in group (1) have to have some friction to disable stats they don't care about I think it is the right tradeoff given my guess at the relative sizes of those groups.

"> Yeah, but we are not just shuffling bytes here. The callback is responsible for a bunch of stuff other than just pushing bytes to the connection -- e.g. assigning stream ID. framing, etc.

In the end its all bytes, you'd just shift from doing it earlier to doing it later. You enqueue the write and then later frame the buffers on the way out. This has the added benefit of potentially batching bigger writes together framed a single HTTP/2 data frame on the wire.

For reference, here's Kestrel's implementation:

This is where the loop is kicked off:

https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/a861d18d244a632281ef4a1402f29ad1051e5bf9/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http2/Http2OutputProducer.cs#L77

Http2FrameWriter is the component that does the flow control and adds http framing to the bytes:

cc @github to clarify if I got anything wrong"
My test was wrong and I have fixed it
"The particular value of the runtime base check isn't to validate them in cases where there is a cross-module boundary. Its to validate the data that *would be* used in a cross module boundary to ensure that the general type layout processing is correct. It turns out that while not exactly matching up to a useful value, it has been quite valuable at finding all kinds of edge cases that do affect the within version bubble cases. In particular, it is good at finding cases where the alignment calculations were subtly wrong in a way that didn't cause a field offset to be wrong in that particular test case, but could have caused a problem for other fields on the type.

Now, if it turns out the only incorrectness is caused by this incorrect conflation of cross boundary and non-deriving, we could use a different sentinel value like 0xFFFFFFFF or something or simply not allow a sentinel value for types that derive directly from object. @github I assume that you have an arm32 test environment where you can test this locally? Relying on the CI for this sort of testing is a giant time waster.

Also, what I've found in the past is that when a layout issue is particularly nasty is that I need to build a standalone repro of the bug, and debug in parallel through the native CLR type layout logic and the managed type layout logic and find where they differ. I worry that when you consolidated the 3 different ways in which we calculated base offset that you actually removed a way in which they are required to be very subtly different."

<hr />

This fixes an issue in Server GC where an item in the finalizer queue became stale due to not being relocated.

The problem was that a finalizable object was allocated on one heap, but registered in the finalizer queue of another heap (this is possible due to heap balancing). In CFinalize::UpdatePromotedGenerations, we ask for the generation of an object, and move the object to the correct section of the finalizer queue. In the error case, we obtained the wrong result for the generation of the object because it lived on another heap, and that heap hadn't set the final generation for the region containing the object yet. So we ended up moving the finalizer entry to the section corresponding to gen 2, and missed a relocation of the object occurring in a gen 1 collection afterwards.

Fix: It seems best to make sure an object is always registered for finalization on the heap it's allocated from, so the fix simply fetches the heap from the alloc context after the allocation in the case of SOH, or determines it by calling gc_heap::heap_of in the case of LOH and POH. In the case of SOH, I added an assert to ensure that the heap obtained agrees with the result of calling gc_heap::heap_of.

I also added some dprintf calls to the finalizer logic to aid in future investigations.

"> There's 0% benefit on any Windows system with any file system?

According to https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120120-00/?p=8493 (which might be outdated as it was referring to Windows 7):

> If you issue around six reads in a row, each of which begins where the previous one left off, then the cache manager switches to FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN behavior for your file

But here for 99.99% of the cases we perform a single read (the size of the buffer passed to the OS is equal to the file size). I would expect it to be smart enough to recognize the pattern.

> Should we simply change the implementation to only specify this on Windows, since there it's (I believe, please correct me if I'm wrong) free 

From the benchmarks that I've run (Win 11 + SSD + NTFS + BitLocker) I see no perf gains. I can add it for Windows if you think it's worth it just in case it's beneficial for some other configs (older Windows? FAT32?). "

"> If the application completed, it's done writing too, right? Can we just fully close the stream?

The HTTP/3 spec says a server should abort reading if the server has completed processing.

> Or does this happen only when the body PipeReader was completed? If that's the case, maybe the message should say ""The application stopped reading the request body."" or something.

I have reused the logging message that the HTTP layer reports when a request is completed without reading the request body.

This code only executes once the request delegate is complete. If some code is still trying to read from the request body then they are doing something wrong. I think this error accurately describes why reading from the body."

"> Because it's not too challenging to get right at this scale. 

That's not an acceptable reason.  Complexity has to justify itself over non complex solutions.  ""because we can"" isn't a reason.   We have countless examples of unnecessary complexity being something that has significantly impacted us in extremely poor ways over Roslyn's lifetime.  There are times when it is appropriate, and data shows the value we get out of that.  But in the absense of that, we should be going for the simplest, correct, solution we can provide.

In this case, it seems like a simple lock, with a couple of data fields (or one, if you want to just merge the boolean + the count into one field), would be sufficient.  It would then be far more trivial to review, comprehend, and maintain.  

There's nothing wrong with using a lock.  It's what we do almost entirely in the IDE code (that, or just using tasks ordering), and it works very well and is consistent with the rest of the code.  Since we don't use these lock-free/wait-free forms, this means this code is automatically much harder to reason about since it's different from our standard patterns and practices, and practically no one on the IDE routinely codes this way.

Please follow the patterns of the rest of the IDE unless we have data that indicates substantive problems with those approaches that warrant these types of solutions."
"@github, I think those test failures are an issue caused by running on the wrong runtime.

I can see in AzDo, that the failing test ran as part of workitem `{ ""HelixJobId"": ""91361424-0db7-42aa-ba2d-5656f83b8c40"", ""HelixWorkItemName"": ""Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Embedded.Tests--net461"" }` and the successful one ran as part of `{ ""HelixJobId"": ""91361424-0db7-42aa-ba2d-5656f83b8c40"", ""HelixWorkItemName"": ""Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Embedded.Tests--net6.0"" }`

Looking at those names, I'm suspicious. Does that imply that the failing test actually tried to run the binary on the .NET 4.6.1 runtime, and the succeeding test ran on the .NET 6 runtime. If so, that is an indication that the test passed just fine as we don't expect these images to actually work on .NET 4.6.1 after running crossgen.

"Yes! It works when I manually check it, but I'm not completely sure on how to check with all the unit tests. Is there any documentation on how to run all your tests correctly? I ran from the command line before I ever made any changes, but there were still a couple API checks which did not pass even then, which tells me I'm doing something wrong.

My process is now:
1. Clean CascadiaPackage
2. Rebuild CascadiaPackage
3. Deploy CascadiaPackage
4. Test > Run all tests

Is there another way I'm supposed to do this? What output should be expected and is okay to push with? Will this way run all of `runut.cmd`, `runft.cmd`, `runuia.cmd`, and `runformat` mentioned in ""How to build OpenConsole""?

Sorry if this is a little bit a lot. I haven't contributed to open source before, and so I'm trying to get the hang of it all (as well as Visual Studio).

Thank you for all your help!"
Wrong indentation.
"I know, I did it on purpose :)

If someone just changes the top #if, I want them to be sure that they update the check. To avoid something to be landed that is wrong."
I think this is because the wrong configuration of System.Private.DataContractSerialization is getting picked. One more reason why not to go with this approach I guess.
"What I have here is actually wrong, we should check the `_connection` inside the lock. We handle all the changes to it inside a lock. So I have a potential race here. I need to fix this.
Thanks for pointing at this code and the locking!"
"Overall, I'm not saying that doing a binding check is wrong. I'm saying it's not necessary or even recommended per the guidelines we'd settled on. I'm okay with a binding check, although I agree with Rikki that it's not typical.

> I wrote that rule :) A diagnostic means that the tree is not valid in some fashion.

Neal was the compiler advocate for improving re-usability of nodes in incremental parsing and many features were added with parser-level language check under his watch after he'd created this document. The point of the rule is that we parse the best we can and get the same tree shape regardless of langver.
You're correct that we made an explicit exception for record-parsing (langver affects the shape of the tree in that case, ie. goes beyond diagnostics).

> this makes parsing not context free.

No. Incremental parsing is not impeded by having a language version diagnostic on new language syntax. In practice, what context-free means is that we prefer to avoid is passing flags into nested parsing methods. It doesn't mean we shouldn't produce langver diagnostics (as the many features added since discussion demonstrate).

I don't think that's a scenario ;-)"

> I would sync with @github and @github on this. When designing the `TargetFramework` changes, we had said that we would recommend being explicit about the platform versions for iOS and Android.

Yes, I totally agree that the message to app developers should be that they should be explicit about the platform version (and that should be reflected in our samples and templates).

However, in this particular case, it's for our own (the Xamarin.iOS' team) tests, and things get a bit less clear.

> For a given version of .NET, we should not change the default target platform version out from under you (once we've shipped an RTM of the tools supporting that version). So if `net6.0-ios` means version 13.6 of iOS, we can't change the SDK later on so that it means 13.7 or 14.0. Once we add support for `net7.0-ios`, we could choose a different default platform version in that case.

I think one thing that should be clarified is who exactly defines the default target platform version (who is ""we"" in the sentence above?)

I was under the impression that it would be the SDK teams (the Xamarin.iOS team for iOS), which means it would be the Xamarin.iOS team who would be responsible for updating the default target platform version whenever that can/should be done.

And in that case, as it stands with this PR, all our tests would start using the new default once we (the Xamarin.iOS team) change it (and that seemed like the behavior I'd expect when we change the default).

> So I don't know if leaving the platform version out of the `TargetFramework` would avoid needing to update the number anyway.

This is not something we ship, so we can always change our decision later if we find out that I was wrong."
Hmm - nothing immediately obvious stands out to me as being wrong.  Potentially the test workspace doesn't have the right reference for `System.Runtime.InteropServices`?  Not sure that is the case though.  I can check out this branch tomorrow (its the end of my work day now) and see if I can help debug where its going wrong and report back.
"Correct. The previous behavior was that this would *not* write out the file if it contained compile errors, but it's hard to diagnose why the file isn't compiling if you can't see it. So this now means ""generate to disk"" instead of ""generate in memory"" and throws the exception after writing out the file so that you can actually see it to figure out what's wrong"
"I did not get the part about `GetOptionalParametersCnt`. Are you suggesting to make a method:

The current error message gave me no pointers on what was/went wrong when I had an extra parameter to `ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<SomeClass>(provider, usedParameter, unusedParameter)`. I experimentally found out that this causes issues. 

Adding to the error message that all parameters have to be consumed would have saved me some time, and I hope that this change will save some time for a future developer.

Example that gave me unclear instructions:
```cs
        private interface IService
        {
            string Name { get; }
        }

        private class Service : IService
        {
            public string Name { get; set; }
        }

        private class MyClass
        {
            private readonly IService serviceA;
            private readonly IService serviceB;

            public MyClass(IService serviceA, IService serviceB)
            {
                this.serviceA = serviceA;
                this.serviceB = serviceB;
            }

            public void Print()
            {
                Console.WriteLine(serviceA.Name);
                Console.WriteLine(serviceB.Name);
            }
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var services = new ServiceCollection();
            services.AddSingleton<IService>(p => new Service { Name = ""Injected"" });

            var provider = services.BuildServiceProvider();

            var special = new Service { Name = ""Special"" };

            // The extra ""Unused"" string is not consumed by MyClass
            ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<MyClass>(provider, special, ""Unused"");

            // Throws: System.InvalidOperationException: 'A suitable constructor for type 'TestProject.Program+MyClass' could not be located. Ensure the type is concrete and services are registered for all parameters of a public constructor.'

Currently we are making a call to Interop.AppleCrypto.X509GetSubjectSummary on each call to EnsureCertData. 
However, this is needed only when something goes wrong, for a better error message. Thus, moving the call into the catch block.

"> I mean, that's an interesting feature creep that requires a lot of human labor. An alternative here would be to simply run the SendToHelix task in an msbuild environment where warnings are not set as errors, which is why this warning was promoted to being an error. We've already tried just logging a message that used logging commands to be a warning in the build, this was ignored.

But this doesn't solve the problem that we start showing EOL to clients with no alternative to migrate to. I don't think that's a good experience for the client teams? It's not a lot of work too - we are already doing extra work when EOL warning starts for a queue, I think adding one more record to the YAML is not too crazy a requirement?
"
Wrong comment?
@github I would expect in the future that this experience is more integrated. I imagine support for this within razor itself (when it detects a component inside a view it knows what to do and offers appropriate intellisense) is that crazy?
Just to be pedantic since this change is taking longer than it needs to. What's wrong with `=`?
"Hi Ryan,
glad we are on the same page on the possible use cases for this.
I guess adding all those scenarios in the example will help to not get this comment lost. let me know if I can help.


------
David - you are on point mentioning logs, as it is relevant for all the scenarios, not only for tracing. As I started to replace the current logic on applications with this package (as I published a backport package to 2.1-2.2), it has been the main pain point (on top of the clumsy setup which now Ryan got much better :) ).

I was originally tempted to include the ability to also add the header to the logging scope, but it seemed out of scope. However right now to add a value to the logging scope you either have to capture it from the `HttpContext` again on a separate middleware or, expecially when you rely on the factory, you have to access the `HeaderPropagationValues` (which hold these values) from a separate middleware to add those values to the logging scope, which feels wrong (I guess ideally it should be internal but then you will close this door).

Sorry for going off topic, but It would be really nice to have your opinion on this. Thank you.

"
"nah. You and @github are right but for the wrong reason. "
Doesn't this allocate a crazy number of arrays?
I think I answered my own question [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23703/files#r450629775). You can correct me if I'm wrong.
"I would not do this - `RelatedAssemblyAttribute` is from Mvc.Core which is part of the framework, so pretty much always loaded into the default ALC. So this is the same as doing `AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath`.
If in the future something loads the ""main"" assembly (the one with the related assemblies on it) into a secondary ALC this will likely be wrong and things might break. I think it should be `AssemblyLoadContext.GetLoadContext(assembly).LoadFromAssemblyPath` - where `assembly` is the ""main"" assembly."
"You shouldn't need this check or the ""above 0x10FFFF?"" check below. If you change line 540 below to call `Rune.TryCreate` instead of `new Rune(...)`, that will detect UTF-16 surrogate or above-0x10FFFF inputs and return _false_. So you'd end up with:

```cs
if (!Rune.TryCreate(currentDecodeBits, out Rune rune) || !rune.TryEncodeToUtf16(/* ... */))
{
    return false; // something went wrong
}
```"
"Returning `Name` for the `RelativePath` will also be wrong. The test will fail no matter what. So, it is better to set the correct value or not set it at all"
"Yes, the comment is wrong."
"> With that, both formatters will do the serialization and check if the `model is null` and report back the `NoValue` state, that is where I feel we can do better, something like
> 
> ```cs
> if (model == null && !context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue)

>     return InputFormatterResult.NoValue();
> }
> ```

I'm not sure we want to report failure at such a low layer. After all, `null` is one of the ""nonempty inputs might deserialize as null"" that the `BodyModelBinder` needs to know about. I don't think that either `!context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue` nor `EmptyBodyBehavior.Disallow` implies that a `null` literal should be rejected outright. It should be if the parameter is non-nullable, but we don't know that at the `InputFormatter` layer do we?

We probably should be changing this to return `InputFormatterResult.Success(null);` for `null` literals instead of `InputFormatterResult.NoValue();` regardless of `TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue` because it's not truly empty.

It's a literal default value, and the whole problem here seems to be that both empty input and null literals are being collapsed into a single `NoValue()` when `TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue` is `false`. It's fine for these values to be collapsed when `TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue` is `true`, because that's what you asked for, but not the other way around.

I don't think it's necessary to check if there was an empty request body or `null` because the method you're modifying, ` ReadRequestBodyAsync`, is only called when the body is non-empty (or at least we think it will be) that what the `canHaveBody` logic I linked to earlier was doing. It was deciding whether to call `ReadRequestBodyAsync` or return `NoValue()` immediately:

https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/39219394f66854db5d556ad78f9bb065ee48b585/src/Mvc/Mvc.Core/src/Formatters/InputFormatter.cs#L102-L116

And if the `canHaveBody` logic was wrong, and we thought there was going to be a body but it turned out to be empty, `JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync()` in  `SystemTextJsonInputFormatter` will throw a `JsonException` which will always be turned into a `Failure()`.

Unfortunately, Json.NET turns an empty body into `null` when you try to deserialize. Again the `canHaveBody` checks should prevent this from happening for most empty bodies but not all. I assume we copied the `if (model == null && !context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue)` logic from the `NewtonsoftJsonInputFormatter` to the `SystemTextJsonInputFormatter` because it makes very little sense in the latter case where it will only return `null` for a null literal and nothing else.

@github Is there anything wrong with just removing the `if (model == null && !context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue)` branch entirely `SystemTextJsonInputFormatter` and always `return InputFormatterResult.Success(model);` when `JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync()` doesn't throw?

I imagine we'll have to be more careful with the Json.NET input formatter for back compat. It's always reliably treated `null` and empty bodies as exactly the same because they were indistinguishable from just the call to `Deserialize`. We could in theory try to test if any bytes were actually read from the body stream after the fact to determine the difference, but that would be a breaking change."
"> not sure why you want that in the comment in the code

Because that's what people will be reading in the future... Please put yourself in my shoes for a moment.  Say i need to debug through this code 6-12 months from now.  Something has gone wrong and i step in here and i see this comment and this check.  Now i'm scratching my head tring to figure out what's going on and if this might be hte source of the problem i'm looking at.

Now, i have a few things that could help.  The most ideal would be clear explanations in the code of what's going on.  That allows me to understand while keeping me in context.

in the absence of that i must now do an external investigation of this code to try to figure out what's going on.  For example, i may have to now track this code back in git to figure out hte inception point, which can be brutally difficult at times, especially when code is moved *across* files.  This may or may not lead to me useful information.

As such, i far prefer when we try to make the code *itself* as clear as possible to help future maintainers.  Note that this is not a speculative concern.  As someone who had to try to track down many issues in formatting over hte years, this sort of approach to the code would have been *majorly* appreciated.

I do not feel like it is unwarranted or excessive to ask people making changes to complex and subtle parts of the system to then put in a little extra effort toward making the changes clearer.  it really goes a long way and is very appreciated.  Thanks much!"
this surprises me.  what was wrong with the prevoius color?
"In any case: if you don't investigate that prior to merge, I'd say you should instead disable the test (rather than update to an incorrect baseline) and file a tracking bug. The IDE generally does _not_ do the ""assert the wrong thing for now"" pattern."
"Unfortunately 'containsdiagnostic' is often wrong.  For example, syntactic *warnings* will trigger it.  

We should just get the SyntaxReferences for the NamedTypeSymbol though and check those directly (i.e. checking for the right severity).  

so this should be more like:

```c#
foreach (var syntaxRef in namedTypeSymbol.DeclaringSyntaxReferences) 
     if (syntaxRef.GetSyntax(cancellationToken).GetDiagnostics(...))`"
"> the language version check seems wrong 

I think the intent was to replace it with corresponding nullable warning and have it be enabled/disabled as all other nullable warnings.

"""Mirror"" represents LiveShare spinning up a proxy for the server IIRC. So when you have ""RunOnHost"" it means there's a LiveShare server on the guest that gest spun up to proxy calls to your server running on the host. For instance, LiveShare's proxy client's have ""RunOnGuest"" and they're the only ones that have that. I could be wrong here but there were a lot of discussions about how this should function and ultimately language servers shouldn't have to apply the ""RunOnX"" attribute."
"> I just realized, why are you doing this? There is a better mechanism in .NET Core to do this and what is worse this is wrong for BCL assemblies and will issues warnings for customers.

We are trying to make the illink work with XA, so we want to get to a state where the linked apps run fine. The preserve lists are the ones we are using with the original linker. I am going to review these and update some of them in the following PR.

So far I see this warning:
```
17:39:13.625   1:8>ILLink : warning IL2001: System.AppDomainSetup: Type System.AppDomainSetup has no fields to preserve [C:\Users\rodo\git\xa-master\bin\TestDebug\temp\DotNetBuildRodoTrue\UnnamedProject.csproj]
```

What is this better mechanism you mention? I might try to use it when I am looking at it next week."
">Also, I suspect there are other codepaths in binding we don't report all binding errors if the expression contains syntax errors. 

Not for subpatterns apparently - probably because we only had an identifier before and it couldn't go wrong. I did a little experiment to see how it looks like (with all green pattern tests; semantic and syntax): https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/d3f1e7f1bd1c14c2ca3a398eae71a9c18b912a1f?w=1
We already use `preview` version so there wasn't a need to adjust the baseline.

Anywho, if you feel that's gonna be an issue I'll be fine to keep it in the binding."

"So, I've got some feelings about this new Color Schemes page. I think we might have gone ""too hard"" on Expanders, to the point where the page has lost coherence. It's a page for editing color schemes, it should not take so many clicks to _edit a color scheme_, you know? Hiding the various types of color, which are all kinda the same setting at the end of the day, in different groups... it rubs me the wrong way.

In addition to that, Add New and Rename getting their own areas, separate from the scheme, feels like they were just bolted on as an afterthought.

I want us to stop and reconsider this page, and how it flows. The preview on top, the scheme selector (which is a _single setting_ that controls the _contents of the page_), and then the colors might be the wrong order in which to tackle it.

If we had a ground-up redo, what would our color scheme editor look like? How would we want the user to flow through it?"
"`count - offset` looks wrong here, `offset` can easily be bigger than `count`, in which case you'd end up trying to create an array of a negative size.

Shouldn't it be just `count` instead?

```csharp
var srcManagedBuffer = new byte [count];
var dstManagedBuffer = new byte [count];
```"
"More I'm just not sure what advantage `Unbox` gives here. Typically I think of `Unbox` as useful when I want a `ref T` for the unbox. Essentially the ability to mutate the object. Here we immediately return the result by value hence I'm just not clear what `Unsafe.Unbox` is giving us here. 

Not saying it's wrong, just saying I'm missing the win it's providing over casting. "
"That would require quite a lot of changes over the JIT code base as all code addresses in JIT are read-execute and the RW are used only at places where it is needed. So everywhere that dst is used now, it would become dstRE. That seemed like a noise change to me that would obscure the real changes.

> what would happen if a jit developer uses a wrong address for a write (dstRW instead of dstRE, or dstRE instead of dstRW)

If you attempt to write using dstRE address when jitting, the JIT would crash as it would not be able to write there. If you use the dstRW address instead of dstRE, it would be fine unless you use it for code relative address computation.
I've tried to use the dstRW only locally so that it would be hard to make such a mistake. The only exception is the NOP generating code that calls itself recursively and it would have to update the RE pointers to match the RW all the time.
In fact, I'd rather remove the dstRW usage at other places and change it to (dst + writeableOffset).

> will we see the issue on the platforms without W^X protection?

There will be no such platforms (except of crossgen usage of the JIT)

> Can we catch them at compilation time?

We would have to change all the `BYTE* dst` to `const BYTE* dst`, but it would still require the JIT developer to be disciplined enough to not to cast away the constness anywhere.

Frankly, my view on further updates to JIT were that everything would be done as before with the only exception being places where writes to the executable memory are added. At those places, the writeableOffset would need to be applied. But a bug in such a place would be easy and quick to discover - the JIT would just crash with access violation.

"For a method I think you're right, and actually I was mistaken and my comment is wrong, so we could allow it for methods.

> If you change it on a type we don't recompile all of the type's async methods

It's worse actually, for types we would need to recompile any async method that returns that type (though that isn't a C# 10 change)"
`NSObject` are wrong since it should be identical to the generic used on the type itself
"I was wrong, the check is not purely syntactic. We need to consider whether the accessor is abstract/extern or declared in an interface, etc. There is a ```SourcePropertyAccessorSymbol._isAutoPropertyAccessor``` field. It looks like it should be sufficient to check its value here. "
"I think this is better, that way we won't swallow errors, but let the app developer handle them even if we're not told what's going wrong:

```"
"You pasted the documentation, as per the docs: ""or 0.0 if the goal is **not in the behavior**."" so it will always return a NSNumber and if the behaviour is not there, it will be 0.0. So, the indexer seems to be wrong:

1. The binding says we get a nullable, the docs say otherwise, we should add a test for that.
2. If we return a 0.0 in an indexer is wrong. Indexers should throw an exception if the GKBejaviour is not present.

We should get the value, check the result and decide if we have a null or not and throw and except and remove the ! which is wrong and makes no sense. The binding is wrong and therefore the nullability."
"@github I'm not following here. Since the first accessor is using `field`, the backing field was marked as non-null calculated value. So we get a symbol back when speculating with `field`. Anything wrong with the current behavior?"
"If `embeddedStatement` is null, doesn't that mean there is something wrong?

Either the analyzer is reporting on a wrong (unexpected) node, or there is a missing handling of a syntax node in:

"In general, we want to support all Typescript types in JSDoc. The ideal is for eager Typescript users to be able to put Typescript types into jsdoc if they are stuck with vanilla javascript for some reason.

However, I think there is a conflict between the ?-suffix of jsdoc and the ? of the conditional. For example, `S extends JSDocType? ? never : any` has both, but the parser will be unable to tell whether the first ? is a suffix  or part of the conditional syntax.

I could be wrong, though! It’s really difficult to guess how the parser will behave without testing it."

No. The JIT compilation keep the whole thing alive."

"We have added this message in the past to catch iadvertant use of export/import in the top level of a script file. ppl used to do this by mistak, and spend hours to understand what is wrong with thier program.

  nope: string;

"> This never existed on 2.2 and 2.1 that’s a different issue.

@github I created [this demonstration](https://github.com/ldwedari/DotNetCore2_1DataRaceDemonstrator) based on the code that you posted in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/14975.
In 2.1.19 (master branch) there is a data race. But in 3.1.5 (TestWithNetCore3_1 branch) I cannot see it happening.

"I'm not sure it needs to be a diagnostic, there's no way the compiler can produce the scenario, so we don't have to worry about it in normal operation. But I think I'm with Jared on throwing an exception here: we would never expect a valid emit options to contain both encodings, thus trying to set both is wrong. The only way you could do that is if you're creating them yourself via the API and so an exception seems appropriate. We should try and make our APIs stop people creating things the compiler would never do.

"I find it somewhat ""disturbing""/""odd""/""unfortunate"" that this would be adding a *different* `GetBaseDefinition()` method in the context of the linker, with a *different* algorithm for comparing method return types (or lack thereof!) and parameter types!  See also:

The method here looks very similar to the one in Java.Interop -- which I now see is *incomplete*, because it doesn't check `MethodDefinition.HasOverrides`.

Which leads one to ask, *how many **different** (and potentially incomplete/wrong) implementations do we have to find the ""base"" method of an override?!*

"Okay actually spoke with @github offline - he's OOF today, but he mentioned that this probably needs a fallback for Windows 7, since the DirectX renderer is also used by the WpfControl, which works back to win 7.

"So close! I just have _ONE_ failing test: `DeserializationTests::TestRebindNestedCommand`.

### Summary

#### Test
1. ✅ bind nested commands to ""parent""
2. ❌ rebind ""parent"" to a plain ""newTab"" command

#### Discussion

This _should_ work. `ActionMap` is doing the following:
1. bind nested commands to ""parent""
	1. deserialize the command
	1. it's a nested command!
	1. add it to the action map
		1. check if it's a nested command (it is!)
		1. add it to `_NestedCommands`
	1. when name map is requested...
		1. go through non-nested commands (none)
		1. go through nested commands...	
			1. ""parent"" --> <nested commands> is added
2. rebind ""parent"" to a plain ""newTab"" command
	1. deserialize the command
	1. it's a ""newTab"" command!
	1. add it to the action map
		1. check if it's a nested command (it isn't!)
		2. add it to the `_ActionMap`
	1. when name map is requested...
		1. go through non-nested commands (none)
		2. go through parents (**I SEE THAT THIS IS THE PROBLEM NOW**)
		3. add nested commands

Ok, I see what the problem is now. Just had to think out loud for a bit. Looks like the order is wrong in `_PopulateNameMap`. I'll marinate on a fix and submit that tomorrow morning. But other than that (and a code format), we're good to go!"

"@github is that API used in your sample ?

It's nice to hide (or provide better API) than exposing `Selector` and `NSObject` in signatures - but without tests it's also easy too easy to get it wrong.

Since it's not a very common API (or framework) on macOS (only) I think it's fine to file an enhancement on it (would be a nice and not _too_ hard contribution from anyone consuming the API).

"This is wrong: when building for both armv7k and arm64_32 this if condition will be true when building for either architecture, not only arm64_32.

"Surprisely enough, if you open a PowerShell tab and run `wsl.exe`, the path `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\path` sent by WSL can also be used by PowerShell. It will correctly enter the WSL working directory. I remember seeing this on some article about WSL and Windows filesystem interoperablity. I just didn't not except that it works so seamlessly.

And I think this only works on Windows 2004 and WSL 2. Correct me if I'm wrong."
"Well, the test is just wrong. It turns out it doesn't pass when run without crossgen2, with exactly the same fault, but by putting the disable logic as IL in the test, we actually get testing that the behavior of the x86 type loader at runtime matches up with the behavior at crossgen2 time due to the presence of the --verify-type-and-field-layout switch that we use when compiling crossgen2 tests.

I agree though, I was quite disappointed to find that I needed to change the test.

As far as how much was passing, as I mentioned to you a couple days ago, I was looking for something different than endless infrastructure stuff, so I took a look at this, and its come pretty clean. At this point I believe our type layout is very nearly correct, as is our argument layout handling, which leaves whatever interesting details are special about x86 in the jit interface. I have some suspicions that then handling of single element struct normalization isn't quite right, but its not all that far off from right."
"These entries will need to be `x64`. `DotNet_x64Test` should build `x64` when possible.

Unfortunately, you will also need to add a project ordering dependency from PublicTerminalCore or WPFControl to your new shim project. Otherwise, the build will proceed in the wrong order."
"yes, this is dumb. no, this is not a drill"
"I personally believe `assert` should be preferred over `FAIL_FAST_IF` for ""soft-assertions"".
What I mean is basically assertions, that if they break don't lead to dangerously incorrect behavior. This is the case here: If `_parents` did have more than 1 member, it would IMO be preferable to rather do the slightly wrong thing, as opposed to crashing the app and causing the user to loose their data."
"> The only time _binder should be null is when we're binding the body of an unbound lambda, trying to figure out the return type of that lambda. I'm not certain getting the binder from the compilation is the right thing to do here, particularly around speculation and potentially getting the wrong binder for such cases. Do you have any thoughts?

I believe an UnboundLambda itself holds a reference to a Binder, indirectly. Can we use that binder?

Aside: ^^ is wrong, in that `PackageName` *cannot* (reasonably) be set before the `XamarinAndroidApplicationProject` constructor executes (short of using Reflection to construct an uninitialized object, set the property, and the invoke the constructor…), and thus it'll always hit the `string.Format (""{0}.{0}"", ProjectName)` expression.

Couldn't this instead just become:

```csharp
PackageName = GeneratePackageName ();

"> Which fixers are those? Thanks!

@github I was wrong when I said 5. The other codefix cases with the batch fixer use `FindRenameLocationsAsync` and `ResolveConflictsAsync` which should be fine (as I understand it). However, there are two cases: `AbstractMakeMethodAsynchronousCodeFixProvider` and `AbstractMakeMethodSynchronousCodeFixProvider` which both use the batch fixer and the rename apis in this way:

My understanding is that for non-GUI, we would just end up with:

The only way I can imagine we're seeing parallel requests to load a file would be if the same file is being added to multiple projects which wouldn't share FileTextLoaders in the first place, but it's also seemingly very wrong that we're then reading it multiple times, since that could result in an inconsistent workspace.

Since the PR is back into draft state I can't remove my block: I sign off on the AsyncLazy change but I'm now suspicious we've discovered a long-standing issue with linked files that this may not help, and might indicate the fix exists elsewhere."

I agree it would be nice to do a little better on things like ``Uppercase<`a${string}`>``, but it would require the compiler to have built-in knowledge of the semantics of those operations which I'm not totally crazy about."

"@github The large number of JIT changes happened after I ran jit-format, but I think something may have been wrong with my version of jit-format as it kept failing CI/CD. Reverted those commits and re-ran with a known good version of jit-format, hopefully that resolves the issue."
"I also see this

">// (16,22): warning CS0028: 'Program.Main()' has the wrong signature to be an entry point [](start = 16, length = 89)

Please add a prototype comment to make this diagnostics more specific. #Closed"
"@github _Aside_ from the issue of path mapping (or more specifically, which paths we choose to map by default) I do not believe we need to prevent the search of parent directories for .editorconfig files by default. While it's possible for a .editorconfig file to affect a build, the conditions under which this would occur are unlikely, and all but impossible to result in someone shipping broken code.

Start with the first two mass filters:

**1. Most users will not have .editorconfig files**

These users are not affected by probing to the drive root.

**2. Of the users who have .editorconfig files, most will not have properties specified in them which affect C# compiler outcome.** Specifically, no properties previously defined on editorconfig.org affect which warnings are reported or the severity with which they are reported during a build

Probing to the drive root may change the set of .editorconfig files passed to the compiler on a local machine, but it will not change the build outcome (success/fail) or reported warning messages unless we e.g. add a new warning message for invalid .editorconfig syntax (which would be trivially resolvable).

Now we get a bit more specific.

**3. Most users will not have analyzers installed via NuGet**

For this category, even a custom pathological **.editorconfig** is only capable of changing the severity of warnings reported by the C# compiler itself. To break a build on a local machine, one would have to explicitly increase the severity of a C# compiler warning via a .editorconfig file which is not part of the project.

**4. Most users who customize .editorconfig in ways that affect builds will do so in the context of particular projects**

When **.editorconfig** is added to a specific project with root=true, searching to the drive root by default is not a problem.

**5. For the remaining user who wants to customize a build-affecting non-project-specific .editorconfig for some reason, they probably have a reason to do so and we have no real need to prevent them from doing so.**

Basically what this means is the only way a user can enter the scenario you were concerned about is if they take action with specific knowledge of the new system we are designing. The act of entering this situation all but ensures the user also knows how to get out of the situation if something goes wrong."
"In reality this file almost never changes because it's confusing to everyone when it does. I don't think you can do dynamic links here, but I've also never seen it cause a problem. I'd almost go so far as to say if it does cause a problem, we're probably doing something wrong anyway. 😄 "
">IConversionExpression (Implicit, TryCast: False, Unchecked) (OperationKind.ConversionExpression, Type: (System.Int32, System.Object)) (Syntax: '(0, Nothing)') [](start = 4, length = 158)

It feels like there is something wrong with this conversion node. It converts from (System.Int32, System.Object) to (System.Int32, System.Object), but says it is not an identity conversion. We probably shouldn't have this node in the tree at all. Please open an issue to follow up. We will have to create a new unit-test that gets the tree for the entire Dim statement."
"@github The use of the pooled writers comes at some long-term cost because there's now a lot of action-at-a-distance to reason about, and substantial risk of problems if we have any bugs that might leak instances in certain error cases.

I don't have a clear sense of what makes it necessarily the right way to organize it. Naively - and I know I'm probably wrong here - I would have guessed we'd just hold all the user-supplied objects in a dictionary, and then `<persist-component-state>` would serialize out the JSON directly to the response, without going through any other in-memory storage. Is it possible to give a brief description of why that's not sufficient?"
"> Any thoughts? One crazy idea I have is allowing changing the ""GetProxy"" name, so you could somehow configure the generator to use ""GetMyCustomProxy"".

Great point about collision. We can do as you suggested which can be hinted by an attribute. For example:
```csharp

[assembly: SignalRSourceGeneratorSuffix(""123"")]

[System.AttributeUsage(System.AttributeTargets.Assembly)]
public class SignalRSourceGeneratorSuffixAttribute : System.Attribute
{
    public SignalRSourceGeneratorSuffixAttribute(string name)  
    {
    }
}

hubConnection.GetProxy123();
hubConnection.RegisterCallbackProvider123(...);
```
^ I imagine we don't generate this attribute so the user would need to create one which can live in any namespace they like. As such it would be impervious to collisions.

I also looked into `internal` as you mentioned. There is a way around `InternalsVisibleTo` with aliasing however this would force the enduser to do `extern alias MyAlias` `using MyClass=MyAlias::MyClass` for every namespace or type from their dependency. This seems like a huge hassle. If there is an idea for a hassle-free approach, I'd be happy to look into that as well.

Regardless I think we should still make everything internal so chance of collision is minimized anyhow? (and the workaround is only needed when internal doesnt cut it)"
Actually... that might be wrong. IsReturnableConstruct considers individual accessors whereas you're looking at the actual property. I don't think this will work. Sorry :/

"an intermediary concept this PR introduces is that the two major clients of the diagnostics subsystem now pass in what behavior they want when calling into the DiagnosticService singleton.  

i.e. the normal push features call in saying `forPullDiagnostics: false` and the lsp system calls in saying `forPullDiagnostics: true`.  Internally we see which mode we're actually in and we either pass along the diagnostics, or  pass along empty.  in essence only one side will work, and the other will see absolutely no diagnostics ever.

This is not pretty, but it was:

1. the cleanest way i could find to keep both systems around
2. required minimal and mechanical changes to both systems.
3. ensured that every entrypoint was guarded so diagnostics wouldn't accidentally sneak into the wrong client.

Once we are entirely on pull, all the push components can go away (as can tehse booleans)."
"I added the mentioned .ctor  and .dtor

"> Given that I would expect that this returns a non-null value as the base type, or base interface, for i2 does implement this member. Is the doc comment wrong here or am I misreading it somehow? 

A declaration of a member in an interface is not an implementation. Also, even if a method was implemented by an interface (let's say written in C#), VB doesn't recognize those as implementations and would require a class to implement them anyway.

[build] Add support for NDK r23. (#6073)

Context: https://github.com/android/ndk/wiki/Changelog-r23#changelog

The most important NDK r23 changes for Xamarin.Android:

NDK r23 removes GNU Binutils.  We need to switch to using our bundled
copy of them, as per 27967cab.

Upstream NDK r23changes:

  * Includes Android 12/API-31 APIs.

  * Updated LLVM to clang-r416183b, based on LLVM 12 development.
    * [Issue 1047]: Fixes crash when using ASan with the CFI unwinder.
    * [Issue 1096]: Includes support for [Polly].
      Enable by adding `-mllvm -polly` to your cflags.
    * [Issue 1230]: LLVM's `libunwind` is now used instead of `libgcc`
      for all architectures rather than just 32-bit ARM.
    * [Issue 1231]: LLVM's `libclang_rt.builtins` is now used instead
      of `libgcc`.
    * [Issue 1406]: Fixes crash with Neon intrinsic.

  * Vulkan validation layer source and binaries are no longer shipped
    in the NDK.  The latest are now posted directly to
    [KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers].

  * Vulkan tools source is also removed, specifically `vulkan_wrapper`.
    It should be downloaded upstream from [KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Tools].

  * Refactored the toolchain file `android.toolchain.cmake`, basing
    it on CMake's integrated Android support.  This new toolchain file
    will be enabled by default for CMake 3.21 and newer.
    No user side change is expected.  But if anything goes wrong,
    please file a bug and set `ANDROID_USE_LEGACY_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=ON`
    to restore the legacy behavior.
      * When using the new behavior (when using CMake 3.21+ and not
        explicitly selecting the legacy toolchain),
	**default build flags may change**.  One of the primary goals
	was to reduce the behavior differences between our toolchain
	and CMake, and CMake's default flags do not always match the
        legacy toolchain file.  Most notably, if using
	`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, your optimization type will likely
	be `-O3` instead of `-O2` or `-Oz`.
	See [Issue 1536] for more information.

  * [Issue 929]: `find_library` now prefers shared libraries from the
    sysroot over static libraries.

  * [Issue 1390]: `ndk-build` now warns when building a static
    executable with the wrong API level.

  * [Issue 1452]: `NDK_ANALYZE=1` now sets `APP_CLANG_TIDY=true` rather
    than using `scan-build`.  `clang-tidy` performs all the same checks
    by default, and `scan-build` was no longer working.
    See [Issue 1452] for more details; no user-side changes should
    be needed.

☹️ Please no crazy extension methods on `object`. It was fine to ignore them previously because they were buried in an edge case namespace and only used by one project.
"> does ""ctrl+c/v"" still go through to the textbox when it's bound?

Ah butts. It does not. The `TerminalPage` eats it before the text box has a chance at it. 

We could manually exempt <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd>, <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Backspace</kbd>, but that's starting to feel like the wrong solution."
"@github for the design sign off, but _I_ sure think it looks cool. 

\<showerthought\> Plus, if it's detached, then we could add a little handle somewhere and allow the user to just like, drag it wherever they want in the Terminal. That would solve the whole ""dock to top"" vs ""dock to bottom"" debate! I'm absolutely not saying you should do this now though. That's just a crazy idea.\</showerthought\>"
"The test you have shows how it's inverted.  Yes, 4-1=3, but currently it's doing 1-4=3 which is wrong obviously."
"also, dumb question, but does your system make sure that if it *can't* get an INewDocumentFormattingService that that's ok?  we need to make sure we don't break F#/TS"
"Perhaps `precondition` and `sideeffect` are the wrong terms here altogether: what if we called them `relationCondition` and `relationEffect`? IE, `test` and `other` are related when `relationCondition` is true, and if it is `relationEffect` is the assignment that is executed?"
Ignore that... I read it wrong :)
"Yes, that is right. The old logic was wrong especially for Windows. We should always check `CurrentUICulture` instead."
"I did this only because the method below, `converter.ConvertAndTerminateString`, is going to do the same because we are going to pass the `path`, so I wanted to avoid the extra step of increasing its size.

Granted, this could be wrong. @github is this `stackalloc` (and the one in `ConvertAndTerminateString`) safe?

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/01b7e73cd378145264a7cb7a09365b41ed42b240/src/libraries/Common/src/System/Text/ValueUtf8Converter.cs#L24-L38"
"I think this code is to make `byte signature[12]` a string for exception throwing purposes. Why is it wrong for `signature[11] != 0`? "
"This was copy-pasted from seveal lines above, I am not responsible for this) I don't know how exactly this attribute works as I don't have much expirience in working with nullability. Can you tell, what is wrong here?"
"It is... complicated.

Logically, it is true for all non-shared (shared in the `__Canon` sense) fields, since they have unique identities (with one exception: overlapping RVA statics).

Implementation-wise, it is all over the place, I have a comment about it in the unfinished changes that captures the spirit:
```
// Ordinary statics select their types. ""Shared"" statics, however, select
// their version of ""the first field map"", which is then indexed into by
// the logical ""instantiation"" argument, though see below). Or, at least,
// that was the original intent behind the relevant logic.

// In practice, ""IsFieldAddr"" ""gets things wrong"", and we form selection chains
// that are too conservative/long. First, the IR representation for the ""boxed
// static"" case, on 64 bit, when not using CLS_VAR, makes us think that such fields
// are in fact ""shared"", and use the ""static offset"" selector for them. Second, it
// also makes us think the box itself is in fact the field. Third, only fields that
// logically are ""shared"" (between generic instatiations) need this ""static offset"",
// but all cases that use helpers will hit it, because their IR shapes are similar or
// identical. For example, for an access of a simple struct static field in R2R code,
// we will form this:
//
//   $staticOffset = CAST(heap[field][helper], ref <- struct)
//   $fieldValue   = heap[field][$staticOffset]
//
// This is not a correctness issue, as we form selections that are ""just"" too
// conservative, but it does make for a somewhat confusing experience, and leads
// to quite a bit if wasted memory and cycles.
```
You are right that this handling is incomplete, fixing it is WIP."
"Ah, well I guess this is an improvement then. Looking at the editor implementation of ECMD_TYPECHAR I guess it does forward to InsertText which is surprising to me. If you look at `TextTransactionMergePolicy` in the editor codebase it appears the requirements for merging are:
1. Both transactions were initiated through EditorOperations to get the merge policy. This argues against you having your own delete code (at least in some places. Others you're probably fine.)
2. The textual descriptions are the same.
3. Edits are consecutive.

In any case, I was wrong about how I thought the editor handled this, so I guess this is better than before. I'm still curious though why we're having to do so much work here rather than forwarding to nextHandler more.
"
why use a different diagnostic? the new one seems wrong here
"Fair enough; that's what I was getting at with ""easy to get the default wrong""."
"> But since no degradation is found, I don't see any issue. Is something wrong here?

I was asking just to make sure we were comparing apples-to-apples.  It sounds like it's probably fine. In the future it'd be good to rebase so you're comparing just the diff."
"> Note: i'd also be ok logging a watson. I'm not ok with throwing here as i think that would reflect a poor design choice for a componentto throw about incorrect assumptions it made about another component.

What happens if the code throws anyways because you forgot some check or made another mistake? To avoid crashing VS we need to have a recovery boundary somewhere upstream anyways, in code that implements the entirety of a user action (such as refactoring), report NFW there and perhaps let user know something went wrong without taking down VS.

As it is things will just not work and it might create confusion as how the feature is supposed to work."
"> Should I file an issue to refactor these as well to not use hard-coded mscorlib versions?

I don't think this is necessary. The way the old tests are written isn't necessary wrong, just not ""modern"". I also think that, as we speak @github is working on refactoring what references our tests are using. It is quite possible that the tests are going to be naturally ""modernized"" in the process."
"I like this proposal more than the other one. This is more explicit and less verbose. I understand the concerns raised here, but I think they should be considered features, and this should be used carefully by the community. I understand this is not always the case, and people could start using and misusing this for everything, but this is as for all the features that Typescript introduces. They are not always used as intended.

One particularly seems to be a good example of why this proposal is good for me. 

## Cross-library interop
Library A may have `type Radian = unique number`.
Library B may have `type Radian = unique number`.

And they _are_ different. Libary A can update is definition tomorrow to `type Radian = bigint`, and that would be ok. I understand that _if I have two nominal types, that both are numbers, seems wrong that they can't assign each other_, but is that what this is about? Having someway to declare a _unique type_?

If I can declare a _unique type_ that can be assigned to a different _unique type_ because they have the same shape, are they unique then? "
"> Mainly just to clean up the noise in logs

This is not a good reason.  The logs are telling us that something has gone critically wrong.  It is not ok to solve that by just having our code ignore hte issue.  If anything, we should be prioritizing determining the root cause *asap*."
"For one this being effectively a servicing fix - I would prefer it to be very targetted. But also, the function can fail for many reasons, and in those cases I think it's good to fail. The current experience on NanoServer or Linux is actually broken in my mind. There's no warning, but we produce something which will not work correctly. For example try building WPF app on NanoServer - the produces exe will be effectively broken (it will be CUI app which will show console, it won't have any icon, probably wrong manifest, ...)"
"Well, *return* types are checked without contextual typing: the following example has an error:

```ts
/** @github {(a: 1, b: 2) => boolean} Foo */
class C {
  /** @github {Foo} */ one (a,b) { return 1 }
}
```

That's from `checkReturnStatement`, which uses `getSignatureFromDeclaration >> getReturnTypeOfSignature`.

I'll see what goes wrong with parameters."
"> I decided to include ""A label is not allowed here"" because, even though it's not a runtime error on its own, if you use the label it will not be defined, which is a runtime error, and because the compiler error for the undefined label is so bad.

https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30408

> I decided not to include this error, since it's not a runtime error in ES2015 and above according to an SO answer I found. It's a useful error for TS, though; probably the error message should be changed to read ""An object literal should not have multiple properties with the same name."", or else it should be restricted to ES5-only. I filed #46815 to track that.

My 2 cents is to just make it a suggestion diagnostic - don't go too crazy with when and how to report this in JS, or modifying how it surfaces in TS."
"> and it's true that the msbuild task is using the wrong assets. In my case it's using C:\Projects\runtime\.dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\6.0.0-preview.3.21201.4\System.Private.CoreLib.dll but with the information that System.IO.File has been already moved to System.Private.CoreLib

@github was the one who brought the task over from arcade into dotnet/runtime so he's the right person to provide an answer. But to give you some more data meanwhile, the failing task isn't expected to run against the live shared framework as it contributes to the build itself. This is similar to msbuild and other tools that we use to build the repository which also run on a last-known-good shipped version of the shared framework (currently 6.0 Preview 3)."

```

but on CI it was failing to find python while it is clearly there, but when i worked around it, it is now failing with `Failed to get PGO data package path`. There is nothing in logs pointing to clues what's wrong, so it might be something specific to pipeline YAML that needs updating?"
"> It picks the same baseline for x64/x86/arm/arm64...so all the diffs are related to that baseline. The question is why it picked wrong baseline, perhaps we didn't catch up or something in jitrollingbuild? @github - any idea?

However, it appears that AzDO doesn't kick off the build immediately; I noticed a delay of about 10 minutes for this particular change. In a few previous cases for JIT changes, there were also delays before the AzDO job kicked off, and in those cases, another change was merged before the kickoff, and AzDO built that change, not the JIT change that kicked off the job. Because of this, when we upload the JIT to Azure Storage, we use a git hash of a non-JIT change, and when superpmi.py looks for a baseline JIT, it doesn't find the hash of the JIT that should have been built.

Summary: there is an assumption that the pipeline builds every JIT change at the git hash of the JIT change. That doesn't appear to be the case with AzDO. I'm not sure if there's a config to force that to happen. E.g., what if 2 JIT changes were merged at almost exactly the same time? AzDO should build both of them, but does it?

Possibly we could change the jitrollingbuild.py upload script to walk back the `git log` for the built change and use the first hash that actually has JIT changes in it, to work around this problem.

"> I'm not opposed to this change as this improves build time and also the confusion around what should I use when I have a single target framework in a project within the dotnet/runtime repository. The only concern that I have is that the only validation to avoid usage of these properties will be either a wrong compilation (which might drive people nuts to not understand why the right code is not compiled) or PR Review... but I guess it is fine and people can get use to using TargetPlatformIdentifier.

Correct. Such a change will impact developers and it needs clear documentation and communication. This change makes sure all usages of the `Targets*` properties are replaced correctly with `TPI` conditions. The motivation for this change is:
1. Allow libraries projects to efficiently/correctly target a single target framework. Today it's not possible for projects to use 
`TargetFramework` over `TargetFrameworks` even when only a single target framework is used: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/47155. Because of that, we add ~250 project outer-build evaluations (100ms in average per outer build) to the overall build. These evaluations impact both incremental restore, incremental build and the overall build.
2. It makes dotnet/runtime libraries use the same common path as our customers when a project needs to condition on platforms.
3. Tooling works best when we don't rely on global properties being set. Today, the `Targets*` properties rely on the `TargetFramework` property being passed in globally during the dispatch from an outer to the inner builds. During design time builds and eventually in other scenarios, the TargetFramework property isn't passed in globally and instead is dynamically injected after the first project's property group. This change will avoid the dependency on the global property and will better support tooling like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. Nasty hacks like https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/04bb6eb3f182c934466af9c6f3d5a9ce8efdf716/eng/BeforeTargetFrameworkInference.targets#L3 can be removed entirely.

> Also it is a bummer that to condition for properties we have to now use [MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier to get the TPI value, but for items we can directly access the TPI property. I think while this brings value, this will bring some confusion to the table as the Targets* properties are/where simpler as you didn't have to think much about when/where to use them vs now if I want to use it to condition a property I need to do a ""more"" complicated condition by calling an MSBuild function to get the TPI value.

The idea is that properties use `TPI` to condition on specific platforms (see PR changes) but whenever that's the case, a boilerplate line that initially sets the `TPI` property must be present. It's boilerplate, yes but I don't think it can be avoided because of msbuild's evaluation order. I don't see any inherent problem with that requirement as long as it's well documented and communicated: 
_""Whenever you want to condition properties on platforms, make sure that the `TargetPlatformIdentifier` property is set (see other projects or docs page).""_

To be clear, I don't think this impacts your change.  But we should follow up to make sure that either ProcessorAffinity already does the right thing (e.g. roundtripping it will always reflect the same processor group), or we use a different API under the covers that will, or we deprecate these members and replace them with ones not based on a 64-core limitation."
"> I had spent some time and implemented HW intrinstics for Min/Max and as asmdiffs shows more regressions I assume I did it wrong. I also couldn't figured it how to force the containment, I've always gotten something like this:

Could you share what C# code you're using to get this. At first glance this looks like it might be a loop and so the relevant data may be getting hoisted.

Arguably it's even preferable to do so, as it shows we're not doing completely broken things like tearing down the entire UI and recreating it after each click."

Specifically, because it sees the ```x =```, it assumes that 'x' is always assigned, and thus the change is safe.  But it's not.  Because the right side of the assignment executes first, and will do a read of the unassigned variable.

1. That sucks.  But it's also a very corner case.
2. We could consider fixing it.  Namely that if the reference is the left of an assign, that we have to ensure that the right side is fine as well.  Annoying, but doable."

"> Multiple ICustomMarshaler implementations don't return null or won't accept null. Many do.

The thing is, it doesn't matter as much that many do: it matters more that some don't.  The whole point of nullable annotations is to issue warnings when a caller is doing something that might result in unexpected failure to due nulls being passed as arguments when the callee didn't allow them, or when the caller assumes null won't be returned but the callee may return null.  If our goal was to avoid warnings, we could just disable nullable annotations altogether, problem solved :)

If I have an interface that defines an argument as nullable, callers of that method can expect they can pass in null and it'll be fine, but if implementers of that method then don't accept null, either they've violated the contract, or the contract was wrong.  It's hard in cases like this one where the contract wasn't clear and we then have to infer what it was meant to be and the harm that may come if we get it wrong.  When in doubt, we typically err on the side of providing the most restrictive for arguments (non-nullable) and most permissive for return values (nullable) because that more accurately represents to callers the contraints they need to work under, that an implementation may not accept nulls, so be careful, and an implementation may return null, so be careful.  We do that because _typically_ there are orders of magnitude more callers of a given override / interface implementation than there are implementers of it.  It's the reason nullable annotations exist, to help flag for a dev when something unexpected might happen.

I guess the plain linear scan you are addressing is O(n^2), and it can still be more efficient then allocating the unordered set. Yet this balance changes at some point. And I actually prefer to use the cleaner solution. In any case we are discussing the efficiency of in-memory deduplication (measured in microseconds), while this is immediately followed by execution of command, that usually spawns another process, creates and renders brand new session (measured in seconds)"

"I do believe that check is right, at least from the perspective of the Intel manual. 3.4.1.1 of the volume on Basic Architecture states:

When in 64-bit mode, operand size determines the number of valid bits in the destination general-purpose

• 64-bit operands generate a 64-bit result in the destination general-purpose register.
• 32-bit operands generate a 32-bit result, zero-extended to a 64-bit result in the destination general-purpose
register.
• 8-bit and 16-bit operands generate an 8-bit or 16-bit result. The upper 56 bits or 48 bits (respectively) of the
destination general-purpose register are not modified by the operation. If the result of an 8-bit or 16-bit
operation is intended for 64-bit address calculation, explicitly sign-extend the register to the full 64-bits.

Perhaps it's more that we get the operand size wrong for these instructions, or that we should have something representing the ""destination operand size""."

You are right, the root cause of this issue is that for `,` `argumentCount` increases to `1`. However, for string context `""/**/""` it should be ignored.

I had two options for how to fix this issue: 1. Add changes to `stringCompletions`, to decrement `argumentCount` which has `,`; 2. Change logic in `SignatureHelp` for `getArgumentInfoForCompletions` (I though about additional context option). `getArgumentInfoForCompletions` shared between `stringCompletions` and `completions`, and it seems incrementing `argumentCount` is reasonable here.

If the current changes are unacceptable, we can fix the issue using one of the following ways: 1. add an additional parameter to `getArgumentInfoForCompletions` and pass it to all chain of dependencies, or 2. directly in `getArgumentOrParameterListInfo`/`getArgumentCount` check if the position is located in the string (`isInString`). @github What do you think?

- TS can't elide the import or named import because the runtime `.js` might have side effects (`importsNotUsedAsValues`) or you might subsequently have [`eval(""console.log(AcBrowseToObjectType.acBrowseToForm)"")`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#preserveValueImports) (`preserveValueImports`),
- but preserving the import/named import is problematic because there might _not_ be any runtime `.js` or runtime named export.
- Currently, if you explicitly elide the import (`import type { AcBrowseToObjectType }`) or named import (`import { type AcBrowseToObjectType }`) you get an error (which this PR suppresses) if you try to use its (inlined) value (unless you `eval(""AcBrowseToObjectType.acBrowseToForm"")` ... or `// @github`).

"> Does it affect the merge duplicate phase? Would two methods compiled under different modules be different now?

I was worried about that, but this won't contribute to determining if a function is ""unique"". The only thing used is the ""method identity"", which is (1) the IL code, (2) the method signature + calling convention + CorInfoOptions + hot/cold region + jit flags + ISA flags.

SPMI basically assumes that if the (salient) ""input"" to the JIT is the same, it will produce the same output. It's possible there are other inputs that could affect the output, like the assembly, but it's possibly a trade-off between precision and SPMI MCH file size and useful difference of MCs.

`mcs -dump N foo.mch` for method context N. Then you'll see something like:

> Just that I know how to use this, can you give an example use-case? Can we use this with /dumpMap , etc?

I thought about adding it to `-dumpMap`. We do get multiple entries, which I believe is when we are considering inlining cross-module. E.g.,

```
GetAssemblyName - 5
0-GetAssemblyName assem-0000027B5D2F2700, value-28 'System.Private.CoreLib'
1-GetAssemblyName assem-0000027B5ED42E30, value-55 'System.Diagnostics.Process'
2-GetAssemblyName assem-0000027B7F8E25A0, value-86 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation'
3-GetAssemblyName assem-0000027B5ED417B0, value-140 'System.ComponentModel.Primitives'
4-GetAssemblyName assem-0000027B5ED42DB0, value-4 'Coreclr.TestWrapper'
```
(for `CoreclrTestLib.CoreclrTestWrapperLib:RunTest(ref,ref,ref,ref,ref):int:this`)

So we'd need a way to figure out which is the ""root"" assembly name to make outputting a single ""-dumpMap"" entry valuable.

> Does this work out ok for the unusual cases like stubs, LGC, etc...?

Are you worried that one of getAssemblyName / getModuleAssembly / getClassModule will fail in these cases (and spmi will crash)? I tried to make repGetAssemblyName() resilient to missing info. The others _should_ also be resilient to garbage, but I could be wrong. I can certainly trigger a collection on this PR and see what we get (beyond what I tested locally). Would we see these things in crossgen? crossgen2? PMI? benchmark run? all of the above?

The wrong holder was being used in DacDbiInterfaceImpl::GetNativeVarData(); change to NewArrayHolder.

Added new/delete operators to Exception so when it is thrown from the DAC and caught/deleted in DBI, the
correct C++ allocator is used. When the DAC is called by DBI, g_pAllocator points to the DBI allocator.

"@github @github @github

As part of work on #17552, I'm looking into the end-to-end flow for events and how all the types work. I might be wrong, but it *looks* like the extension methods in `WebEventCallbackFactoryEventArgsExtensions` don't get used anywhere in the code generated by the Razor compiler. It seems like the generic overload of the method is what we'd always use.

I did a bit of archaeology and found [a commit 2 years ago by @github](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/commit/98fe8a8328a0b41ac776a1ccdc71943de8093440) that first introduced them, with the commit message containing:

> The fix for this will be two-phase by first creating a set of APIs that
can be targeted by the compiler that has the desired behaviour and then
updating the compiler to target this new infrastructure.

It's quite possible that these specialized extension methods were only intended to be a temporary step, and have long since ceased to be needed. **But the other possiblity is something more subtle,** like maybe they change how the overload resolution works in order to produce better compiler error messages in cases where people provide incorrect types, or maybe they are only intended to influence intellisense in the design-time code or something. It's hard to say since this build (without those extension methods) and its tests passes.

If anyone here feels they know whether these extension methods or needed, or has a suggestion about how to determine that, please say so :) Since they are public, it's debatable whether we should obsolete them, remove them, or leave them alone, but regardless I'd still like to know what they are for and whether custom event args will somehow behave less well due to not having equivalent extension methods.

"This was broken before, but this is not the fix. The 0 byte read from the stream needs to cause PipeReader.ReadAsync to return a ReadResult with IsCompleted set to true.

This change does that, but in the wrong way. This calls PipeReader.Complete() which sets _isCompleted and causes IsCompletedOrThrow() to return true below.

The problem is this is conflating two types of completion. You need two completion flags: one for writer completion and one for reader completion.

PipeReader.Complete() should only be called by the *reader* once the read loop is completed. On the other hand, ReadResult.IsCompleted should only return true when the *writer* is completed. In this case, that's when Stream.ReadAsync() returns 0. 

Additionally, if PipeReader.AdvanceTo() is called after PipeReader.Complete(), which would likely happen with the completion of every Stream with this change left as is, PipeReader.AdvanceTo() is supposed to throw."

"So, again, you should put in the assert if you are making a strong claim that this is a *Requirement* of this method. i.e. if it would be a bug somewhere for someone to call this method on the BG thread, we should put in an 'assertisforeground'.  Similarly, if it's a bug to be called on the UI thread, then we shoudl hve an 'assertisbackground'.  if it's fine to be called on any thread, it should have an 'CanBeCalledOnAnyThread' call in it.  This is most important for sync methods.

The complaints about the asserts before was that the asserts were *wrong*.  Specifically, we were putting in assertisforeground in methods that should not require being called on the FG.  Async mehods, in particular, should be written to be callable by any thread thread (occasionally there are good reasons thsi can't be). If they then *need* to jump to the FG, they should make the appropriate jump (though, really, only if they're JTF ready, as this is super dangerous otherwise).  

So, i would boil it down to:

1. your async methods should likely not require FG/BG.  If they have an assert, it should be 'CanBeCalledOnAnyThread'.  Then, they bounce to whatever thread is appropriate for them.  i.e. GetDesciption should bounce to the BG since it can be super expensive.

"@github Thanks for the reply. 

> and I want to make sure you don't feel like we are just dismissing this opinion.

I don't feel like anyone is dismissing my opinion.  You guys have been great.   I understand that we are in forming/storming stage.  All good.

> Updating our code to modern standards has been a long and arduous journey, but we're definitely not all there yet (evidently). I think where we're mostly coming from is a very Windows-centric mindset, where we have a huge codebase with varying styles across all of it.

Too funny.  I am in the same boat.  I have been a working a large legacy windows-centric code base for a long time.   A few years ago we decided to go cross platform and start to update to Modern C++.   So we were in the same boat.  It has been a long road and obviously when you have millions of lines of code you can't clean it all up at once.   We started with a similar set of rules like you.  ""keep the code consistent, .....""  What we found was doing this is almost impossible.  It is really hard to say ""follow these guidelines for this code"" and ""follow these for this code"".   

In a nutshell this is what helped us get there.
1. Have a style guide and follow it for _all new and modified_ code.  The more detail the better.
I mean really follow it.  :)  This sounds funny but until everyone commits to it and understands it you will have issues. All devs/reviewers need to understand the Core guidelines (or whatever your coding standards are)  - this takes some time to get there but it is doable.

2. Compile with all Major compilers - Clang has great sanitizers, better warnings, etc...

3. Use clang-format! This will save a huge amount of time.  No more - oh you have an extra line here, you have the braces in the wrong spot, etc...  Also, be OK if it is not exactly the same as what you do now.  Believe me, it is worth it.

4. Setup external tools like the CppCoreGuilines analyzer / static analyzer - this sounds great but with a large code base, it is difficult to run the analyzer and fix them all.   In this repo you may be able to do that.  The terminal codebase isn't that large.

5. Document -  Contributing.md, style guide, Do's / Dont's, etc.  If everyone knows what the rules are then everyone will be more productive.  Also realize the community doesn't have the years of backstory that msft devs have.  (this is easy to forget)  Doing a good job of this will pay huge dividends.      

> There's #890, which is probably a good thread to copy most of this commentary into.

I opened this.   👍  For this repo to be successful this stuff is a must.  

You guys seem to have a good start on this and @github has a lot of this on his list. So you guys are on the right track.  I'm looking forward to watching this repo mature.

Even without that `<attr/>`, why can't [`android.app.WallpaperColors`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/WallpaperColors.html) be bound?

"Analyzers, CodeFixes and corresponding unit test projects are empty shared projects that were split out from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/41363. That PR moves a few IDE analyzers, code fixers and their unit tests into each of these projects. I would suggest checking out my branch from that PR to locally see the structure.

> So i attempted to move ISyntaxKindsService into CompilerExtensions. I needed to split it into two parts. One that just had the data, and one that extended ILanguageService. I then attempted to keep the second part just in WorkspaceExtensions.

> The problem here is that the CodeStyle.Fixes project references the CodeStyle project and the WorkspaceExtensions project. So there's now an ambiguity because types get pulled in through two paths.

I hit exactly the same problem, see my comment here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/41363/files#r376442419. In that PR I have moved all the public Option related types that are explicitly linked into CodeStyle project for analyzers (such as OptionSet, IOption, `Option<T>`, CodeStyleOption, CodeStyleOptions, NotificationOptions, etc.) into a separate namespace with an `.Internal` sub-namespace so that files in WorkspaceExtensions.shproj can appropriately reference the types from CodeStyle project or from Workspaces project when imported in the respective projects by having using statements conditioned on `CODE_STYLE` preprocessor directive. This is unfortunate side-effect of the fact that our IDE analyzers need to reference these types, but cannot reference Workspaces. I don't see a good way around this except the approach I have taken in that PR.
Note that Sam has been using extern aliases to handle similar conflicts in shared formatter code, but we cannot do so for the entire Code Style layer because VB does not support them, and personally I find them quite difficult to fathom. I'd rather have the duplicated types in CodeStyle layer be duplicated into a separate namespace.
My PR also adds a `BannedSymbols.txt` for CodeStyle layer: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/41363/files#diff-8747d0acadea5b353b1871784c14003c. This ensures that the shared files in WorkspaceExtensions.shproj do not accidentally reference the Option types from Workspaces layer when imported into CodeStyle.Fixes project - you should see an analyzer diagnostic on wrong API usage once that PR goes in."

Fix (2) has a lot of moving parts, so I'm less confident about it.

Some additional considerations:
- Our JSX test coverage has a similar character to our other tests, but more so: there's a fair amount of JSX but it doesn't cover cases you'd encounter in incomplete programs that well; most of the tests I wrote for this PR are not redundant with existing baselines.
- Both changes only apply in ""non-expression context"" (I don't know if there's another name for ""in JSX text, nested inside JSX elements"") so in theory they're less likely to cause problems outside.
- JSX parsing has been this bad for a long time, so fixing it is not urgent.

That was one of my original approaches, but Android still uses several Interop files in the src/libraries/Common/src/Interop/Unix directory (Dllimports into `CryptoNative_`), which would require splitting those files into the src/libraries/Common/src/Interop/Android directory as well, thus creating duplicate files. Renaming `CryptoNative` is more efficient in that it takes advantage of shared entrypoint names but is definitely more ambiguous and harder to catch. I suppose in the long run it's better to make the split between Android and Unix more distinct?

It does work with relative paths, only the path in REPL appear different (I had some other issue at the time, couldn't reproduce it).

"> I have thought that the packaging tools somehow extract the list of dependencies from the compiled binaries automatically when creating the package, but I guess I was wrong.

You are absolutely correct, actually. Tools like `rpmbuild` in particular, do a scan (I think just a plain old `ldd`) and add everything listed as an automatic dependency. It makes it much easier for the package manager (eg, `dnf`) at install time to then see that ""package X needs `libssl.so.1.1`"" and then install the OpenSSL package that provides the exact maching `libssl.so.1.1`, or otherwise error out at install time with a message about missing dependency. 

AIUI, Debian uses `Depends: {shlibs:Depends}` to implement a similar solution. Similar features for dependency-autogeneration or auto-detection exist in [ArchLinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Creating_packages#Checking_package_sanity) and even [Alpine](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/APKBUILD_Reference#options).

IIRC, that was the primary motivation of my request for a build mode that would link everything dynamically (as in, visible to `ldd`) instead of searching for libs at runtime and using `dlopen`. I had just moved from another project (OpenJDK) where these missing automatic-dependencies would cause programs that would install but would fail at run time with all sorts of unexpected errors.

If we were to revisit this decision, I wonder about this bit that @github wrote:

> This felt like a reasonable mechanism to signify that. The main downside is the RID graph becomes crazy then for nuget and all the restore logic, but for a distro build of the SDK this didn't feel absurd.

Do we really need to couple ""link everything so it's visible to ldd"" with ""needs a new non-portable RID"". What if we used `linux-x64` as the RID, but avoided `dlopen` anyway?

Like mentioned by @github there's a separate knob for using the system foo library (eg, `libunwind`) instead of the copy embedded in .NET that distro packagers may or may not adjust."

"@github do you think you could could cast your expert eye over the approach these tests take? They basically use the MSBuild apis to do an in-proc build of the test project and check the state of various collections after executing.

They stub out `WriteLinesToFile` (the only place we touch the disk in the targets we're testing here) so that they should be side effect free. 

Ideally i'd like to expand our testing of other targets to do something similar, so want to make sure this isn't a _totally_ crazy idea."
"> I am just trying to understand why the code is written this way here. Could you, please, help me out with that?

The compat council's decision means that we do not emit methodimpl in the ambiguous scenarios unless supported by the runtime. That is the *true* branch of the conditional. The false branch of the conditional simply checks if the runtime's unambiguous override candidate is the same as the language one. Methodimpl works on all runtimes for that scenario as far as I know.

> At first, the logic feels wrong because we might not emit a MethodImpl for true covariant return case with ambiguous runtime override. 

We only support covariant returns when targeting a platform that supports covariant returns. I don't think that needs additional documentation.

> On the other hand, could this negatively affect retargeting scenario when covariant returns involved?

This code is only when emitting the source method, and for the metadata properties of a source method. I don't think it can affect the properties of a retargeting method (which mirror the same metadata properties that would arise on the underlying method if emitted).
I don't think we intend to support retargeting a method that uses covariant returns to a runtime that does not support them. I don't think any small adjustment here could make that work.

"> Does it really worth?

I think so. Without any checks there can be scary effects like described in #41146. Even with wrong user code that should not happen.

I was thinking about try/catch. But it won't work for all cases (e.g. assign null to non-nullable value-typed member) where the non-emitting reflection code doesn't throw but silently changes null to default(T) - but maybe that's desirable?. It would be difficult to get the right exceptions because reflection code and emitted code throw different exceptions.   "
"Yeah, crazy, right? That's because there is no `AppCompat.LabelRenderer` and `AppCompat.ImageRenderer`. Those are still using the legacy legacy renderers (Pre-AppCompat), and those are registered in the forwarders via attribute.

This isn't confusing at all. 🤦‍♀️ "
"Yup. I couldn't see a good way of making the behavior match. I don't think there's anything wrong with fetching an AssemblyName, so I don't think that should throw, but since the AssemblyName doesn't have a pointer back to the Assembly there's no way to hook just the CodeBase API, aside from doing something drastic like subclassing AssemblyName just for this scenario.

Open to alternatives though."
"We're both wrong :)

The problem is that the header/footer views aren't being added as children of the CollectionView, so they aren't getting the BindingContext from the CollectionView, or the FlowDirection, or Visual. So AddLogicalChild is what we're looking for."

I like the alignment of the low-byte being the same.

It's a shame Windows Explorer doesn't appear to know how to render that character. I'm not sure how it _could_ but even so. (Edit: ~~perhaps I'm being dumb, and the middle-dot _is_ a rendering for this character. I had assumed it was a 'unknown character' marker...~~ Other random PUA characters render the same.)

What happens if you use the character `` in a filename inside WSL? ^_^

Edit: I tested this, because I was curious. It's ending up at `\` on disk, i.e. the characters `\` and `` in WSL2 both end up as `\` on-disk under `/mnt/c/` (i.e. via the mount from Windows), and in Windows all are shown as as ``. On the Windows side, only `` can be used, and it appears back as `\` on the WSL side. On the Linux-local filesystem, `\` and `` are separate files, but _both_ appear as `` when accessed through the `\\wsl$` UNC path in Windows Explorer. At that point, things go a little weird (renaming a file or folder with `` reports ""file is too big for the disk""), so probably avoid using literal `` inside WSL."

A case where you have a Solution snapshot, and keep forking it with alternate edits to A.cs and B.cs won't consolidate those together with this, even though the earlier replacements don't really matter.

1. Replaces the contents of A.cs.
2. Removes A.cs.
3. Adds A.cs back with the same document ID.
4. Replaces the contents of A.cs again.

FWIW, replacing files in all the right places is overwhelming, and after spending enough time playing trial and error with msbuild verbose logs, it still didn't work for me (i.e. nuget cache was hit or wrong bin folder got picked up during one of the build/pack step and ended up testing the [wrong binary](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/67232#issuecomment-1090036551)).

This is causing tsconfig.json files with referenced config json files within the workspace, to be invalid, only in tsserver somehow.

I tried and succeeded in fixing this issue locally by unplugging typescript and making a slight modification to this function -

```ts
const getPnpPath = (path: string) => {
    if (pathIsAbsolute(path)) return path; // intended compiled code - `if (ts.pathIsAbsolute(path)) return path;`
    try {

        return pnpApi.resolveToUnqualified(targetLocator.name, `${basePath}/`);
    } catch {
        // something went wrong with the resolution, try not to fail
        return path;
    }
};

It seems to be a legit operation if e.g. `T extends **object** ? keyof T : never` instead of `T extends [some union]/ unknown ? keyof T : never`.

So my working solution is to guard against return `IndexType` if the above conditions are met.

I place the logic at `getTrueTypeFromConditionalType`.

However, I am quite new to this and I am not quite sure:

1. that `getTrueTypeFromConditionalType` is the right place to place the logic; and
2. what is the right type to return in place of `IndexType` (I am returning `UnknownType`)

> Thanks for the workaround code. I don't like duplicating the logic of the ""internal representation"" of Apple EC keys, but I think I see a path forward from that.

Not a big fan of it myself but I wanted to unblock the PR.

I've tried to implement other options from the list but they were quite a big mess. The iOS-style keys only support X.963 format export, the legacy `SecItemExport` API doesn't work for them at all. That basically ruled out handling the situation in native code because it would get too complex. So next best thing is handling it in the managed part of the code and taking different path for iOS-style keys and the CSSM ones. The key type can be inferred by calling `SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation`, fails for CSSM keys and succeeds for iOS-style ones.

1. This is going in a patch, so the version would be something like `RoutingBehavior_5_0_1` which is ridiculously ugly to put in the default template

My proposal here of calling it `PreferExactMatches` has the benefits:

* It doesn't look particularly unpleasant in the default template. It sounds like a good thing, which it is.
* Even after we retire the option in 6.0 and remove it from intellisense, we can continue to allow people to pass  `PreferExactMatches=""true""` (that just becomes a no-op, whereas `PreferExactMatches=""false""` becomes an error). It doesn't make anyone's code look wrong to have this still in it, plus it doesn't imply the person *only* wants 5.0.1 behaviors and not newer ones
* If we ever need to fork the logic again, we can use the same pattern of naming the new option after its own behavior, and that's independent of this."

"> The indentation is always correct at 4 spaces (the only real exception in C# code is LINQ queries). Others are occasionally acceptable as well, but 4 spaces is never wrong.

Indentation of subexpressions within parenthesized expressions should align.  Otherwise you end up with code that is **super** confusing.  Is the subsequent boolean clause a sibling of the first preceding clause?  Or is it a sibling of a nested clause?  i.e.  when i see:

```c#
if (!(a...
    && b
```

my brain immediately starts pulling this apart as   ```!(a...```  as one clause and ```b``` as hte other. Alignment across lines is *very* often used to indicate structural association.  

But that's not hte case here.  ```&& b``` is associated with ```a``` and the ```!``` affects all of it. 

This is one of hte reasons i often push on people to not create overly complex boolean expressions as they end up hard to parse and hard to maintain over time.  To me, i would prefer something like:

```c#
if (!(n is ...
      id...)

Or, alternatively, just do:

```c#
var identifierNameMatches = n is IdentifierNameSyntax id && id.Identifier.ValueText.Equals(identifier.ValueText);

"I thought about it again and realized that I didn't do a detailed explaination for the tokenization idea, sorry for that.

The reason that we can use `isCheapToTokenize` to reduce the time is there are always tokens generated for the viewport (introduced by Alex's recent changes). Whenever we open a file, scroll to some pages, we will tokenize the viewport based on some heuristics. It doesn't mean they are 100% correct, but almost. So if the viewport is cheap to tokenize, then we force tokenize them. If not, we don't do anything, just read the tokens by `getLineTokens`.
 
`isCheapToTokenize` is `false` in following two major cases

1. if the previous line of a position is not tokenized or invalid (for example, it has dirty changes)
2. if current line is really long

So say you debug into a new file, the editor tokenizes the viewport internally (99.9% correct), and then start a full document tokenization in the background. If now you ask the editor if the viewport is cheap to tokenize or not, it depends on how fast the background tokenization runs.

Since we are only fetching `word` information here, there are fewer chances that the tokens are siganificantly wrong. I'd like to propose

* Check if the `visibleRange.startLineNumber` is easy to tokenize or not
* If so, tokenize the viewport only. (We don't need to `tokenizeCompleteDocument` as there is already a background job for that)
* If not, just read the tokens, they are very unlikely to be wrong, for word information"

"> What problem are you trying to solve?

To undo any changes running inline has on the sync context.

> Would that opaque struct help with the ASP.NET use case in some way?

It would help with `MRVTSC` because it wouldn't need to mess with sync context directly.

It wouldn't help with ASP.NET because it doesn't care about the return value (it's one way, just trying to restore single previously captured context) or the sync context.

Whereas `MRVTSC` does operate as a stack; restore captured context, do work, restore current context.

ASP.NET is more: do work, restore context (because I don't trust the work to guard asynclocal changes inside `await`s); i.e. restore clean context at end of request loop ready for next request (and there are two examples of it going wrong this way dotnet/aspnetcore#15384 and dotnet/aspnetcore#13991)

The current ASP.NET solution is to move the 3 user calls out behind a new `async` method and let `AsyncMethodBuilderCore.Start<TStateMachine>` handle returning the ExecutionContext back to default.

However, that both introduces a new async statemachine and an extra allocation if any of the methods suspend and its a bit heavyweight just to reset the EC. 

So next thought would be to guard them with `EC.Run`; but then what Task to return and await, since there are 3 of them; if they all complete sync, then can in some way return a CompletedTask; but that's complicated since its callback based (e.g. via the `ref` param); but if one goes async other than the very last one, suddenly it becomes complicated; etc.

If there is a `EC.Restore` on the other hand, can just inline all the awaits into the single method; and don't need an extra startmachine to handle resetting the EC at end of request and don't allocate anything extra if they suspend (since the loop statemachine is already allocated as it likely suspends between requests waiting for the next one)

"> I'm gonna go ahead and ask the dumb question: Why can't we _automatically_ derive the constraint of an inferred type binding from the constraint of the type being matched?

We do have automatic inference, and there are ways we can improve it. However, that still wouldn't solve the issue at hand. There are times where you need a more-specific type than what the inferred constraint might allow:

```ts
type X<T extends any[]> =
  T extends [infer U extends string, ...infer R] ? ... :
  T extends [infer U extends number, ...infer R] ? ... :

Above, I might want to make branching decisions based on a more specific constraint. This also ties into #48094, which uses more specific inferences for `infer` in a template literal type to pull out numeric literals. "

"@github @github @github I need your feedback on an issue I am seeing in the test run regarding the change here. If we have the following code and running it without my changes:

```C#
            var attribute = new TimersDescriptionAttribute(null!); // passing null for description
            string s = null;
            try {s = attribute.Description; } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine($""{e.Message}""); } // accessing attribute.Description first time throw argument null exception
            s = attribute.Description; // access it second time will not throw :-(
``` 

This is happening because of the code https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/8e624b33465546e9d05da2afea5faea233d9f847/src/libraries/System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter/src/System/Timers/TimersDescriptionAttribute.cs#L40 We are calling `SR.Format(string)` which will call [internal static string Format(string resourceFormat, params object?[]? args)](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/8e624b33465546e9d05da2afea5faea233d9f847/src/libraries/Common/src/System/SR.cs#L78) passing empty args array and then later will throw when trying to format the string. 
With my changes, I removed the `SR.Format` as @github suggested and now we are not throwing it at all. Obviously, the current behavior is wrong. we have the following options:
- Throw in the attribute constructor when passing null parameter. This is the option I prefer. 
- Don't throw at all and allow `null` description. This is the behavior with current changes.
- Keep the current behavior which throw first time trying to access the description and never throw again.

@github how about implementing a reference counter? If I'm not wrong `Comet` has this implemented. If that's a simple implementation we can add this to .NET MAUI and call the `DisconnectHandler` when we don't have anymore references at all.

"I've looked at all the places where equals could be used, the only places that take user input are the DisconnectCircuitMiddleware and ConnectAsync inside the CircuitRegistry, in both cases we do validation of the ID first, so further uses of method are fine.

That said, I think in principle we should change this to use the hash of the circuit for a couple of important benefits:
* We always have a way of going from Secret to ID, which guarantees that a secret and its ID are always paired and there are never mismatches or can be easily detected. (The ID becomes a computed field). This allows us to log based on the ID in all circumstances.
  * No need to enable tracing in logging (which our customers are likely to get wrong and spam their logs with all traces for the server, for example Kestrel will log all the bytes coming in and out). As to do this selectively you would need to use a filter, which is somewhat advanced.
* It allows us to use the ID in all circumstances to do lookups and other operations and allows a safe implementation for Equals and GetHashCode in this type, as even if you are able to figure out the hash for a secret, you don't learn any information about the secret itself (Thanks to hashing being a one way function)."

"> Instead of validating the contents of the cache when we download bits from the network, can we validate them when we load them from the cache?

That seems strictly worse to me. We're then doing the hash check on every load instead of only when the data was first acquired. We still have to do it on the first load when it comes from the network too (see below).

> It is very unlikely that you end up in a situation where the manifest doesn't reflect the contents of the server or that you can't trust the manifest (it's your app, you are serving it).

It will certainly happen sometimes. It's always possible during deployments that a user fetches `blazor.boot.json` from the old version of the site and some assemblies from the new version.

> Worst case scenario, your app is in the middle of a deployment and you got the wrong contents, the likely outcome is that your app will crash and the user will have to reload (this problem is orthogonal to what we are trying here)

Doesn't seem like an orthogonal problem to me. The scenario this code deals with is acquiring the resources and verifying they are the ones we want. I don't see any benefit in letting the app start up with the wrong resources, performing whatever undefined behavior this leads to for some period, and then hoping we can shut it down later and hope we get to run more logic to clean up the polluted cache.

> If you want to do this validation, then do it over the cached data the first time you load from cache and ""repair"" purge the entry from the dll once you detect that scenario.

I definitely think we should validate the data the first time it comes from the network, for the reasons mentioned above. And then having done that and cached it under a key derived from that hash, there's no purpose in revalidating it again later."

"> Do you know why it is that System.Runtime.dll and netstandard.dll are unifying here? Is there a type-forwarding situation going on?

Yes, this is type-forwarding. For netstandard from netframework (or even netcore) reference binaries are added to do type-forwarding so `netstandard.dll` types can resolve to the equivalent type. I had an easier time viewing this in netframework build outputs. One of the referenced files is `{VsInstallPath}\MSBuild\Microsoft\Microsoft.NET.Build.Extensions\net461\lib\netstandard.dll` which contains all of the type forwarding. I'm not quite sure how it's done with netcore (I didn't look heavily), but I imagine there's something similar. 

> I guess my poitn is this. If we are considreing these symbols from different compilations equivalent (which seems to be how the compiler would view things), then we should update our helper to properly encode the right logic that makes it agree with what the compiler would think. I don't think that's necessarily IgnoreAssembliesInstance, however it might be something else.

This IS that something else. Is it just that it's not part of statics exposed by `SymbolEquivalenceComparer`? 

To me this is just swapping the wrong call to the right one. If the logic isn't in the right place, then I guess moving it would be okay? I don't feel strongly one way or another. 

I think `SymbolEquivalenceComparer` does the advertised thing and works in the expected way; you compare with a requirement for same assemblies or you compare without. I'd even be willing to move this code to calling it directly. Like I said, I just chose an example from something similar and went with it because it looked like `SymbolEquivalenceComparer` + some extra checks to ensure type forwarding is considered. "

">AssertSignatureHelpEquals [](start = 12, length = 25)

Seems a bit verbose to have to write all the Assert*Equal methods to validate the results. 
Sometimes it is easier to write an inspect method that formats the interesting properties of the objects to strings and then compare strings. 
E.g.: 

[https://github.com/tmat/roslyn/blob/EncManagerUpdateP2/src/EditorFeatures/Test/EditAndContinue/EditSessionActiveStatementsTests.cs#L278-L286](https://github.com/tmat/roslyn/blob/EncManagerUpdateP2/src/EditorFeatures/Test/EditAndContinue/EditSessionActiveStatementsTests.cs#L278-L286)

This makes it also easier to see what's wrong if the test fails."
"> This looks wrong. Editorconfig should override compilation-wide settings.

This was done to match current compiler logic. If you have a compilation-wide suppression entry for ~~any compiler warning OR~~ enabled by default analyzer diagnostic in ruleset or via /nowarn, and an explicit entry in editorconfig that is not ""none"", the diagnostic is not reported."
"Interesting.  I did notice in a different project yesterday that CA2007 was being flagged as warn as error.  Something seems wrong with the CI state of this PR /cc @github, only 9 checks."
"Using a TFM which targets a specific runtime versus netstandard is not the same thing as treating classlib and app the same way. As you note it was always possible to target classlib for a specific runtime, that's not the limitation. The limitation is that SDK simply doesn't officially support building SCD classlib projects. In a way even `dotnet publish` is sort of weird on a classlib (and has several really weird behaviors). All of this is mostly because nobody went and made sure that SDK has this scenario cleaned up. Introducing support for this in the hosting layer feels wrong if we don't have a good story how to build such a thing.

You're right that we might need to block one of the other supported delegates from this new scenario. But most of them should work. There's a separate question if we should support them there - as COM/WinRT/IJW should never run into the new scenario as those entry points will always go through the `hostfxr_initialize_for_runtime_config`. So maybe it would be better to block those cases (just to avoid having to support weird configurations into the future).

I don't think the block in `hostfxr_initialize_for_runtime_config` is artificial. Removing it is actually quite a bit of new work if we were to support comparable behavior to FDD. Currently this entry point ""promises"" to not load any application code into the default ALC (to avoid version collisions with potential future loaded components). If we were to maintain that promise we would have to implement the split between app/framework assemblies for SCD (per our other discussion - the `runtimepack` value) and split loading that way. On top of that we would have to support then loading what looks like an SCD component into a secondary load context - currently `AssemblyDependencyResolver` assumes that files next to the component being loaded (and mentioned in its `.deps.json`) are part of the component - but for SCD this would be true for the entire framework. So we would have also implement the support for recognizing framework assemblies in `AssemblyDependencyResolver` (this would be a good thing but still more work). I must also admit I'm a bit hesitant to go this way yet, as it would effectively mean splitting SCD into two halves and there might be small behavior differences which show up. Since this is not a primary scenario for us in .NET 5 (we don't have resources to put into this right now) I want to avoid opening too many new scenarios as there's always a bug tail to be fixed. I'm not against doing this in the future though.

Alternative would be to say that when used on SCD it populates the default ALC with the entire app. But then the usage of it would be quite different. Using the existing entry points which all load into secondary ALCs would be problematic due to potential duplication of assemblies (as mentioned in the doc already). And it would be rather confusing - calling the same function would rather significantly change behavior based on what is the input (not the parameters to the function). This would potentially open weird scenarios in COM/WinRT/IJW as all these entry points call the `hostfxr_initialize_for_runtime_config` and if given SCD-like input would get the new behavior and at the very least get confused."
i thought i found all these :)  must have something wrong with my analyzer :)

">CheckValue [](start = 35, length = 10)

Addition of this call here feels premature and inconsistent with how we deal with binding of a regular member access. Specifically, in case of ```TypeOrValueExpression```:
```
                    case BoundKind.TypeOrValueExpression:
                        {
                            // CheckValue call will occur in ReplaceTypeOrValueReceiver.
```  
It is quite possible that we are missing to call CheckValue at some point, but it feels like that should happen later in the pipeline. Addition of a new BindValueKind just to accommodate this call site feels suspicious and, for me, is one of the indicators of possibly doing work at wrong time/place. #Closed"
"Most editors overwrite a file when they save, which requires write sharing. Some (vim?) apparently *delete* an existing file first [1]. In Windows 10+, `DeleteFileW()` has been updated to try a POSIX delete. If the filesystem supports it, already open files can continue accessing the original file, even though it's unlinked from the directory. (NTFS renames the deleted file to the reserved directory ""\\$Extend\\$Deleted"".) If a POSIX delete isn't supported, the file is marked as deleted, but not unlinked, and the name is inaccessible for new opens until all handles for existing opens have been closed. In either case, existing opens have to share delete access. Otherwise `DeleteFileW()` will fail with a sharing violation.

[1] IMO, deleting the file is wrong. It discards all of the metadata -- not only create timestamp, attributes, extended attributes, alternate data streams, but also the security descriptor, including the owner, mandatory and discretionary permissions, integrity level, security attributes, and access auditing."

"OK, I've just tried with `DXGI_FORMAT_R8_UNORM` now and that appears to work fine. I have no idea what I was doing wrong before. I think I might have originally been using it as a render target, so maybe that was the difference. Anyway I'll update it now. Thanks for bringing that up."
"so this is technically a bit unclean, but *hopefully* not a problem.  THe main issue is that this makes attribute parsing context sensitive.  We generally like avoiding that as it makes incremental difficult.  Specifically, it means we couldn't jsut say ""ah, we can reuse the attributes from a previous parse that are available in this location"".

In your case, i think you're ok.  that's bacause you'll have one of the two cases:

1. the attribute decl is on a lambda before.  so it will have the feature diagnostic on it, so it will crumble if we try to reparse it.
2. the attribute decl is not on a lambda.  it is reused in ParseAttributeDecl, but we still add the diagnostic on afterwards.

This is subtle though and easy to get wrong.  in general, it can be preferable to just do the parse normally and have the caller (i.e. this method) do the check. "
Really? wasn't this inside the OpenTK dll? (I could be wrong)
@github Yes I saw it and fixed the issue. It was about the SCW (?) macro change being wrong which I then reverted.
">  Is it because the actual controls don't have a size yet? 

Exactly that. See for example, `Pane::PreCalculateAutoSplit`. During startup, none of the panes have actually been added to the UI tree yet, so they don't have `ActualHeight`/`ActualWidth`s yet. There's some work that we do to try and figure out where the actual positions of panes _will_ be, based off of how big the window is, and roughly how much the pane will take of that window. The math sucks there though, and I was too lazy to try and figure that our for `moveFocus` at this time 😋 "
"> This seems like it would have a significant hit on performance. I could have sworn ConEmu only applied the algorithm to the initial palette initialization, but this looks like it's adjusting the colors on every color lookup in the renderer.

That's a good question; I understood it to be at render time for them as well (otherwise, they need to compute each color's contrast on each background and determine whether to nudge that foreground _only_ on that background or nudge it generally... potentially having to resolve a recursive conflict with other colors?), but I may indeed be wrong.

EDIT: Also, perhaps, to improve the contrast of applications that use true color? I'm not sure whether that is a noble goal.

EDIT 2: However, it might be a noble goal _if_ we want to add a feature for High Contrast users to actually induce high contrast in otherwise intransigent applications. (EDIT 3: Which I do -- that is an accessibility feature that could help people quite a bit!)

"That background out of the way, I now don't understand how this PR *works*:  `<GenerateJavaStubs/>` calls `ManifestDocument.Merge()`: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/main/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Tasks/GenerateJavaStubs.cs#L290

`<GenerateJavaStubs/>` also writes out the ""final"" `AndroidManifest.xml` file, and thus is *really* important.

`ManifestDocument.Merge()`, meanwhile: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/9add575ba0e25903b6894f40fcd53e6d51785fae/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Utilities/ManifestDocument.cs#L246-L260

`ManifestDocument.PackageName` is set by `<GenerateJavaStubs/>` as part of `ManifestDocument` construction, and thus ultimately comes from `<GetAndroidPackageName/>`, which is updated by this PR.  So far so good.

However, if `AndroidManifest.xml` *has* `/manifest/@github` value -- which it does for this bug! -- then line 259 *replaces* `ManifestDocument.PackageName` with the `/manifest/@github` value.  `PackageName` is never updated to take `ManifestDocument.Placeholders` into consideration, so my *hypothesis* is that the *actual* `AndroidManifest.xml`'s `/manifest/@github` value is *still* ""wrong"", not containing appropriately updated values.

Based on the unit test, this *should* produce a `com.xamarin.android.a.b-Signed.apk` file.

Once built, please read the generated file `obj//Debug/AndroidManifest.xml`.  I *think* that this file will instead contain `package=""com.xamarin.android.x__hello_.x__world_`, *not* `package=""com.xamarin.android.a.b`.  (Meaning that this PR only really changes the *filename produced*, but not the actual intermediate `AndroidManifest.xml` files.)

If my hypothesis is correct, I believe that the appropriate fix would be to instead update `AndroidAppManifest.CanonicalizePackageName()` to take a `string[] placeholders` parameter, and have *both* `<GetAndroidPackageName/>` and `ManifestDocument.Merge()` call `AndroidAppManifest.CanonicalizePackageName(PackageName, placeholders)`.  (The current `foreach` over the placeholders would likewise move into `AndroidAppManifest.CanonicalizePackageName()`.)"

"I'd make an alternate suggestion (and mentioned this to Cyrus privately): let's at least go through the current methods and stick TODO comments for which ones we think are violating but aren't immediately easy to fix in this PR.

I'd suggest split this change into removing method by method. I.e. Remove just DoubleToString and add relevant test cases. And do so for all methods you're replacing here. If we regress here we'll need to revert entire changeset here as I doubt anyone will be willing to spend time investigating what went wrong otherwise.

but it means INVALID_STATE is not only used if ClosedLocally; and it doesn't prevent stream_open from returning it later for some different reason....

On one hand, it will be better if we were able to tell the difference and not just translate INVALID_STATE into OperationAbortedException. This exception now bears the meaning of ""you do something that results in a local operation being aborted, e.g. AbortRead (or close Stream or close Connection) with a pending Read""; if we use it for something else it will become unhelpful... in the same way ""INVALID_STATE"" sounds unhelpful -- something is wrong but you're not sure what.

On the other hand, tracking all we do locally and adding the guards you mention might be too big and complex change, and if it would involve locking, it may significantly impact perf.

I was initially inclined towards not translating INVALID_STATE into OperationAbortedException, but I'm not so sure now.

"@github regarding Substring, there are only a limited number of things one can try to improve this, one of which would be to try and optimize the guard clauses. This would perhaps mean changing the exception messages (not types), since we would like to do multiple checks in one go for example, is that acceptable?

Other than that one might specialize for short substrings... if that would improve anything. 

@github the existing performance Benchmarks do not look that useful, at least in my runs they are highly volatile and seem to be based on JIT compiling away all checks... maybe... would adding other tests be acceptable? Perhaps you can take a look and tell me if I'm wrong, but use of `Arguments` seems problematic.

Is there any guidance anywhere on getting a good dev inner loop for looking at corelib asm? How to use BDN in that case? A bit rusty here. "
"As @github pointed out, the parameter name should flow through here. My understanding is that this is powered by the same mechanism as [CallerArgumentExpressionAttribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.compilerservices.callerargumentexpressionattribute?view=net-6.0), which is a pretty cool way to get the actual argument name string to flow through.

I thought I remembered that there was something in `GC.CoreRT.cs`. But it seems like am wrong.

With `git grep ""enum GC_ALLOC_FLAGS""` which definitely works better than the GitHub search, I only found 2 definitions:

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/1c927462696f5af7d5e667f54b1c39452cba4b2d/src/coreclr/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/GC.cs#L87-L93

I am currently undecided if we have any shared project for CLR-Tools code and the S.P.CoreLib where this could be added.

Since this is only tools code it will not reduce the assembly size for the user, but code duplication should still be avoided in my opinion.

Maybe we could put this under libraries/Common?"

`IF_DR_2G` `(mov sp/reg, reg/sp)` has an implicit reg2, so an unwary peephole opt
might mistakenly think it is `mov reg, x0`. If the opt is unlucky and the next
instruction is a real `mov reg, x0` the peephole opt might suppress the second
instruction, leaving the wrong value in `reg`.

Fix is to just disallow `IF_DR_2G` in the peephole.

Fixes #68527.

Any idea why the `coreclr_tests.pmi.windows.x64.checked.mch` TP impact is so high? Do we have some particularly crazy MD array tests there?
"@github - also FYI on this. Using the package APIs, which are all async, e.g. `GetItemAsync()`, would all throw mysterious C++ exceptions. I wonder if I'm running it on the wrong thread? (Which would be annoying, because nothing else here is async, and calling `GetResult()` is awful.)

Did you ever see any exceptions while using those APIs?"
"It's not changing the public API, though. It's just hiding the base class method. The tool is wrong."
"I do prefer it barfing to indicate a store hiccup, rather than giving what could be the wrong user"
"I added some comments, but on further thoughts I'm not sure this will do what we want when used in combination with the signalr service. The reason for it is that as far as I know the connection to the server will be kept alive in the signalr service case and only the connection between the client and the server will be closed (hence you won't get a nice disconnectedasync notification.

Am I wrong? @github @github "
"```suggestion
We may not investigate issues which haven't received many votes/comments and choose to close these. The reason is that the impact is very scoped and potentially something is wrong in the user code.

"@github 😄 

Not until now. I've written it to have the behavior you wanted where ""\*.example.org"" doesn't match ""example.org"" as annoying as it may be, because as I mention on the following line, the alternative would have ""a.example.org"" match ""\*.a.example.org"" before ""\*.example.org"", and that just seems wrong."
"Thanks for the feedback. I'm trying to understand how this is happening. stopConnection is only ever called when the transport fires its closed handlers. You can see where it's wired up here:

https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/88bf14399bb6c3557a73ce1a38ba7d7e9f27ac88/src/SignalR/clients/java/signalr/core/src/main/java/com/microsoft/signalr/HubConnection.java#L276-L279

At the point stopConnection is wired up as the transport's close handler, the ConnectionState is already in scope. That means we can fix any issues with a null ConnectionState here by simply capturing the ConnectionState in the setOnClose lambda and passing the ConnectionState as an argument to stopConnection. That way there's absolutely no risk of referencing the wrong ConnectionState or it being null. You could then verify the passed-in ConnectionState matches what's returned from getConnectionStateUnsynchronized() before calling changeState(HubConnectionState.DISCONNECTED) or mutating anything else outside of the ConnectionState object.

https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/88bf14399bb6c3557a73ce1a38ba7d7e9f27ac88/src/SignalR/clients/java/signalr/core/src/main/java/com/microsoft/signalr/HubConnection.java#L1482-L1487

That said, @github @github Do either of you have any ideas about how ConnectionState could be null here today? As far as I can tell, this is the only method that currently sets ConnectionState to null, and it cannot be called before it's hooked to the transport's close event which happens after the ConnectionState is set.

There are two possibilities I can think of at the moment:

1. The transport triggering stopConnection multiple times for a single connection.
2. The connection starting and stopping twice. If the first call to stopConnection is delayed long enough, the ConnectionState might have been overwritten by the second connection before the first call to stopConnection fires.

I'm thinking instead of just checking the HubConnectionState in start() we should also verify ConnectionState is null before continuing.

https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/88bf14399bb6c3557a73ce1a38ba7d7e9f27ac88/src/SignalR/clients/java/signalr/core/src/main/java/com/microsoft/signalr/HubConnection.java#L224-L234

Looking at all this also has me wondering what happens if transport.start() fails so the transport never fires stopConnection. Is the ConnectionState still cleared? It appears not.

"Separately, the current code here will result in extra noise in the normal (Arcade-ified) case because `msbuild` and `dotnet msbuild` warn when something tries to override a global properties.

> > can only be overridden when invoking an inner build using the <MSBuild/> task 

> What do you mean by this?

`Ms. Build` treats global properties (environment variables and `/p:Foo=Bar` on the command line) as read-only. The  `TreatAsLocalProperty` attribute is an escape hatch from that.

In any case, I'm glad this works but
1. Want to understand how much change introduced this or what else caused the new ""direct build"" issues
2. Very much do not want to make our binary logs noisier in the cases that are currently working.

I'm working on (1) still because I keep doing dumb things trying to get a binary log for the SignalR pipeline failures.

For (2), use `! HasTrailingSlash(...)` to reduce attempts to override a global property and a variant of the new line (perhaps using `NormalizeDirectory($(MSBuildThisFileDirectory), '..', '..' , '..', '..')`) in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Testing.props. May need to include an empty check in the `Condition` here because `Ms. Build` sometimes messes up when given a non-existent property."
"Is the lock really necessary? If we see a stale null OutboundControlStream, is it wrong to treat it as if it hadn't been fully created? I know this lock was there before and it doesn't really hurt if it's generally uncontested. I'm just curious."
"Do descriptions get converted into alt text for `""type"": ""computed""` symbols? I think the `""invertBoolean"": true` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/a0b950fc51c43289ab3c6dbea15926d32f3556cc/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/WebApi-CSharp/.template.config/ide.host.json#L46) really makes this confusing.

I think the alt text for both `DisableOpenAPI` and `UseMinimalAPIs` are wrong because of this `invertBoolean` logic. The alt text for the `UseMinimalAPIs` checkbox is currently ""Whether to use minimal APIs instead of controllers"" when it should probably be ""Whether to use controllers instead of minimal APIs"". It's a little more subtle with this phrasing, but it's essentially the same problem.

While we could just invert the descriptions in the `""type"": ""parameter""` symbol, I think that'd be confusing and wrong considering the inversion is happening in [ide.host.json](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/a0b950fc51c43289ab3c6dbea15926d32f3556cc/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/WebApi-CSharp/.template.config/ide.host.json).

"> This cannot be reverted without adding a warning suppression unless I hard code a new rule for this in the analyzer. Do you have a suggestion for a new global rule that would apply here?

```Is``` and ```IsNot``` operators in VB are explicitly reference comparison. There is nothing wrong in using them and I think analyzer should not complain about them at all. There is no confusion like in C# where ```==``` sometimes means value equality and sometimes means reference equality depending on the types involved.

You need to use `MinPairwise` here. You would use `MaxPairwise` if the element type was unsigned.

Lower Android versions are returning `HashMap` for `getColor` instead of `ColorStateList` for the `GradientBackground`, that's why `SetItemBadgeUnselectedColorTest` and `SetItemBadgeColorTest` are failing here. Didn't check if there is an alternative to determine the background color yet.

"Yes, the existing test was wrong given the change to the language specification.

We should always produce the same symbols and bind the same way, regardless of language version. The only thing that can differ is what diagnostics are produced.
For example if you used `record struct` in an older language version, we'll still probably produce a symbol with members. But we'll also produce a diagnostic. When you switch to a newer language version, the error merely goes away.

Regarding the present test: the `ToString` member should never be produced when the base type has a sealed `ToString`. But an error should be produced when that happens with a language version which isn't high enough.

That means that we could potentially do that, but that would basically mean drop Unix support for this library for netcoreapp 2.0 and 2.1 which IMO is not what we want. The issue that we tried to fix by adding support on Unix was logged in 2017 and has 250+ upvotes meaning that most likely there are NCA2.0 and NCA2.1 apps out there that could benefit by adding this support today, and it seems wrong to me to drop 2.0 and 2.1 just because of a tiny implementation detail which is why for now we opted to cross compile."

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/libraries/System.Drawing.Common/src/System/Drawing/Image.Unix.cs#L448 maybe the right thing is to return an error code from libgdiplus)

[Here’s](https://www.staging-typescript.org/play?exactOptionalPropertyTypes=true&ts=4.4.0-pr-45032-20#code/PTAEAEFMA8EMGMAuB5ADoglgewHawDYAKATlqpMYgJ4AqV5AzgFyiLECukAUDxjohQBmCSKACCARlABvLqFCwA-CwZs+Ac1AAfUDnYBbAEYUA3FwC+vfkJHiATDLkLloVcQ3bQhrFnyRYOGaWXHwCxMLwogBCoDACOAAmDOISADT2jvJKKmo46kE8CZDw+LDEon6IXixRZoYAdLCgALyg7ImQgnyQCWZAA) an example of a contrived program with one fixable error that turns into two unfixable ones upon being fixed.

```ts
// @github: true

interface A1 {
  a?: string | number;
}

interface A2 {
  a?: string | boolean;
}

interface B extends A1, A2 {
  a?: string;
}

declare let b: B;
b.a = undefined;
//^^ Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true'. Consider adding 'undefined' to the type of the target.
```

Fixing the property assignment adds an “incorrectly extends” error for each of `B`’s extended interfaces."

- [x] Simulator needs component dylibs
- [x] Strip things. Nothing's stripped
- [x] Catalyst has a different directory structure for dumb Apple reasons, and greatly complicates things because symlinks aren't allowed in nupkgs. Might need to hide the .frameworks inside archives of some kind (suggestions gratefully received)

Catalyst has this layout:

"@github 
I kind of figured out how to use it, but there are a few questions.

Is it right that I run asmdiff through this?:
> py superpmi.py asmdiffs -jit_name clrjit_universal_arm64_x64.dll --altjit -target_os Linux -target_arch arm64 -arch x64 -filter coreclr_tests

The same question is, is there an opportunity to run not all tests, but some specific one that does not work? This would speed up the work of superpmi, especially it works for a long time when you set the --diff_jit_dump key to get a dump.

After the first and second run, I had a situation that regression occurs in different files, and sometimes it does not exist at all. I ran the command twice in a row and that's what brought out:

[First](https://gist.github.com/SeanWoo/7ee7c42825a61d6c9b34e5dba0eabac4)
[Second](https://gist.github.com/SeanWoo/2ec3d7649ef14f72ae233e2cabc8447e)

It seems I'm doing something wrong :)"

# Customer Impact

The VS4Mac team reported that native frames missing crashreport.json causing problems with their Watson analysis.

The wrong module was being passed to the remote unwinder because the load bias for shared modules
was being calculated incorrectly.

Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/63309

# Testing

Local testing. Ran diagnostics tests against this change. Will get VS4Mac team to verify after this PR's build is finished.

# Risk

Low. It undo's a change/regression from PR https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/61063.

Fixes #67423


# About 

There are multiple libraries that have `ArgumentOutOfRange_Index` error message in their resource files. Even if it states that 
> Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.

1. In some libraries it's used even in the situations where index being equal to the size of the collection is allowed. 
 
  - `System.Private.CoreLib`
  - `System.Collections`
  - `System.Collections.NonGeneric`
  - `System.Text.Encoding.CodePages`
  

- [x] Every such library was modified to throw [appropriate message on appropriate occasion](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/67423#issuecomment-1085691457).

2. In some libraries it's used solely in appropriate case of ""throw if index >= size"". So the message is ok here.

  -  `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`
  -  `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs`
  -  `System.Security.Cryptography`
  
- [ ] But maybe for the sake of future development of the library we should split it into  `ArgumentOutOfRange_IndexMustBeLT` and `ArgumentOutOfRange_IndexMustBeLE` too? Just to be consistent throughout the repo.

3. In some libraries it's included in resource files but never used.

  - `System.Console`
  - `System.Diagnostics.Process`
  
- [ ] Should we remove it from there, leave as is or split it like in previous question?

# Other

### `ThrowHelper`

- [x] Some of `ThrowHelper` methods too were splitted into two. That's 

* `ThrowArgumentOutOfRange_IndexException`
* `ThrowStartIndexArgumentOutOfRange_ArgumentOutOfRange_Index`

### Docs

On msdn probably lots of methods with wrong `Exceptions` sectors. Like [`List<T>.IndexOf`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1.indexof?view=net-6.0#system-collections-generic-list-1-indexof(-0-system-int32)) here:

This one actually **CAN** accept index that equals to it's length. 

- [ ] I want to fix it, but I thought it would be quite a piece of a commitment, so decided to ask first: may I?

I see this brings in System.Graphics. We are in the middle of a rename Microsoft.Maui.Graphics. It really should depend on that. Also the MauiShapeViews are  using Platform Specific drawing layers. This is wrong. They should use the graphics layer. That way it will draw with any graphics backend.
It would work 99% of the time. The only time BaseDirectory would be wrong is when the app is published into subdirectory.

The JIT can produce better [machine code](https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgxg9gTgpgtADwGwBYA0AXEBDAzgWwB8ABAJgEYBYAKGIAYACY8gOgCUBXAOwwEt8YLAMIR8AB14AbGFADKMgG68wMXAG4aNYgGYG3XNgBmMJqQYAxCBAYBvGgwdNdwAJ4YTAQQAUvHg1y8AF4wAJT2jnbUjtEMru4AVAxiGFAMALz+GNhgANbYkpIQYLFuMADaAcEAuhpRMQ7EAOwM8clQtdEAvuEOPU4l7gwAQj5+laF9kfUOcTCJbemZ2XkFRQPlpACsSDV90U0tbR2O3XW9Zwxlsjm8YgAyRfm4AJJcvBhVfTrrDEKjGP4gjBAmELlNprN5ilFrgsrl8oVirMylsdsd6gdWil0QxTp0gA=) as with the constant (a power of 2) it's just a pointer move and zeroing -- except `[SkipLocalsInit]` then it's only the pointer move.
If stack-allocated to a `size` then the JIT has emit code that figures out the right size at runtime, which is overhead as it needs to round up to a power of two anyway.
Further note: small constant value (i think 16 is the limit) will be treated as ordinary locals by the JIT -- another optimization done.

> relying on stackalloc being zero-initialized

Good point!
Right now you can rely on the runtime to zero-init the stack-allocated content, as there's no `SkipLocalsInit`-attribute applied. But be aware of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/26586.

"making LanguageSettingPersister (or IOptionPersister) UI thread free is not small work.

I believe proper way to fix it is make IOptionPersister (http://source.roslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces/Options/IOptionPersister.cs,b13bd3bcaf4949ad) to be async interface.

and change everyone who using it to async

and then make LanguageSettingPersister to use JTF to lazily initialize it when they need it.

and caller (directly or indirectly through other service) on UI thread should change to use JTF.Run

…

any other way to fix it seems a hack such as creating yet another service just for LanguageSettingPersister so that it can queue actual work to other service which can have race (if someone ask option too fast, data is not there yet or if someone save data at wrong time, it doesn't get saved since VS passed shutdown time, or block shutdown time and etc which just make things more complicated)

…

anyway, I believe this PR is not trying to fix underlying option persister problem we have been having for several times now. 

we should have issue opened for this issue and there are other IOptionPersister issue (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/27677, https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/27678)

and fix it all together. and this part of code (UI, JTF) seems people having many different opinions.

so, we should bring this to design meeting and agree on how to fix option persister issue once for all.

"Hm, that's definitely not expected. A guess at what's happening- perhaps the cpp file you open finds the wrong `pch.h`, while the header finds the correct one. IntelliSense could then build a working PCH in response to opening the header, which could then be picked up by the cpp file when you return to it.

If so, one thing to double check is the order of the `AdditionalIncludeDirectories` list. Make sure `lib` is before the existing `..`. (Or even replace it, if that doesn't break anything else?) It might also help to temporarily disable PCH use project-wide and make sure the compiler can still find everything.

If that doesn't help, then maybe it's just some leftover state that would go away if you did ""Project > Rescan File,"" restarted VS, and/or deleted the .vs directory.

This can only happen on the first read through this loop, **but** just the fact that it is the first read doesn't guarantee we don't have bytes already buffered from previous read calls.

I think this actually ends up making the logic simpler, since you don't actually need to treat the first read and subsequent reads differently. You just need to fail the case when we readBytes == 0 but we already have some data buffered."

"> Should `sufficientFraction` instead be computed based on the number of cases...?

Maybe? Seems like 3 could be special case.

The likelihood needs to be high enough to offset the cost of the extra compare and branch if we guess wrong. So I think the likelihood should always be at least something like 0.3 and not go lower for larger switches. That covers switches with 4 or more cases.

We already specially transform switches with 1-2 cases in `fgOptimizeSwitchBranches`. We likely also handle case switches, though I don't see where we look for these.

That leaves 3 case switches. If we have a dominant non-default case over 0.3 and are also going to peel for the default then we're basically reducing the switch to a compare tree, but not getting the full benefit of doing so. I think this is ok for now.

-----

(Some other notes on switch peeling)

Ideally, once we peel, the residual switch would get simplified and perhaps some of this other logic would kick in and simplifies things further.  We could do this now if we peeled the highest numbered case, but not if we peel some other case.

Since we're always peeling the default (when lowering, so it would be peeled under any peel we do here), we should perhaps change strategy if the default case has a reasonable likelihood. For example, say there are 10 cases and the default case likelihood is 0.5, and case 0 has likelihood 0.25. We'd be better off first peeling for the default case. Once we do that, we can renormalize the switch likelihoods (multiplying by 1 / ( 1 - 0.5 )) and so case 0 relative likelihood is now 0.5, so we should peel for that case.

Of course once we do that second peel we can renormalize again and perhaps another case now becomes likely enough that we'd be willing to peel for that too. The rule of thumb I've seen here is that going up to 3 levels here can pay off (say the dominant cases are 0.9, then 0.09, then 0.009, these all become 0.9 with successive normalization). But I'm not sure we're ready for this just yet, as we also have to keep wonder how accurate our profile is when we start getting into the tail of the frequency distribution, and balance likely performance win vs code size increases. And there's some cost to having a high branch density.

"Don't get me wrong here, this isn't a technical limitation. The targeting pack is already constructed before references for OOBs are resolved. Projects can opt into not defining their granular reference via this property: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/fc4a42746d9cf65ad3db4074207069ab9c168bc9/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console.csproj#L8-L9"
">  I refactored this a bit, but I ended up that I'll need to ask the property whether it has a get accessor or not

This sounds wrong. If accessor knows whether its body is supposed to be synthesized and that is something that is known at its construction time, then why do we need to ask property anything here?"
elif TVOS but the string says: maccatalyst14.0 that will result in a warning with either the wrong string or wrong platform.

"Leaving a comment just to share a conversation I had in my head.

* Me: OK, this is changing whether or not we call base..ctor.  Why is that making me slightly nervous?
* Also me: dtor.
* Me: Right...  ok.. what does `new` do?  Allocates space for all the fields, runs field initializers... base to derived? Then invokes the ctor, derived to base.  Right?
* Also me: As far as I know, that's right.
* Me: K.  So if base has a Finalizer...
* Also me: which it doesn't.
* Me: ::eyes also me warily:: IF base HAD a Finalizer then the finalizer would still run, but without running the ctor.
* Also me: Doesn't apply here, but yes.
* Me: And that should, in general, be fine because a) if that broke something here you wrote the dtor wrong and b) we don't have a lot of dtors.
* Also me: You know that a finalizer and a dtor are different, right?
* Me: Yeah, I'm being lazy when typing.
* Also me: Continue, then.
* Me: K.  So this pattern is fine if there's no dtor on the base type, and if there is then maybe do a quick check to see if it does weird things based on base.ctor.
* Also me: How do you know if the base type has a 'dtor'?
* Me:  I'll... uh... know by instinct?
* Also me: So you're not gonna check.
* Me: I might.
* Also me: All right, then.

In conclusion: it's fine.  Probably always. But definitely here.  By assertion."
"My recollection (no, I haven't rewatched the video) is that this is supposed to be a friendly method.  Basically, on the order of ""back up this directory to there"".  If it returns true, everything's happy.  If it returns false then now I have to do something more complicated.  The copy stopping at the moment the first thing went wrong is super easy to explain, sure, but has low utility... if it long-path-name violated out on the first file but literally everything else could have succeeded, then the method has now annoyed me more than helped me.

Put another way: With no retry policy/error handler callback/etc, the method feels, to me, too trivial to be worth adding if it throws on the first failure (except for a few degenerate cases, like ""your destination is an illegal path"")."
The indentation here is wrong.
"This is wrong.

"Wut. That seems... wrong? The function is inline and anonymous, so it should be hoisted in declaration emit into a local member named `_exports`.

For this file, I'd expect declarations like
```ts
declare function _exports(p: number): void;
declare class _exports {
  constructor(p: number);
  t: number;
}
declare namespace _exports {
  export function Sub(): void;
  export class Sub {
    instance: _exports;
  }
}
export = _exports;
```
ideally. ...I guess it's fine? I think it's the reference in `Sub` that actually would trip us up, since we can't track the rename+hoist. If `Sub` didn't have a public reference to the exported class, I'd definitely expect it to be OK."

"Beyond these unit tests validating safe size, are we missing functional tests, i.e. patterns/inputs that would be producing the wrong answer on NonBacktracking before this PR?"
"It is currently not an issue because `impNormStructVal` makes sure to either wrap things with an `OBJ<correct handle>`, or spill to a local of the correct type.

The sequence of events where things would ""go wrong"" would be along the lines of:
1) We spill `Vector4.Zero` to a temp typed as `Vector128<int>`.
2) We forward-substitute into said temp. (which cannot happen today)

It is not a theoretical problem. I've hit a case #69965 that was similar in spirit (only there the handle pre-morph was correct, but lost after morphing the argument)."

"> So we write to what we hope is happening, but we are resilient to being wrong. 

I don't dispute this fact. I'm just saying I'd prefer throwing and catching an exception at one spot instead of having to propagate failure manually using TryXxx pattern throughout the code. I assume now that all the TryXxx methods only return false if the compiler does something we don't expect, but it's not obvious from looking that the code.

Couldn't you create `SyntaxToken` with invalid `Text` using `SyntaxFactory.Literal(..)` and pass it to the method?

Yes, I think it is. I have been using it as the source of truth myself :smile: I haven't found anything in it that's wrong.

I might be wrong, but it doesn't look like the test binds ```source``` against retargeting ```baseCompilation```. At least I do not see where we assert expected diagnostics for this scenario.

"I checked on the `isNewIdentifierLocation` as well and I disagree it must be true. This issue only happens for `js` files and when comparing against `ts` files, `isNewIdentifierLocation` still remains as false. `symbols` and `keywordFilters` are the ones that avoid returning early.

In regards to the tests, the completions provided are actually incorrect as the code would be wrong and not really access the property. i.e. in `completionInUncheckedJSFile.ts`, hello and goodbye are not related to the console object or in `javaScriptPrototype2.ts` the example is not really able to access to ctor prototype attribute so completions would be incorrect in my opinion.

"Hah, I'm actually XState maintainer 😅 In a way - I think that our types need a solid overhaul *anyway*. I wonder if there is anything in particular that we could take into consideration when refactoring, are there any particular things that we could try to avoid. While... we are flattered to be included in your perf test suite 😉 it's also a good sign that maybe we are overcomplicating things for the typechecker. 

Some recent changes to our types are in particular quite crazy (those designed to work with the typegen and have very unusual patterns used in them to ""stitch"" types together). My sincere hope is that this particular perf problem is not related to this part of the types as I took a loooot of time to get them working. Could you tell me against which version of XState are you running this benchmark? It would be useful for such information to be included somewhere in the result - as far as I can tell it's not in the comment of the bot nor in the attached benchmark file.

When it comes to the variance itself - I'm pretty sure our types ""get it wrong"" (from the user perspective). While I understand the concept of variance and can ""compute"" variance type in simple cases, I have no idea how I should think about it with such complicated types as ours, with a lot of layers, a lot of generics etc. Are there any resources/comments from the past that could help me understand this? Are there any tricks that could help TS to determine the variance type ""quicker""?

On a more positive note - I've tested this build and it seems to fix my minimal repro case reported [here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/44572#issuecomment-1042915921) and it also fixes the issue in our repo from which I've distilled this minimal repro. 🎉 "
"@github maybe it's worth adding this feature to the 4.6 beta blog post:

https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-6-beta/#control-flow-analysis-for-dependent-parameters

The blog post does not mention object restructuring, only tuple/union destructuring, but I checked the 4.6 nightly playground and it works with objects too now, which is highly anticipated by React users (more than the example showcased in the blog post IMHO)

---

Edit: oups actually I'm wrong it's not yet 100% good enough for React, and the following still fails:

```tsx
import React from ""react"";

type ItemData =
    | { kind: 'user', name: string }
    | { kind: 'company', id: string }

function Item({ kind, ...data }: ItemData) {
    if (kind === 'user') {
        <div>{data.id}</div>
    }
    if (kind === 'company') {
        <div>{data.name}</div>
    }
    return null;
}
```

But the following now works:

```tsx
type ItemData2 =
    | { kind: 'user', data: {name: string} }
    | { kind: 'company', data: {id: string} }

function Item2({ kind, data }: ItemData2) {
    if (kind === 'user') {
        <div>{data.name}</div>
    }
    if (kind === 'company') {
        <div>{data.id}</div>
    }
    return null;
}
```

Still worth highlighting that in the post :)

"On a desktop with tsserver logging enabled [1], I created a simple project, then opened a new Typescript file and pasted in some code [2].
I opened ajv.min.js, a single-line 121k file, and switched back to my test file. Goto-def was responsive after a second or so.
Then I opened Typescript's own run.js that we use to run tests, a 14 MB file, and switched back to my test file. Goto-def was responsive after 2-3 seconds.

- In both cases, as soon goto-def was responsive, the rest of the language service was responsive.
- Code notified me that it was not tokenising ajv.min.js, and there was no syntax highlighting.
- It took considerably longer to get quick info from run.js itself when I switched back to it. Probably another 10 seconds?

Based on this:

1. I think it's fine to proceed with the simple approach of requesting semantic diagnostics for plain JS files. If a particularly slow use case turns up in the beta period, we'll have a couple of ways to fix it.
2. I'll try to find out why grammar errors are in the checker and see how hard it would be to move them earlier. They make up about 20% of the errors in the checker, and most of the value for plain JS is probably in the grammar errors.

[1] So, faster because it's a desktop; slower because logging is on.
[2] Just some random code I worked on recently.

```ts
export class C {
    set x(...n) { }
}
declare var x: Promise<number>
await x
const y = await x

class Test {
    foo() {

    }

    bar() {
        this.blargh(this, ""completely wrong"") // Can't autocomplete second parameter

        const t = new Test()
        this.blargh(t, ""bar""); // Second parameter autocompletes to ""foo"", ""blargh"", ""bar""
    }

    blargh<T>(a: T, k: keyof T) {
        // some implementation
    }
}

const t = new Test()
t.blargh(t, ""bar"")
t.blargh(t, ""hi"")

The goal of this PR is change the current files to support the implementation of iCorDebug on mono:
- Split debugger-agent into debugger-protocol and debugger-agent, debugger-protocol will be used in the next PR in mscordbi implementation.
- Fix strings with the meaning of the commands, there were missing strings and then the PRINT_DEBUG_MSG was printing wrong information.
- On debugger-engine pass the offset of the IL when stop in a breakpoint.
- Created a new protocol major version to support the changes that we need to implement mscordbi.
- When mono debugger is started with server=n will waint until the timeout for a server to connect, this is necessary because depending on how we will launch the process with iCorDebug implementation, maybe mono will start before the debugger server(mscordbi).

Fixes partially issue #51564
(this issue is still under progress, more PRs are to come)

This PR makes the following calls compliant with Interop gudielines :

* Crypt32.CryptQueryObject
* Crypt32.CertGetCertificateContextProperty
* Crypt32.CertDuplicateCertificateContext
I know the PR should be small, but it's barely the minimum to move CryptQueryObject : this call uses many struct/enum/class and safe handles, that should either also be moved to Common folder.or deleted because they already exists there (so we need to reuse the later)

There's a change to CERT_INFO class inside Common folder, so it uses the created struct FILENAME (like CERT_INFO inside System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates\src\Internal\Cryptography\Pal.Windows\Native\Primitives.cs), using CERT_INFO with COM FILENAME causes overflows in tests since it uses int instead of uint.

I create this file Common/src/Interop/Windows/Crypt32/Interop.CertGetCertificateContextProperty_NO_NULLABLE.cs instead of reusing Common/src/Interop/Windows/Crypt32/Interop.CertGetCertificateContextProperty.cs because it's referenced by System.Windows.Extensions which does not support nullable yet

Sorry for the PR #60218 I was trying to solve a conflict by rebasing my branch on master and I did something wrong.

"macOS arm64 ABI is different in that multiple small arguments can be packed into the same stack slot. It means we have different behavior in some places in the JIT, and that different behavior was wrong here.
The behavior for the other ABIs did not have this bug."
"Hey folks this is getting really elaborate:

1. Is the string supposed to be UTF8 or UTF16 when it goes into the buffer?  all this talk of `wchar_t` is confusing.  We generally don't use `wchar_t` in Mono - we use `gunichar2` for utf16 and `ep_char8_t*` for UTF8
2. Is it important to use fancy string storage here? Anything wrong with just heap allocating a buffer?
3. If we need to use fast fancy storage, how about using a MonoMempool ?

This is all about improving the error message and providing more directed, useful, information to the person who runs into this.

"> Couldn't you create SyntaxToken with invalid Text using SyntaxToken.Literal(..) and pass it to the method?

Could do that.  We'll need a way then to *not* trigger the telemetry/watson reporting in that case.  

i.e. we need to still get info about when this happens in the wild, while not bothering to report on teh cases we're using in tests just to validate that our invalidation logic works.

--

This is all seeming exceptionally overwrought IMO.  There is absolutely no precedence for this afaict in teh IDE.  We simply do not attempt to construct/test things we don't think are possible.  Nor do we try to assume things not stated through contracts.  Things we hope to be true we code for, and we bail if false, optionally reporting the unexpected cases to us.

That way, when we're wrong about an invariant, things legit crash (possibly caught by a boundary exception layer), and we can get info in a non-crashing way for things we're uncertain about.

"> how do you determine what actions should be run as separate AzDO tasks and which should be within single task? E.g. you can argue that signing should be separate if you want to see how signing time has changed over time.

I made the determination based off of various investigations I've had to do over the past few years which required me to essentially analyze trends or flakiness across builds. The most notable areas where this occurs is restore, SDK acquisition and test duration. 

As for signing I've definitely seen that be a problem in official builds where the signing service has caused us enormous grief. I haven't personally had to track it down myself on non-official builds where we aren't hitting the service. If you think it's a source of problem though I can pull that out too. 

> Seems like AzDO is really not very well designed in this aspect. Either you put more stuff into AzDO tasks, making your YAML more complicated and your build not runnable locally, or you put everything into one script that you can run locally but can't get AzDO telemetry out of - or can you? 

Indeed this is a major tension point for AzDO (and looking forward GitHub Actions). Their unit of execution is tasks and that is where they primary reporting comes from. While we'd prefer to bundle everything up into a simple script and just execute one thing. 

> Aren't there AzDO commands (printed to the script output) that would allow you to answer your telemetry questions? So instead of merging/splitting build actions couldn't we report AzDO telemetry from the build scripts?

Yes and no. 

Yes: you can use logging detail commands to create mini records. Those are structured and appear in the timeline which means scripting data collection is pretty straight forward as it appears in the timeline data stream. T

No: this is basically completely invisible from the AzDO UI, it only appears at an API level. This means in order for developers to understand what is going wrong with their builds they actually have to sift through the build logs and look at the errors. Experience has shown that on the whole developers are not great at this. Where as when a task named ""Restore"" fails it's pretty obvious what went wrong here. 

> Yes, it was the case if you wanted a specific flavor. At least basic run with some defaults worked. I think it would still be useful to have cibuild.cmd that has a single parameter that identifies the CI leg (using the display name, ideally).

One tension point I found within our own infra is understanding where the responsibility lies to change defaults based on whether or not we are running in CI. The responsibility seems to be duplicated between cibuild.cmd, build.ps1 and arguably our YML in a few places. Feels like there should be one place that says ""okay I'm in CI mode, let me set the defaults for CI"".

"@github squash merge of this PR is fine. I definitely want to *merge* the PR going into VS though as those commits are carefully curated. 

I'd rather merge my PR into VS right away and have your insertion follow-up and succeed on its own. Since your insertion will appear to 'downgrade' the nuget packages that you optimize, the bot that resolves conflicts will pick the wrong one and I have to manually fix it. But if my PR goes in first (or your insertion PR targets my PR's source branch instead of main) I believe the right thing will happen.
My PR by itself doesn't trigger any RPS regressions, so loss of IBC data from the Unsafe assembly evidently isn't too significant. And since that IBC data will be back with your next insertion, it doesn't seem like they _have_ to go in together."
"### User Tests

User Tests show expected breaks for js-only projects. These breaks don't exist when not in strict mode, and are addressable via `/** @github */` jsDoc type assertions.

### DT Tests
There are some breaks in DT tests that may need to be addressed:
  - [ ] `electron-spellchecker` - `Error in electron-spellchecker\nOK` - Unsure what is wrong here as there is no output.
  - [ ] `electron-prompt` - `Error in electon-prompt\nOK`
  - [ ] `electron-window-state` - `Error in electon-window-state\nOK`
  - [ ] `electron-localshortcut` - `Error in electon-localshortcut\nOK`
  - [x] `memcached` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`. These may be due to incorrect calls to `resolve` in the tests and if so are the kind of error this PR is intended to catch.
  - [x] `system-task` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `async-stream-emitter` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `graphql-relay` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `node-wit` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `react-window-infinite-loader` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `stream-demux` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `undertaker` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `xml` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `listr` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `mirrorx` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `nightmare` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `polka` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `react-router-guard` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `redux-form/v4` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `redux-form/v5` - `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`
  - [x] `snapsvg` - `Argument of type (value: unknown) => void' is not assignable to a parameter of type '() => void'. Seems like the kind of error this PR is intended to produce.
  - [x] `react-virtualized` - `Type '(value: unknown) => void' is not assignable to type '() => void'`. Seems like the kind of error this PR is intended to produce.
  - [x] `fetch-mock` - Seems like the type specified to be assignable to `PromiseConstructor` is wrong and needs to be addressed in `fetch-mock`.
  - [x] `aframe` - `Property 'setHSL does not exist on type 'string | number | Color`. **Unrelated to this change**.

In general it seems the DT tests need to be updated, but that shouldn't be too difficult as correctly supplying an argument would be a backwards-compatible change.

### RWC Tests

Test failures in RWC seem to be expected and fall into the following categories:
- Untyped `Promise` usage in checked JS files in `--strict` mode.
- Untyped `Promise` usage in TS files when passing the `resolve` callback (whose type is `(value: unknown) => void`) to a function that expects `() => void`, which is the kind of error this PR is intended to produce.
- Expected changes to existing errors due to a change in the call signature for `resolve`.

### Summary

All errors in DT, User, and RWC tests are the expected outcome of this change. The DT tests mentioned above can be addressed by a backwards-compatible PR to DefinitelyTyped, which I can create prior to merging this PR.

Related PR: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/47216"
"If we're willing to give up the expressiveness of the runtime assertions in cases where we already report compile-time errors, then the two-helper emit can be even further reduced:

```js
var __classPrivateFieldSet = (this && this.__classPrivateFieldSet) || function (receiver, state, value, kind, f) {
    if (typeof state === ""function"" ? receiver !== state : !state.has(receiver)) throw new TypeError(""Private state access of wrong provenance"");
    if (kind === ""method"") throw new TypeError(""Attempted to set private method"");
    if (kind === ""accessor"") f.call(receiver, value);
    else if (typeof state === ""function"") f.value = value;
    else state.set(receiver, value);
    return value;
};
var __classPrivateFieldGet = (this && this.__classPrivateFieldGet) || function (receiver, state, kind, f) {
    if (typeof state === ""function"" ? receiver !== state : !state.has(receiver)) throw new TypeError(""Private state access of wrong provenance"");
    return kind === ""method"" ? f : kind === ""accessor"" ? f.call(receiver) : typeof state === ""function"" ? f.value : state.get(receiver);
};
```

The above still errors at runtime in the same places (since `f` would be `undefined`), even though the error would be more cryptic. We can even further reduce the size of the `__classPrivateFieldSet` if we don't mind emitting somewhat harder to read code:
```js
var __classPrivateFieldSet = (this && this.__classPrivateFieldSet) || function (receiver, state, value, kind, f) {
    if (typeof state === ""function"" ? receiver !== state : !state.has(receiver)) throw new TypeError(""Private state access of wrong provenance"");
    if (kind === ""method"") throw new TypeError(""Attempted to set private method"");
    return (kind === ""accessor"" ? f.call(receiver, value) : typeof state === ""function"" ? f.value = value : state.set(receiver, value)), value;
};

"Discussed in the call, but to put in writing—the reason `isNewIdentifierLocation` should be true in this case is because

```ts

at this point you very well may be writing a new property declaration or even binding pattern, which is exactly what `isNewIdentifierLocation` is for—_any_ time you could be writing a name not already in scope, that property must be set to `true` on any completion responses. It sounds like that flag is wrong in TS files too."

Based on a customer feedback received in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/45592#issuecomment-741994471 I decided to try to shrink `CacheEntry` a little bit more. I was able to reduce the managed memory needed for allocating a `CacheEntry` from 280 to 224 bytes (on x64).

Main changes:

- remove two enum fields (`2x sizeof(int)`), store the information in an union struct called `CacheEntryState`. It now consists of two bytes for the mentioned enums and one byte for all the boolean flags. There is one more that is still not used, so we can add more stuff in the future ;). This looks like a magic and @github is responsible for teaching me this kind of crazy stuff ;)
- move 3 lists related to tokens to a separate type called `CacheEntryTokens`. This allows us for saving space if they are not used (the most common scenario)
- remove the `_lock` field, use the field that stores `CacheEntryTokens` for locking instead (it guards the access to the tokens and the lock is needed only to work with the tokens)

The CPU time has not changed, but allocations did:

"> That is, we could compute in one of the following orders (assuming reordering was allowed):

@github Not quite... The imported canonical order for a dynamic block copy is `dst, size, src` (notice that it is wrong w. r. t. the original IL order). So we could have:
```
dst, size, src <-- unchanged
size, dst, src <-- gtEvalSizeFirst = true

src, size, dst <-- reversed ASG + gtEvalSizeFirst = true

(Inverse `DYN_BLK` density = number of method contexts / number of `DYN_BLK` nodes)
(Notably I measured this just before rationalization to not have noise from cases where we turn dynamic blocks into regular `BLK`s)

So it appears that indeed, we never set this value to `true`. Most likely because in the majority of cases the `size` is a simple local node - I would not expect complex expressions as inputs to what is essentially `memcpy` to appear often."
"Stream end is a http2 and http3 concept. I assume it has no impact on http11. Probably worth double checking with winhttp folks.

My experience is in the server side of http, but there we validate the content length and error if doesn’t match the actual content.

"My concern is that this might be a step in the opposite direction we're trying to go. We want it to be dead-simple to work on this repo, and to have obvious error messages when contributors do the wrong thing or are missing required tooling. I don't think we're there yet -- the current errors are useless --, but I prefer the build fail fast instead of failing later with mysterious test errors."
Nit: wrong class
I'll see why it's being confused since it looks rather wrong if there are extraneous files.
"We don't think we want to do this.

This I believe could result in the creation of multiple certificates if there is a persistent issue that is causing an exception here.

We'd rather see the tool fail in these cases and get a chance to understand what's going on wrong."
can you explain what was wrong with the old code?
"As this solves it in the wrong place, closing."
"> This PR is retaining the existing behavior, so there's no risk of anything breaking. The previous code was extremely confusing because it looked like we were requiring asynchronous continuations, but because we were using the wrong enum type, it actually had no effect at all (the TaskContinuationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously value was being passed as the state parameter, being boxed as an object!).

Ahhhh, we passed in the wrong options. The existing behavior is still questionable 😄 "
"Before the fix one test would pass, and another would fail. It also easy to get into a regression where either both start failing or only one. I had such cases due to mistakes while fixing the bug.
I figured, it is better to keep separate tests so that it would be easy to diagnose what went wrong.

am i wrong... or does every flow path call nextCommandHandler as the very last thing it does.  It feels like we coul dmake this much simpler by pulling out 'nextCommandHandler' to a parent entrypoint and calling into a helper function that never has to deal with it.

It does reduce risk _now_, but I'd then be worried if our public API was getting the same attention of the internal code. Or also if the compiler at one point would accidentally call the ISymbol implementation and get the ""wrong"" behavior."

dumb question.  why not just have the TypeItem do the same thing the extension method item does?  then you can operate on both consistently.
"@github I was thinking about this after our offline conversation. I don't think the metadata is wrong. The current limitations are largely an implementation detail and there is nothing wrong with the metadata since it is valid/parsable.

Up to you if you want to revert it."
"Alright I know I'm the one who did this wrong the first time, so I can't really fault you, but this actually needs to get captured like so:

> However I do not understand the logic you encoded there with regards to the offsetHeight and I also think that we now always set the multi-line class, even when not needed. Can we discuss this algorithm there?

Sure, my thinking was the following:

1. If `allTabsWidth` exceeds `visibleTabsContainerWidth`, then apply the `multi-line` class to wrap tabs if multi-line tabs have been enabled in settings
2. However, the flaw in the above is that once the tabs were wrapped,  `allTabsWidth` would once again be equal to `visibleTabsContainerWidth`, so the class would be immediately removed. So, if `allTabsWidth` and `visibleTabsContainerWidth` are equal, it also checks if `allTabsHeight` is equal to `EDITOR_TITLE_HEIGHT` (the default height). If it is, then the `multi-line` class is removed.

You mentioned that the class is set even when not needed, is there a specific example of this? If my logic is wrong somewhere I can attempt to revise it.

> For example we can simply use the DEFAULT_EDITOR_MIN_DIMENSIONS.height as a driver and disable multi-line tabs if the editor height gets below this value?

Can do, if possible could you give me a pointer for where to get the current editor height from? I can try to look for it/create a method for it myself if it doesn't already exist."

"Dumb idea, if text is both ""more bright"" and ""more faint"", would that mean that it negates itself and you just see text at normal brightness? In other words, would `IsBold() && IsFaint()` mean that we should just use the default font config?"

"That won't fix the bug because the call we want to avoid making if there's already a `ContentDialog` being shown is the `FindName` call.

Also, I like the logical separation between `ShowDialog` and `CanShowDialog`, instead of having `ShowDialog` do double duty of checking whether a dialog is currently open before showing it. It keeps the presenter as a sort of 'dumb' component and puts the onus on the caller."

"@github Sorry, I didn't add clarification for my question :).

In the current implementation, there are three steps to insert a new class declaration
1. copy comments., I think in this stage `copyLeadingComments` changes comment and adds `\r` 
2. delete node (with comments, for that reason need to copy comments before)
3. insert a new node

As I understood from the https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/23871 description, better to combine three steps into one to just replace a node with a function by class declaration. Maybe I'm wrong and need to do the following steps 

1. copy comment before (to change comment with a carriage return) and remove (to avoid comment duplication) previous original comment (I'm not sure, however, we can try to use `{ leadingTriviaOption: textChanges.LeadingTriviaOption.IncludeAll }` in `replaceNode`)
2. replace a node with function by a class declaration

Do `fourslash/server` tests require explicit changing comments to add carriage return symbols?

"I think it was because you were watching at wrong time.. Infact resolutionCache is suppose to handle the caching/updates so i think its worth the try for cleaner approach.

"this would normally be true but there are some cases where it's not:
- we cache not configure type info
- we try to get configured type info but error occurs (i.e. number handling is wrong) but after effective converter is computed

"What I mean is that in the following code

```
(namedImport.importClause?.namedBindings as NamedImports).elements

if the assertion is wrong, then this has the potential to crash before the call to `map`, because you'll end up running `undefined.elements`.

But it was already similarly the case for the old code:

```
(namedImport.importClause!.namedBindings as NamedImports).elements
```

where you'd end up running `undefined.namedBindings`.

So I guess I don't understand the need to switch to a `?.`.

Maybe it's unclear, but [a parenthesized type assertion *does* break the optional chain](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/DYUwLgBAHhC8EAoCGB+AdAIwkgztgdgJ4CUaAxkA)."

"@github could you take a look at these changes?

The gist of this change is
* Don't lock on the input string
* Swap locks for Interlocked operations
* Add some validation to prevent custom parsers from corrupting Uri instances
* Remove a (very hard to hit) race condition where `Uri.Equals` could return the wrong result
* Reduce race conditions around `MoreInfo` accesses, that would result in throwing away a value instead of caching it (not dangerous, just potentially duplicated work)"

2. It's checking the _current_ thread's OS id against `getpid()`.  Which is wrong. We need to map `MonoNativeThreadId` (`pthread_t`) to `pid_t`.  That won't be an easy fix.  Going to revert my change.

@github I'm going to revert my change, open a new GH Issue for Mono runtime, and then disable the test for Mono"
"@github I think you're right about the return code. That makes this PR wrong, so don't merge :-)

I've been hunting through the glibc source to see what happens, and when. I think I found the right code at https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/createthread.c;hb=HEAD#l122 which indicates that if the `attr` parameter to `create_thread` has a flag defined to set the affinity then it will fail and kill the thread if it receives an `EPERM` from the syscall. I'll cycle back tomorrow to see if I can work out whether the .NET PAL is explicitly setting the affinity flags causing glibc to attempt to use the syscall.

@github might have more input about glibc's behaviour."

That case works on tests, with a signature completion showing up for `M` that has an associated action for importing `Foo`, but it doesn't work on vscode (the editor doesn't show it). I'm going to try and find out why.
Edit: it is showing up, it was just showing up as the very last item in the completion list (even after snippets). Once I picked it, it started showing up on the top again, right below the normal entry for `M`. My conclusion is that the vscode ordering of entries is a mystery 🤷‍♀️

That also made me realize that, if `Foo` is not exported, the signature we offer for `M` is going to reference type `Foo` anyways, and that's an error. I think that's ok though, since the user could either change `Foo` to be exported, or realize they can't write a signature for `M`, but I might be wrong.

Simple example where this kicks in:
```C#
    public static int F(int x)
    {
        int r = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++)
        {
            if (x != 0) continue;
            r++;
            if (x != 0) continue;
            r++;
        }
        
        return r;
    }
```
Here the jit was unable to prove the second `x != 0` was redundant. The flow in this case looks like

[edit: had the wrong graph here initially]

While trying to prove that the branch at D would make the branch at S1 redundant, the jit was considering the path S2 -> D -> S1, and so decided both S1 and S2 could reach S1, and hence the value of `x != 0` at S1 was not known.

The fix is to designate D as an excluded block, so that the jit only considers paths that do not pass through D.

A moderate number of diffs, largely improvements. The largest improvements are cases where blocks with some substantial computation (newarr) are now unreachable. 

The two largest regressions (see libraries pmi) are case where the RA creates large numbers of compensation blocks.

This is because we include the Unix/OpenSSL version of Interop.CryptoNative.cs which has the wrong library name.

I think we should rename the `CryptoNative` field to `AndroidCryptoNative` for all the DllImports to `AndroidCryptoNative_` functions to make these mistakes easier to catch."
"Hmm for some reason it thinks you're not a contributor: `Error: @github is not a repo collaborator, backporting is not allowed.` which is weird, probably something wrong with the token being used for the GitHub API."
"The overall logic LGTM.

I left a couple nits/comments about adding comments and possibly minor refactorings to help with readability when this inevitably is looked at again in the future. I likewise called out a peculiar scenario around handling fractional digits which I don't believe is possible (happy to be proven wrong here).

It would be great if this could get a second pair of eyes on it (CC. @github, @github, @github since you've reviewed or worked on BigInteger semi-recently)."

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/57702

The casing of the SDK imported via the Sdk attribute was wrong which lead to:

`Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms.csproj : error MSB4236: The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.SDK' specified could not be found.`

We should probably backport this into release/6.0-rc1.

PropertiesBinaryReader could be access by more than one thread which was causing starting reading from the wrong position and skip positions.
Added a test case for it.

"> What we are observing here is a limitation that exists in the product and should be fixed there. MSBuild/NuGet doesn't support checking compatibility between platforms yet. Example: $([MSBuild]::TargetPlatformCompatible('$(TargetFramework)', 'unix'))

Agreed. But until we get that functionality in the product, there's nothing wrong with us having some ""helper"" functions to make our code clean/readable."
"Since the advent of NRT, It's been like a green light to use *more* nulls. C# devs seem particularly averse to `Maybe` or `Option`.  Maybe (ahem), if these were added *to the language*, they'd get better adoption and then we wouldn't need so much extra syntax.

I also have another comment re. the actual exception type: in a library, like .NET itself, the exception is as meaningul as it can be. However, in client apps and libraries, where things are much more specific, then `ArgumentNullException` doesn't really convey anything meaninful. For instance, a better exception when processing `Customers` and encountering a null `Customer`, would be a `CustomerProcessingFailedException`.
Over the years, I've had devs quote guidance from 'Framework Design Guidelines' (which is a superb book, don't get me wrong), which makes little sense in non generic Frameworks."
"Yeah, the value it's set to be the ""DPI"" settings from the given platform (Usually from an API called ""DPI""). For example, when Android returns its native rects, it doesn't return the values with the given device DPI, so the math is wrong until it is added. "
Totally... Something went wrong here. I am sure at some point it was correct. Thanks for catching this!
"@github @github - this is wrong and I think will break the templates. Any idea how we can prevent the bot from ""fixing"" this?"
"We weren't doing that because there's no user code that runs inside this try/catch block 😆  

After the comment at L104, it was expected that everything would succeed unless something is seriously wrong.

It was intentional before your changes, and based on my other feedback, I'm not sure it needs to change."
What's wrong with using [Span's void* ctor?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1.-ctor?view=netcore-3.0#System_Span_1__ctor_System_Void__System_Int32_)
"In the API review meeting I believe Ryan claimed we were keeping the same order that the serializer accepted the arguments. Looks like the order was wrong, so we should probably change it 👍 "
"```suggestion
We may not investigate issues which haven't received many votes/comments and choose to close these. The reason is that the impact is very scoped and potentially something is wrong in the user code. Consider asking these questions on StackOverflow.

"Frankly, this feels like the wrong approach.  That you're getting an error here means the returned `DateTime`s aren't `DateTimeKind.Utc`, which seems... not correct for their intended use.  There's no reason for them to be anything other than `Utc`, and the fact that the ""safe"" method doesn't otherwise correct the issue means it's going to cause problems further down the line.  If you echo/pass on the claims, is this currently causing these timestamps to change due to local/utc confusion?

The JWT claims are effectively ignorant of timezone, but are still absolute timestamps, and so can be considered UTC - a far better approach would be ensuring that the parsing method ensures that it returns the `DateTime` with the proper kind, and ensure that anything that could modify has the output coerced to UTC (via `SpecifyKind(DateTimeKind.Utc)` - which is just going to ""assign"" the kind, and leave the timestamp otherwise unchanged, and won't throw).

1. we are just avoiding certain initialization. literally a guarding `if` condition. 
2. Sometimes we add that feature in FeatureCollection. 
3. uses null coalescing `?.methodCall()` or `!.methodCall()` and forget. 
4.

We could perhaps support the common subset by ignoring the FD spec's back-compat parse (`file://usr/local/bin` =>`/usr/local/bin`), and ignoring the Windows remote-host parse (`file://server/share/file` => `\\server\share\file`), and hence having unambiguous parsing for those URLs we don't reject as ""wrong host"" (FD) or ""remote host"" (Windows), although that does block using OSC 7 when my shell's CWD _is_ a remote (UNC) path, which includes WSL mounts accessed from the host.

Whichever format you choose, I can't see a way to avoid making some or all shells aware that they're on Windows, without already-rejected hacking at process information to determine details about the virtualised filesystem they are reporting paths against.

however that's also not correct 'cause some heaps are already using their mark_list_index so it'd be wrong to change it. but now I've thought about it a bit more I think we could make this better by allocating the memory for the new mark_list_piece*, if needed, before sort_mark_list. so for regions we'd have something like grow_mark_list_pieces before the `gc_join_null_dead_long_weak` join. and in the join we fake a global mark list overflow if any heap failed to alloc memory for their mark_list_piece*. this way we don't need to call sort_mark_list at all on any heap if we already don't have memory for the pieces (so we save the sort - of course you can achieve that part by simply moving the alloc code toward the top in sort_mark_list for that heap; but this way we save it for all heaps). what do you think? am I missing anything?

"> Don't you need similar change in markExportAsReferenced ?

Actually, I don't need to call `markExportAsReferenced` anymore. The `markAliasReferenced` is more correct for an export assignment (as it mimics what `checkIdentifier` would do). `markExportAsReferenced` looks at the wrong symbol for an export assignment (it looks at the `default` export symbol rather than the symbol of the identifier in the expression), so it hasn't been doing any meaningful work anyway. I'll remove its handling of them. (And you know what? The checking functions built into `markAliasSymbolAsReferenced` are strange - I'll try to move those so they're local to what they check, too)

> Also I think we should remove the isConstEnumOrConstEnumOnlyModule check or update it before calling markAliasSymbolAsReferenced in checkJsxOpeningLikeElementOrOpeningFragment,

I don't know why we check const-ness here, actually. I'm pretty sure we just need to always consider it referenced, const or no (since we need to preserve the import because we'll be referencing it for the factory function in the emit).

> checkPropertyAccessExpressionOrQualifiedName

I don't think so - the check there is just checking `prop` to see if it's even possible for `parentSymbol` to be const - a fast path. It calls into `markAliasReferenced` which does the full check.

> markEntityNameOrEntityExpressionAsReference

No need - this is only used for decorator metadata, which I think we'd rather have been the same for preserve const enums/non preserved (and const enums are just going to be mapped to `Number` and their namespaces `Object` anyway - unlike other types which may have necessitated keeping imports for classes of some sort; so we don't want their imports kept in preserve mode, since we won't use them!)."

We have no reason to do the return type special-casing below if the return _isn't_ context sensitive (it's extra work we shouldn't do since it'll be repeated in later inference phases), so we should still be checking that the return expression is context sensitive, even if we pile on additional constraints."

I'm pretty sure this will not be affected, since this PR is not doing `commonJS` => `ESM`, it's doing `TS namespaces` => `ESM`. There will likely still be a build step that bundles Typescript so that it works with Node as it did before.

> I hope I miss some obvious measurable upsides?

If following coding standards by making real modules (and not using `namespace`s) is not enough, using modules will unlock the possibility to do more optimized builds due to treeshaking that I don't think was possible with the old approach. For example #27891 regarding the growing size of the Typescript project.

There are likely more benefits than the above, but one should not dismiss the benefit of code that is easier to learn and maintain. Future contributors will likely have an easier time to learn the code base after this change than before.

"Thanks for starting the discussion about the design goals here! It's helpful to see a sketch implementation without getting too bogged down in tests.

I notice that quite a bit of the complexity here (and I'm not saying it's crazy complex) comes from tracking the disposals in groups so we can report their aggregate results. Let's consider whether we could drop some of that and make things simpler for ourselves, which might also make things easier to understand for customers.

Specifically, what if we treat each async disposal as a completely independent background task? If any of them fail individually then we report it (immediately, not waiting for the rest of its friends), but otherwise nothing else happens. Then we don't have to deal with any of the aggregate reporting.

I think this might be easier for customers to understand because if you have a lot of async disposal, some members of the group might take ages to complete, or might not even ever complete. Then if you're waiting for the whole group, you'd never see the failure statuses of the ones that did fail sooner.

It does make sense for prerendering (only) to be waiting for all its associated async disposals to complete before we issue the response, because we do want to fail the response if any of the async disposals fail. However we could do that using the existing `_render.AddToPendingTasks` facility that @github implemented long ago."

"@github that would be the wrong thing to do because as I sad a missing parameter list is not equivalent to an empty one there. The delegate method may have a lot of parameters after all, so I have to check if this returns null and in that case forget about this and synthesize parameters from the delegate method instead.

this is OK:
```c#
Action<string> a = delegate {};
```
this is not:
```c#
Action<string> a = delegate() {};
```
In the first case, I create a parameter with arg1, in the second one I create an empty parameter list - yes the code will be broken but it's already broken now.

With simple lambdas it's ok to make a parameter list because there's no difference between a simple lambda and a parenthesized one with the same argument."

Don't get me wrong though, having a standardised API for this is not a bad thing, and sets us up for the future possibility of improving the feature, not to mention that doc hover and a context menu would be a step forward as well. I do realise that there may be architectural changes required in order to support ""virtual"" characters for the inline hints, and that it's probably the reason the feature has been sitting in the backlog for all this time.

"`I` was very wrong. `any` is at least the type of `p2`, which is bound to the same symbol as that property because the object literal at this location isn't being correctly interpreted as a binding pattern in all locations. This PR is like a partial fix for that (now the type isn't completely incorrect, at least), but the symbols still need to be bound up correctly. IMO, the root cause is object literal/binding pattern confusion causing us to not handle binding patterns correctly in all the places we need to.

"Hey @github - thank you so much for the feedback and suggestions! 😊

Yup, basically ended up applying both those suggestions, I've documented everything in the new PR.

Just for sake of clarify, the `DictionarySlim` we use is not directly from the `Microsoft.Experimental.Collections` package, but it's a custom type that used the source of that as a base, which I've then customized and optimized specifically for our needs in the messenger types in the MVVM Toolkit. Of course, your point is still perfectly valid and a bug might very well slip into the codebase in that area at some point, so this PR should made the whole thing much more resilient and easier to debug 😄

As a final note, to get back to @github's original point, I was wondering if the expected adoption of the MVVM Toolkit would be enough to have this PR (I mean this one for .NET 5) meet the requirements for the .NET 5 release? Otherwise as Stephen said, I can just sprinkle a bunch of `!` operators where needed, so it wouldn't be a breaking change, sure."

When performing value numbering of the initial memory state for loop entries, we treat single-entry loops specially. First, we walk the loop to determine it contains non-analyzable (from VN's point of view, i. e. not stores to fields or arrays) memory-related side effects (""havoc""). While doing so, we collect the handles of fields and types of arrays, later to be used as primary selectors in VN, of modified fields. If the loop is determined to not have ""havoc"", we compute the initial memory VN (which would ordinarily consist of a `PHI` with one unknown input) as follows: take the outgoing VN of the non-loop predecessor, and reset all the maps corresponding to primary selectors that we know will be stored to in the loop from the previous walk to ""new, unique"" values.

This then allows us to find the values for locations that were not modified in the loop when walking the `MapStore` chains while numbering nodes in the loop.

This is all rather nice, but has one flaw: the VNs given to primary maps (corresponding to the values obtained via indexing into the heap with a primary selector) all have `TYP_REF` types, which is strictly not ""right"" for at least static fields, and for others, confuses the code that numbers stores to indirections.

Consider the following C# snippet:
```cs
private static void Problem(ClassWithFields a)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        a.Field++;

        if (a.Field == 1)
        {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

We had the following numbering for the interesting trees:

As can be seen, there is a cast inserted when `VNApplySelectorsAssign` performs the map updates for the store, it is coming from here:

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/972891ff4682968e6d693c4b618408a55befe0b1/src/coreclr/jit/valuenum.cpp#L8325-L8330

Here `newFldMapVN` will have `TYP_REF`, `indType` - `TYP_INT`, causing the mismatch, because the code just above uses `TypeOfVN(fldMapVN)`:

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/972891ff4682968e6d693c4b618408a55befe0b1/src/coreclr/jit/valuenum.cpp#L8301-L8303

The cast is inserted at an unfortunate point: above the primary selector map (in this case, the field map), breaking the `MapStore` chain and causing subsequent load to not find the value from the store. Giving proper types to the primary selector maps helps avoid that.

Now, a keen reader will notice that the code above is actually just wrong, as it will constantly insert casts in cases when the first fields is actually of a `struct` type, and where no casts are needed at all, as they, if required, would have been inserted in the `VNApplySelectorsAssign` call that ""gets rid of the remaining struct references"". So the question is: why am I not fixing this code, and instead fixing some other code that just happens to trigger this bug in another way?

The answer is that I think it is beneficial to the model to have it be typed consistently, which is both more understandable and more efficient (by avoiding allocating unnecessary VNs). Changes to VN are somewhat high in risk, so I will be making them very incrementally, and in small chunks. Ideally, most of them should be zero-diff ones. This one is not, so I am making it separately.

Question: with this change, more VM will be made, is that a concern? Answer: the method in question is rather cold (not discernible on a profile taken from replaying `libraries.pmi`), the new VM calls should be of the quick variety, and additionally, there are many, many more similar VM calls made inside `VNApplySelectors/Assign`, their cost will dwarf anything added here (I actually have an experiment that caches some of the info on the `FldSeq` nodes, it shows `0.1%` PIN improvements under SPMI, but it is probably not worth it in the VM scenario as it also increases the memory consumption by about the same margin).

Diffs: [`win-x64`](pending).

> What does ""registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_arm64]"" mean

On each platform we have a different way to ""Register"" a global install of .NET. On Windows it's in the registry, on Linux and macOS it's in a config file in the `/etc/dotnet` location. Since these registrations are potentially architecture specific it's a good piece of information to diagnose issues with finding runtimes (for example if the registration is wrong).

You can read more about this here: https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2020/install-locations.md
and (architecture specific) here: https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2021/install-location-per-architecture.md"

"Possible yes, but it would require doing crazy things. Both the managed and native dlls are in the same package, so you can't reference different versions if you tried. It would require you copy a different inprocess native dll to the published/build directory. In that case, this would throw. Trying to cover this case is pointless. 

The only thing I do want to protect against is making sure we are actually running inprocess in the startup hook."
Wrong comment?
VS being VS. Shine on you crazy diamond!
"@github right, you can build stuff as portable and still create a ""manifest"" to ensure that the distro specific package references the right dependencies to install. 
I have thought that the packaging tools somehow extract the list of dependencies from the compiled binaries automatically when creating the package, but I guess I was wrong. If the dependency list is always prepared manually by the package maintainer, then there is no difference between the portable and non-portable build. Except for the dynamic search for the libSSL.
@github could you please share what are the reasons for using non-portable builds for the packages you build? Maybe we are missing some important aspect here."

"Does this new task support the user overriding the values in the manifest? I think that is more the issue here. If the tool overwrites the file, then if it makes a mistake or the user wants something different they can't do that.

For example, if some designer comes and gives the dev a set of files to copy directly into the platform folder and the dev adds some more icons - effectively adding 2 icons into the app: 1 from the designer and 1 from MauiIcon. Is there a way for the dev to prefer the specific icon and overwrite all the values?

For the other platforms, if there is no icon set in the manifest, then the tool provides one. If there is an icon, then the tool does nothing. This allows for the tool to only do work if the dev has not explicitly told it not to. The dev should always have the last say - even if they are wrong. :)

It may just be the case that the new template manifest has nothing in it so the tool always generates the file. "

"Since there doesn't seem to be a good way to detect when a component was prerendered (AFAIK) and avoid invoking this JS method altogether, I've instead taken an approach in which `<title>` elements rendered from Blazor components are not removed after the initial render. I will concede this is a bit of a hack and only works because we know that `<title>` will be the first and only element rendered by `<PageTitle>` components. I also considered adding a special attribute to `<title>` elements rendered from Blazor components, but thought it might not be best to clutter things that way.

I'm open to other suggestions for approaches to this. If we were able to detect prerendering in `BuildRenderTree()` (or, rather, detect when we weren't prerendering), we could simply not render any `<title>` in `HeadSection` at first, then remove all `<title>` elements in `OnAfterRenderAsync()` without needing to check if they are rendered from Blazor components, then re-render with the new `<title>`. This would be a much better way of doing things IMO, but there just doesn't seem to be a good way to check if we're prerendering on the first render pass. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong about that. 😃 "

"> I've also implemented a check to see if the calculated item size is within some margin of the user-provided item size

This seems a bit quirky. Maybe it is the right design, but I'd be interested to discuss it. What I'm concerned about is that commonly, developers *think* they know what the item size is, but they are wrong by a small margin of error, perhaps because of the element `margin` being added onto its `height`. My hope had been that we can calculate the actual height and thereby free developers from the consequences of being slightly wrong, whereas the rule in this PR means we couldn't help them in this way.

I understand it's hard to determine the exact height but I'm unsure how bad are the consequences of us getting it wrong by a < 1px fraction or if there are any other approaches you've considered. Let's discuss when possible!"
"@github correct me if I'm wrong, but we are not supporting operators right now, as the emitted IL will differ based on the underlying type of the IL. So operators cannot be applied to generic types still.

"I did this for backward compatibility. The issue is that when the KeepAliveInterval is validated in WebSocketCreationOptions, when invalid an ArgumentOutOfRangeException for paramName ""KeepAliveInterval"" (PascalCase), but the existing code was throwing ArgumentOutOfRangeException with paramName ""keepAliveInterval"" (camelCase). There was even a test for that. It felt wrong for me to change the test to check for PascalCase for the name or even more wrong to throw camelCase when validating the property.

If you consider that the CreateFromStream would throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException with different casing than the actual name of the argument OK and not a breaking change, I will remove it and validate it only once in the property setter."

"Thanks @github!

This works and I can communicate with the server with a wrong host certificate. However, it is not ideal since I need to use a platform-specific API (Android) in order to extend HostnameVerifier and establish communication.

Ideally, since my app targets multi-platforms, a universal solution for my http client library targeting a single framework would be the best (my http client communication library is universal and consumed by all of my platforms), which was how it worked before in the Android platform (when using mono android 8.1 framework) by simply extending the ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback.

This is, although a bit cumbersome (since my client library needs to target android specifically for this workaround), an acceptable workaround for my case, however.

Thank again!"
"I'm not sure what this is doing.

1. Is it adding the runtime config template from the functional test to every testsuite?  That seems wrong.
2. Why is it using the `.template.json` file from the source directory?  it should be using the generated `runtimeconfig.json` from the output directory (ie from ""bin/Debug/.../runtimeconfig.json"") or maybe from the publish directory (I'm not sure) - there is probably some property that is set to the path to that file.  I'm not sure.
3. It probably doesn't need to be part of the `BundleTestAndroidApp` target.  It can be its own target that the `PublishTestAsSelfContained` task can depend on.
4. I don't like the ""output.pefile"" filename.  (a) it's not a PE file anymore, (b) ""output"" doesn't really mean anything.  How about ""runtimeconfig.bin"" or something?

"Either this comment is wrong, or your removal of the `Where` is wrong, but I have no idea which"
"I believe the original comment is wrong, but also confusing.

In particular, we expose `Vector128<float> Fma.MultiplyAdd(Vector128<float> a, Vector128<float> b, Vector128<float> c)`, this is logically `r = (a * b) + c`.

All three instructions are of the form `VFMADD***PS xmm1, xmm2, xmm3/m128` differing on which argument is treated as `a`, `b`, or `c`.

As such:
* `132`: `xmm1 = (xmm1 * xmm3/m128) + xmm2`
* `213`: `xmm1 = (xmm1 * xmm2) + xmm3/m128`
* `231`: `xmm1 = (xmm2 * xmm3/m128) + xmm1`

This path was originally `op1->isContained` meaning, `op1` is the ""memory"" operand and should (to avoid an additional `movaps reg, [addr]`) take the position of `xmm3/m128`.

Since `op1` is part of the multiplication and should take the spot of `xmm3/m128`, we can therefore pick `132` or `231` as the correct form. Which we pick should depend on if the storage location was `op2` or `op3`"

"I played around with it a bit more. Breaking out the `AssignmentDeclarationKind.Prototype` case and adding the `ObjectLiteralExpression` properties to that node seems to do the trick. Don't need the `prototypeAccess` either since we should be in one...

    const binaryExpression = (node as BinaryExpression);
    const assignmentTarget = binaryExpression.left as PropertyAccessExpression;

    // If we see a prototype assignment, start tracking the target as a class
    if (isIdentifier(assignmentTarget.expression)) {
        addTrackedEs5Class(assignmentTarget.expression.text);

            forEachChild(binaryExpression.right, addChildrenRecursively);
        endNode();

"Let's make sure we're on the same page:

**Are you saying `spellingSuggestionGlobal1.ts` (as written, with `const x`) should produce the error message `Cannot find name 'global'. Did you mean 'globalThis'?`?**

If so, I disagree. Users will follow that suggestion and change `global.x` to `globalThis.x`, then get another error (`Property 'x' does not exist on type 'typeof globalThis'.`), then be confused/frustrated and have to research why it doesn't work, then probably end up ignoring the suggestion anyway and write `x` instead of `globalThis.x`.

**Or are you saying that in situations where `x` is a known property of `globalThis` and the user writes `global.x` that it would be nice to say `Cannot find name 'global'. Did you mean 'globalThis'?`?**

If so, I agree, but unfortunately that would be tricky to implement (unless I'm missing something). I'd bet that this situation occurs rarely in the wild, so it might not be worth the complexity cost to maintain a dedicated suggestion for it. I could be wrong, though.

In any case it seems orthogonal to the bugfix in this pull request. Currently [if you write something like `global.Math` the error message won't suggest `globalThis`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/OYGw9gRghiB0CyUAuALIA), either.

"> Suppressions are a hack for hacking your way out of issues a cast won't fix (like weird inheritance issues). But a cast will fix almost any issue (even those issues if you're creative with where you cast and to what) - every example you have here can be fixed with a single `any` cast (on the receiver, library itself, or argument), which is much better handled in the language. In other cases, where you have a massive chunk of unchecked code, the per-file directive is fine. If a third party lib has the wrong type, you cast to the correct type or `any`, up to you, a suppression is completely incorrect and the wrong solution to the problem.
> 
> Honestly, we thought suppressions were a bad idea to begin with and I had to argue they had uses when migrating JS projects to TS (essentially as automatable TODOs since per issue suppressions are easy to place automatically). But some people turn to them rather than the much simpler cast, and seeing the arguments here just reinforces that - suppressions aren't ""better"" than a cast - they're much much worse, and they leave the compiler in a silent error state where things may not behave as expected. They are an absolute last resort, and _honestly_ the presence of a suppression should itself be an error, to indicate that the project has unchecked code that may have unintended cascading effects on downstream code (like quietly leaking an `any` that isn't caught by `noImplicitAny`).
> 
> If anyone is left thinking a suppression like this is their only possible solution, then we've failed in our documentation somewhere - even in JS we support jsdoc casts now, so you can cast out of almost any issues in JS, too. (Even missing imports can be fixed with `declare module` declarations)

Then why do we have `@github`? The same case goes, there's already a few use cases over in the issue linked in the OP. I understand the point that we want everything to be strict and casted correctly, however if we have options such as ts-ignore already, aren't we are already doing that suppression option anyway? what harm does this really have at the end of the day? If people are adding `@github` already, surely we want to enhance the developers experience?

I do agree suppressions are bad and we shouldn't supress before casts. However.. there's a use case for developers during debugging, migration etc."

Backport of #46151 to release/5.0

Fixes: #45651

## Customer Impact

On Unix, when using blocking overloads of `Socket.ReceiveFrom` after an asynchronous call to the same socket, the call may return wrong `remoteEP`.

## Regression?

Yes. The behavior is correct on 3.1.

## Testing

Extended `SocketTestHelper` so existing tests can validate the sync-over-async path of the blocking `ReceiveFrom`. Unfortunately, those tests are disabled on the 5.0 branch, so I had to port a minimal subset of #44591 (fix enabling the tests) so we can run them on CI for 5.0.

## Risk

Low. The bug was a small overlook, the fix is trivial, that impacts only the affected sync-over-async `ReceiveFrom` path.

"@github on further inspection, this seems like a one-off but was these DNS failures to talk to AzDO were the first two things this VM did after startup.  Given it successfully had to talk to and resolve DNS for Azure Storage, Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hub, and Microsoft Container registry in this time, and that we've had stuff in place to make sure the Helix daemon doesn't start before the network services I think it can be chalked up to a temporary network problem on this VM.

(not sure it's correct, running locally, the CI job might picked up a wrong baseline)

From a local run I see a lot of size regressions due to inlining (along with improvements). Now, when the inliner sees a GT_CNS_STR it considers it as a constant argument so all operations on this argument in callees are considered foldable including branches leading to bigger ""benefit multipliers"". Example: https://www.diffchecker.com/mLb1tijN (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/57bfe474518ab5b7cfe6bf7424a79ce3af9d6657/src/libraries/System.Private.Xml/src/System/Xml/Serialization/SoapAttributeOverrides.cs#L41)

Unfortunately, there is a faulty (too optimistic) heuristic ""if I see an unknown call and we have a const argument on stack - the call most likely returns another const"" - I am going to remove it, it's responsible for huge diffs in general.

I bet there will be some crazy corner case/thing and it won't work ... but I definitely hope it's not the case.
"> Seems like we use the ""enumerate early args then late args"" pattern quite often, I wonder if some sort of combined iterator makes sense.

I think for the most part these cases are ""visit all operands of `GenTreeCall` nodes"" and we should probably look into making them use either `GenTree::UseEdges`, `GenTree::Operands` or `GenTreeVisitor`. Also if the ordering is not important we can just use `Args()` and access both `GetEarlyNode()` and `GetLateNode()` in the loop body. However, I think this is a cleanup for another PR.

> Also wonder if we can come up with some kind of safeguards to make it harder to look at the wrong enumerations. Or maybe find better descriptive names?

I agree, it would be nice to find a better name for `LateArgs` that makes it clear that this is a subset of `Args` and that it may not be in arg order. `ArgsNeedingLatePlacement` could be one, although a bit verbose...
I do think with this PR the situation is significantly better than before. Iterating `Args()` and using `GetNode()` is in almost all scenarios the thing you want (it will never give you a placeholder/setup node). Contrast that with before, where iterating `gtCallArgs` and using `GetNode()` would give you setup nodes/placeholder after morph.

Note that many places in this PR are using `GetEarlyNode()` before morph which is always the same node as `GetNode()`. New code should probably just use `GetNode()` here, but when I mass-converted the uses I attempted to make sure the semantics were the same as previously. Perhaps something I might look at simplifying in a future PR."

We use this `additionalDeclarations.Add` mechanism in the source generator when we can't declare the local exactly where it's needed due to branching structure and the compiler not always being able to see that the local is definitely assigned.  In such cases, we instead emit the local at the beginning of the method, default initialized, and then later assign it where we need to.  In this particular case, we should be default assigning it but are accidentally calling base.Crawlpos().  This isn't functionally wrong, but it's unnecessary.

Introduced changes are fixing the problem of wrong stack size calculation for control flows with back edges.

This has been achieved by modifying the code generation loop in `generate_code` function to:

- Skip blocks which have uninitialised stack sizes 
- Mark emitted blocks
- When the loop finishes if the code generation is not complete (there were some skipped blocks), the code generation loop is repeated
- Following passes only handle blocks skipped in previous ones (already emitted blocks are not taken into account)

This change may impact performance.

Fixes #68757.

Probably good to just merge these methods like iOS since it always calls UpdateRotation - and I think that name is a bit wrong.

"~HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions should be as fully populated from config ass possible before calling ApplyHttpsDefaults which calls into user code with the options object.~


~I'd remove the two if blocks that were added to this method and add the following right before ApplyHttpsDefaults.~

```C#
// This was wrong: httpsOptions.SslProtocols = endpoint.SslProtocols ?? ConfigurationReader.EndpointDefaults.SslProtocols ?? SslProtocols.None;
```

Edit:

Instead, I would add the following right before ApplyHttpsDefaults:

```C#
httpsOptions.SslProtocols = ConfigurationReader.EndpointDefaults.SslProtocols ?? SslProtocols.None;
```


Then, right here, after ApplyHttpsDefault, I would add the following:

```C#
if (endpoint.SslProtocols.HasValue)
{
    httpsOptions.SslProtocols = endpoint.SslProtocols;
}

It's important that this second part happens before finding `matchingBoundEndpoints` or calling the `configureEndpoint` callbacks for named endpoints."

"> Does adding a Volatile.Read in IsNextOperationSynchronous_Speculative have an effect on performance? It would make more clear at what point we're picking a value that got set on another thread.

It wouldn't have any effect on x64, would have to check on arm64. On arm64 I think the memory barrier would usually be redundant (and in the wrong place, after the read instead of before), and the overhead would be incurred for each event and each queue.

"I rolled through this a few times. `fallbackSourceFileEncoding` is something that's informed by a compilation. Specifically, if we store on `EmitOptions` that means that the act of doing a compilation changes the `EmitOptions` that were passed into the compilation, which seemed to be wrong. Is there a way `fallbackSourceFileEncoding` makes sense to pass in for something that wouldn't be determined by a compilation? "
"My concern is this scenario:

1. Project A depends on a Metadata.dll that _doesn't_ have any IVT attributes in it.
2. Project B also depends on a different Metadata.dll, but it does use internals via IVT from it's Metadata.dll.
3. Some search happens on a public type in Metadata.dll, and the analysis is done with the IAssemblySymbol that is seen through A; the cache is populated that Metadata.dll is consumed from A and B, but because we're using the IAssemblySymbol of the Metadata.dll as seen through A, neither are marked with ""has internal access"".
4. A search happens in B's code on an internal type obtained from Metadata.dll through the IVT B sees. Because it's internal, we fetch the entry from step 3, and filter it to only things with internal access, which is nothing. B's code is never searched, so the identifier you invoked find reference on might not be found!

I see a few approaches for this:

1. Delete the cache. Problem solved; I think you said privately you are already doing that, so maybe that's the easiest answer.
2. [If we have to restore the cache...] Don't care. I'm hesitant to say this only because I don't know how widespread this is, I do know how difficult it will be to figure out a customer report if it does happen. I'm also wondering if Roslyn could hit this itself: our CodeStyle layer builds against NuGet packages that are older: would we end up building the IVT list based upon the IVTs in the NuGet package we build against, a newer IVT added in the source might potentially get skipped...? Consider my scenario above, where Project A is our Code Style layer and B is some code that has IVT into our Workspaces layer. Minimally, if we choose to not care, a comment at least recognizing the cache issue might be wise so that way if somebody else is debugging and thinks the cache is wrong, they know they're not crazy.
3. [If we can't delete the cache and find we must care...] Fix it. We already have to walk through all projects and all IAssemblySymbols to actually see which projects are referencing the assembly name in question; at that point we've collected all the IAssemblySymbols that might have an IVT we need to consider -- if we union all of the IVTs together of all the those assembly symbols, then the cache is safe. Assuming you don't process the same IAssemblySymbol more than once, this shouldn't really be any slower than what we have now. I'm guessing multitargeting might mean each IAssemblySymbol might be different, but it's easy to ask if two come from the same PE file path on disk, which would be sufficient for our needs here."
"I .. honestly don't know why I didn't choose that. It seems wrong for WindowsTerminal.exe to be depending on an interface from all the way down in TerminalControl; it's an app concern, and Control just happens to share the same concern."
"There likely should be an output from the task that includes the written generated files into FileWrites, so later builds delete the previously outputted files and a MSBuild clean would actually delete them.

"@github 

> No, but the spec recommends to wait for a client to cancel since a server can not decide whether the result is useful for the client or not.

Just as it is important for clients to be robust to naive servers (and LSP accommodates this), servers need to deal with imperfect clients.

The ability to reject requests with ContentModified is important to prevent an ever-growing backlog of file versions that need to be parsed. In particular we have seen clients in the wild that can send implicit requests after each keystroke and never cancel them. This causes a backlog when reparses are slower than the edit frequency.

Of course it's sufficient for either the client or the server to be smart, but absent some capability advertised by the client, servers must assume clients are dumb (and vice versa)."

"Even with the fix, the `_glyphIndices` for simple runs will have *wrong start* index, if there's N-M runs previous to them. For example a simple line like this:

```text
😀
```

There's two runs. First is complex, the second is simple. 

| Text | Length | Glyph Count |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 😀| 2 | 1 |
| (A lot of spaces | 118 | 118 |

The correct `_glyphIndices` is this:

| Index | Value |
| -- | -- |
| 0  | 11685 |
| 1  | 3 |
| 2  | 3 |
| 3 | 3 | 
| ... | ... |

But here we have:

| Index | Value |
| -- | -- |
| 0  | 11685 |
| 1  | **0** |
| 2  | 3 |
| 3 | 3 | 
| ... | ... |

Notice there's an incorrect 0 indice here, because when we do `GetTextComplexity` on the second run, we have no idea how many glyphs the previous run takes up, and assume the number is equal to the textLength (2) and fill up the `_glyphIndices` from there."
">enumeratorMethod.Parameters.Any(p => p.IsParams) [](start = 74, length = 48)

This calculation feels fragile and possibly incorrect in a general case. Presence of ```params``` modifier doesn't actually imply that the argument always has an expanded form. For example, the parameter might not have the right type. Or ```params```, which is just an attribute in metadata, can be on a ""wrong"" parameter. Etc. See, ```OverloadResolution.IsValidParams``` for example. Rather than trying to re-infer this information, I think we should find a way to thread it through from the binding. Also, with recent work to move creation of default values to binding, I would expect that would also take care of param arrays, when necessary.

"What is the purpose of an error message? It's not (necessarily) _just_ to say ""something went wrong."" If that were the sole purpose, we could print out the `Reason` message and be done with it.

The purpose of the error message is _also_ to inform the user of _what_ the problem is in such a way that _they can fix it_.

Your updated message doesn't satisfy that purpose. We just know that unzipping _some file_ failed for _some reason_. We don't know what to do to fix it. Should we clean and rebuild the project? Sacrifice a chicken? Burn the world? Who knows! The error message certainly doesn't say....

As such, the previous message is much better.

"I did some quick and dirty profiling on my current change. One note: I have a pretty degenerate case: Four installations of VS, which adds seven! profiles when both generators are enabled.
1. It looks like CShellLink::SetPath is crazy expensive! Makes me think the longer the jump list gets, the worse startup perf is going to be. Maybe worth a user setting to disable creating jump list entries, separate from creating dynamic or proto-extension profiles.
2. The two generators I added are proportionally about the same amount of CPU time as any one of the other generators.
3. There is a definite opportunity to increase the VS generators performance by caching the instances of ISetupInstance instead of getting them twice. I'll work on that for my next commit.

"In the above `<SupportedPlatform Include=""browser"">` added only for enabling browser warnings for browser targeted or multitargeted build, this actually affected the multitargeted builds of lower targets like `netstandard2.0` but there is still warnings for targeted builds like `netstandard2.0-Linux-Debug`, we wouldn't like to enable warnings for `linux` build. Second not all assemblies have  `UnsupportedOSPlatform(""browser"")`, i added here because this is where assembly level  `UnsupportedOSPlatform(""browser"")` attribute added. 

But after giving into it another look instead of adding `<SupportedPlatform>` i think we should restrict adding the `UnsupportedOSPlatform(""browser"")` for platform targeted builds, we only need that for cross platform build, correct me if i am wrong @github

"> Because doing this correctly adds cost to workaround a server that's actively doing the wrong thing. There are a myriad of ways it could be doing the wrong thing, and by returning the data without error, it's only working around this one very specific way the server is doing it wrong, and in doing so, passing along effectively corrupt data to the consumer. What if the server said it was speaking gzip but sent down data as zlib or deflate? What if the server said it was speaking gzip but didn't send the gzip header, only the compressed body and gzip footer? Etc.

ok, i'm agree with this, but then we could simply return an meaningfull error instead of the wrong error message ""The archive entry was compressed using an unsupported compression method."" and returning something like ""The request is announced to be compressed but isn't a valid gzip stream"" and give the caller an ability to access the underlying stream.

> How similar?

The goal is that all non-obsolete public members and features should eventually be present on both the Mac and Windows hosts. 

It looks like LanguageServerSnippetExpander does indeed exist on both Mac and Windows builds. The one thing to be aware of is that @github made a breaking change to this API May 12th and it probably hasn't yet been inserted to Mac, so we'll have to rev the LSP client before we can insert this version of Roslyn: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/VSLanguageServerClient/pullrequest/398270"

"> Both examples are weakly typed (return object). What is the example for the strongly typed consumer of this?

Possible scenario (though it would require API tweaks):

```cs
// calculate and cache these upfront
Type actualServiceType = environment.GetConcreteTypeForAbstraction(typeof(IMyService));
ObjectFactory<IMyService> factory = ObjectFactory.Create<IMyService>(actualServiceType);

// call this in a hot path, such as per-request
IMyService service = factory.CreateInstance();
```

Or, for an MVC-like framework's per-request processing logic:

```cs
Type controllerType = GetControllerTypeForCurrentRequest();
ObjectFactory<Controller> factory = s_factories[controllerType];
Controller controller = factory.CreateInstance();
Console.WriteLine(controller.GetType()); // could be AdminController, WeatherController, etc.
```

There's nothing stopping us from saying ""`ObjectFactory.CreateInstance` always returns object, not T."" But IMO there is something nice about an API that returns _T_ instead of _object_, meaning you don't have to cast the return value and you don't have to worry about putting the wrong category of factory (`ObjectFactory<IServiceA>` vs. `ObjectFactory<IServiceB>`) into your static cache, etc."
"This is suspicious; the code above says defines param `b`'s type as `{y: typeof b}` , which is self referential and surely wrong."
"We can't move this out because it is a global regex and when you reuse it, the last index will not be at zero so it will produce wrong result. Alternatively we can set the last index to zero but I think this way is more clear

            {
                byte digit = (byte)(value & 0xF);
                buffer[bufferEndIndex] = (char)(digit + (digit < 10 ? (byte)'0' : hexBase));
                value >>= 4;

### Modification B - simplify hex conversion

This modification involves replacing the two jump instructions within the hot loop with a single conditional jump instruction. The conditional jump is only taken if the digit is 'A' - 'F'. If you do this, you'll need to modify [`GetHexBase`](https://source.dot.net/System.Private.CoreLib/R/9e867b5206ddc67d.html) to append a `- '0'` to the end. That modification allows you to perform the `+ hexBase - '0'` operation as a single step.

```cs
        private static int Int32ToHexChars_B(Span<char> buffer, uint value, int hexBase, int digits)
        {
            int bufferEndIndex = buffer.Length;
            while ((--digits >= 0 || value != 0) && /* Only to elide bounds check */ (uint)(--bufferEndIndex) < (uint)buffer.Length)
            {
                uint digit = value & 0xF;
                int c = (int)digit + '0';
                if (digit >= 10) { c += hexBase; }
                buffer[bufferEndIndex] = (char)c;
                value >>= 4;
            }
            return bufferEndIndex;
        }
```

### Modification C - hoist _digits_ and _value_ checks outside the loop

This eagerly calculates how many characters will _actually_ be written as part of the loop, and it resizes the buffer to be the appropriate length before entry to the loop. It's a little more work upfront, but it means the loop itself is very tight since the only condition you're checking is whether you've run off the end of the buffer. In particular, _value_ and _digits_ no longer contribute to the loop evaluation condition dependency chain.

(Edit: On review, I'm passing the wrong parameters to _Slice_, but that's outside the hot loop so it shouldn't affect any theoretical perf numbers.)

```cs
        private static int Int32ToHexChars_C(Span<char> buffer, uint value, int hexBase, int digits)
        {
            int actualHexDigitCount = CountHexDigits(value);
            if (actualHexDigitCount > digits)
            {
                digits = actualHexDigitCount;
            }
            if ((uint)digits < (uint)buffer.Length)
            {
                buffer = buffer.Slice(0, digits);
            }
            
            int i = buffer.Length;
            while((uint)(--i) < (uint)buffer.Length)
            {
                uint digit = value & 0xF;
                value >>= 4;
                int c = (int)digit + '0';
                if (digit >= 10) { c += hexBase; }
                buffer[i] = (char)c;
            }
            
            return buffer.Length;
        }

"> This looks weird. Why would a test project have a reference to its test runner? We don't have that for non mobile OSs.

For non mobile OSs the test runner is XUnit and we get it via a NuGet package. 

In this case the Main application test runner are these test runners which need to wrap xunit in order to make it a runnable mobile app. We need the runners to be in the publish directory and be part of the bundle. Before this change we where hard coding/calculating the path for the runner and copying it manually to the publish dir. Making various things difficult, these were built during Mono builds, which mean that if you follow the split build model like in CI you need to carry them over as artifacts and make sure they land on the right location when building the libraries tests and flow the right runtime configuration, etc. Also in order to reduce size in the bundles we want to run the linker to trim the app, which relies on the SDK list of files that are part of the closure, since we were copying manually these where not consider causing the trim result to be wrong. Another thing, incremental inner dev loop changing these projects was not easy as  you needed to go build them on mono and actually use the same configuration you used for the mono runtime for these to be found, etc.

This is something that all test projects use in mobile so the most natural thing to solve those problems was adding a P2P."
"I understand the concern that you have, but I disagree on some points.

> It should not push down C because the user would then select B instead of C.

You are of course theoretically correct. My arguments here are practical:
1. It doesn't happen that often in practice
2. Clicking on the wrong thing doesn't cost the user anything (UI doesn't change in a dramatic way, can just click again on the intended result)
3. We could throttle updates to predictable intervals (e.g every 1s) so the user can intuitively know when an update might happen.
4. The user can just wait for all results to return (which is what they are forced to do now) before interacting. They are strictly better off with streaming.
5. As long as the user's current selection/view is maintained, I think it is ok for the results around it to be updating.

> It will push down the C-subtree, making the user click the wrong item.

Only if subtree A is expanded. I forget what the behavior is in the PR as it stands now, but we wouldn't need to auto expand any subtree automatically until all results are in. I think the auto expand behavior depends on # results in a subtree so it wouldn't make sense to auto expand anyway until all results are in.

> instead of resetting and resorting all locations we should always have append-insert semantics.

I got the opposite feedback on https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/28751, because the sorting was relevant there. As of right now, I would agree that the sorting isn't as relevant for references here (still a non-zero amount of relevant), but we would be precluding it from being more relevant in the future.

It also seems a little bit inconsistent if we have different behaviors for streaming in different contexts.

"Based on the review comments it seems I haven't done a good job of explaining what I'm trying to accomplish here. 

A compilation event is a muli-process problem for C# / VB. The MSBuild process (of which there are multiple) begins the compilation event by constructing a message that it sends to the VBCSCompiler process (of which there is one). The compiler receives the request, kicks off a `Thread` and then processes the compilation from there. Upon completion it constructs a response and sends it back to MSBuild. 

The log file contains messages from all these different MSBuild processes and all of the threads within VBCSCompiler interleaved. The only identifying marker for message in the log is the process and thread ID. That means reading a log file requires you to figure out which PID maps to which process (MSBuild or VBCSCompiler) and which TID within specific PID (the VBCSCompiler) maps to a given compilation event. That doesn't help a lot thouh though with the core problem which is typically trying to find the compilation that failed then look at all of the log entries for that compilation. Basically filter the log down to all of the events for a compilation and see where it went wrong. 

This PR attempts to address that by doing the following:

- Replace the PID in the log file with a concrete name: either `MSBuild <PID>`, `csc / vbc <PID>` or `VBCSCompiler`. Now at a glance can tell which process wrote the line
- Use a request id (simple `Guid.NewGuid()`) to track a compilation event across the processes. It is created by MSBuild, attached to the protocol and then every process puts that `Guid` into messages when they're writing a log event specific to a request. That makes it incredibly easy to filter out the log file to the events for a given process 

Below is a sample of how the log file looks after this change. Notice that `c8d7ad91-490f-420c-9a96-f3881a8804ca` is the request for a given compilation. I can easily just search for that in the log file, read through the messages now and easily see ever hop along the way to understand how this event was processed. 

```

These ones have no additional info (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/40902#issuecomment-675042706), the others do, like for instance if you have a non-existing unicode property, the error will _also_ show you that wrong property in an additional placeholder.

I don't think it matters much for now, really, as we've decided above to create the internal constructor with the necessary logic, but it won't be called anywhere (the original exceptions remain as they were, of course)."
"> were there particular hostpots where we could benefit from a readonly-dictionary, but also need to clone?

It looked like it was using a Dictionary; but then using `NullableWalker.SaveSharedState()` at various points to create a stack of ImmutableDictionaries representing the snapshots of the Dictionary at various evaluation points; where `.Clone()` would be simpler (e.g. snapshot state now, continue adding items, snapshot, continue adding items), though I may have been reading the code wrong.

"Thanks @github. After my comment I saw @github's twitter [post](https://twitter.com/orta/status/1444958295865937920) and how many people have already questioned this, so I don't want to beat it to death.

For the record, I don't disagree about not wanting to change runtime behaviour and how that is set in stone, I just disagree that it is changing runtime behaviour.

I don't see how converting non-suffixed imports into `*.js` suffixed imports as part of the transpile step would be considered a runtime change in behaviour. To me that is a syntax change, with no runtime behaviour change.

Reading about this more it seems this discussion has become quite entrenched so I will leave it at this comment as I think I've articulated as best I can why I feel this is the wrong conclusion."
"> This PR seems to be written in a way where it detects the testcase it's supposed to be fixing and then changes the result of the computation to match the expected behavior, rather than an edit that addresses a generalized version of what's going wrong. I don't think this is the right approach. This bug is likely quite subtle and might be a very difficult fix contribution.
> 
> Aside: We're generally not able to review PRs that aren't ready to merge. Uses of `any`, left-in debugging code, inconsistent formatting, etc, should all be cleaned up before filing something as a non-draft PR.

Sounds good.  One question about *inconsistent formatting, etc,* - if is passes the typescript rules is that sufficient?  I ask because this code passed the linting - if that's not enough then what is the standard?"
"> we're limiting ourselves to the subset of problems where the developer is prevented from actually doing the ""right thing"" (e.g. they're forced to implement a sync interface and have only async tools at their disposal to do so) rather than the subset where they don't realize they're doing the ""wrong thing"".

I don't think that's true. I think we need some knobs that workloads can use to change behavior, right now what we have works well when everyone plays ball but is quite catastrophic one there's a bad actor somewhere in the system. In that way it might not be the developer that needs to make the choice but potentially framework authors can have more granular control over things.

"The condition felt backwards to me to. When the syntax was recommended https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/49155#discussion_r587757748, it felt wrong, but neglected to ask...

Perhaps `ConditionalFact` uses the condition in the opposite sense than `ActiveIssue`.  I guess that makes sense.  For `ConditionalFact` the condition is when to execute a test.  For `ActiveIssue` the condition describes when to disable a test.

I need to revise this, #49165 & #49155.

Thanks for letting me know @github (with 2 `e`s 😉 )

"Note about the maintenance of the loop table: one can enable (and potentially improve) `fgDebugCheckLoopTable()` for more phases if it is the eventual goal to have the table be maintained. When I did that a while back though, I remember hitting asserts as early as `optUnrollLoops` (because of wrong `bbNatNum`s)."
"> never unsetting the stopping flag.

I thought about that, but it feels wrong to still have ""_stopping = true"" once the Host is done stopping. Maybe I could rename it to `_stopCalled` or similar, then it would feel better."
"I didn't do it for `in` because one of the tests checks that the value doesn't get updated, but it looks like the test was doing the wrong thing (double-checked built-in). Will update."
"I see, thanks for pointing this out. With this change we end up with the node that has all its members optional, however language doesn't allow all three pieces to be omitted at the same type. Please correct me if I am wrong, I believe that language supports these two forms:
- <Identifier> [As <type>] 
- <type>

I think we should consider structuring syntax model accordingly and have a dedicated derived node for each unique syntactic form.

"Yes, we need to address the problem in the analyzer. I don't think there is anything wrong with the API."

"Is there anything we can assert to verify it was a cert error? As is, this would pass even if we put in the wrong address."
"> I guess it also means when shutdown is ungraceful managed code might be forcefully torn down when there's a native code running on a managed threads so AV? 

I think what we want to do is to call `_requestNativeHandle.Dispose()` and await `await new ValueTask<object?>(_requestNativeHandle, _requestNativeHandle.Version);` before calling `CompleteHttpRequest()`. It was previously `http_post_completion` and now presumably `http_indicate_completion` that tells IIS that it's okay to release the backing handle.

The reason we have the weird dispose the SafeHandle then await it logic is to ensure any concurrent p/invokes with the SafeHandle have completed and any future ones will ODE. I think the logic was wrong here previously. We should have been doing this before calling `PostCompletion()` too.

Fortunately, this really only affects buggy code that tries to use the `HttpContext` after middleware complets. Still, it's better to avoid the possible AV."
"I'm a surprised by `ConversionKind.Invalid` here.
In the bound tree, I expect a deconstruction conversion. That conversion is ""secret"" (implementation-only, will likely not be in the spec). I'm not sure how it should be surfaced, but ""invalid"" seems wrong."
">Assign(ref this.StateWhenFalse, slot, true); [](start = 16, length = 44)

This feels wrong, this shouldn't change state of members because no assignment happens during 'is' pattern evaluation. #Closed"
"I just tested whether this works when trying to navigate to an inner class.
I discovered the following issues:
* For `A.B.ClassA.InnerClass` `GetFullReflectionName` returns `A.B.InnerClass`, which is completely wrong.
* The `FullTypeName(string)` ctor expects reflection syntax, so we'd have to use `A.B.ClassA+InnerClass`.
* `CSharpDecompiler.DecompileType` fails when it's passed the name of an inner class. I would say this is by design, but we could improve it by using the top-level type name stored in `FullTypeName`.

So there are two possible fixes:
a) Fix `GetFullReflectionName` to actually return the proper full name using reflection syntax and fix `CSharpDecompiler.DecompileType` to handle nested classes properly.
b) use something like:
```
            while (containingOrThis.ContainingType != null)
            {
                containingOrThis = containingOrThis.ContainingType;
            }
```
to unwrap the inner class before passing it to `GetFullReflectionName`.

I think I will fix the handling in `CSharpDecompiler.DecompileType` in any case."
"> Given the current setup when I hit <kbd>F5</kbd> will the debug fail to launch if the copyright is wrong?

"> I didn't realise there were any issues building the E2ETests project. That sounds serious and we would want to know if that goes wrong. I don't think we should be suppressing that kind of problem (e.g., maybe it reflects some actual SDK issue).

Yeah its usually some variation of something in the basictest app being filed locked, sometimes when compression, sometimes during other build steps. We've had that issue for a long time in some form or another, I saw it on a few builds recently (both locally) and on CI"
"Tagging @github/analyzer-ioperation I think something is wrong here.

I am actually not crazy about putting the key in the word format. In similar places we show the verbatim key (like enums) and I prefer this. The wordifying doesn't work well in some cases and I'd actually like to replace it with more customizable setting labels.

I go to the wrong column which seems based on the offset of my cursor after the text has been removed, not before."

"Thanks very much Martin.

And thank you for finding those issues. My apologies.

I'm embarrassed by the first one. As you say, the problem is in `isBlocked` using the old positions.
Now that the code is in a branch in the Microsoft repository I don't know how I should submit a correction. I think the following would be a minimal change to fix that bug. In foldingRange.ts replace:
```
    if (!isBlocked(hiddenRange.startLineNumber, hiddenRange.endLineNumber)) {
        let decRange = this._textModel.getDecorationRange(this._editorDecorationIds[i]);
        if (decRange
          && decRange.startColumn === Math.max(decRange.endColumn - 1, 1)

```
by
```
    let decRange = this._textModel.getDecorationRange(this._editorDecorationIds[i]);
    if (decRange && !isBlocked(decRange.startLineNumber, decRange.startLineNumber + hiddenRange.endLineNumber - hiddenRange.startLineNumber)) {
        if (decRange.startColumn === Math.max(decRange.endColumn - 1, 1)

```
The second problem is tougher. Typing into a collapsed range seems wrong and I could argue either way for whether the new text should remain visible or not.  Maybe a third choice, should the range automatically unfold when a user does that?  

It gets nastier. Suppose that the first line of a folded region, the one which remains visible, is something like `if (xxx) { // do something`. If the user hits enter in front of the `{` the resulting hidden region should be different than if they use enter after it. And the same is true of the terminating line if it looks like `    } // the end`

I played around with making the decoration region include a larger block of the text and things are still problematic that way. The best overall result seems to come from starting the decoration at the last character + 1 of the region and ending it at the first character of the line following the region. But it isn't perfect, especially when considering the cases mentioned above. And I'm not sure about possible consequences to other parts of the editor from having large decoration ranges hanging around.

I want to mull this over a bit. Maybe there's a simpler way.

By the way, do you recall the reason for the ""isBlocked"" test? I.e. under what conditions there can end up being an active selection point inside a hidden range when ""update"" is called?

"@github: please correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that prior discussion was that it was pointless to do `.ConfigureAwait (continueOnCapturedContext: false)` in a method after having already called it. Here, `.ConfigureAwait()` is called 7 and 11 lines above, so is this invocation necessary?

I think this is the wrong way around— we’re telling TermControl that an OSC 9;9 occurred using its internal API so that it calls TermControl’s working directory handler to trigger the working directory event. Can TerminalApp just handle this at the top layer? :)

I don't know the first thing about PowerShell, so I wouldn't be hugely surprised to find out that there was something wrong with my patch, but the above change causes the script to fail for me.  I'm running it via the `runxamlformat.cmd` batch file if that makes any difference."
"We normally embed a known serialization of the class and compare the generated serialization with it. This code doesn't correctly validate the generated XML as DCS cares about ordering and this validation code will pass even if things are in the wrong order. If DCS expects the order A,B,C and the XML has elements ordered as B,A,C, the value of A won't get set. When it sees B, it goes through the list of potential consuming fields and matches for B. When it sees A, it starts at B in the list and doesn't find a consuming data member. This has a reasonable chance of currently being broken as DCS serializes alphabetically when using DataMember. You probably need to add the Order property on the attributes."
"We can end up starting with the wrong value, but it doesn't really concern me for several reasons:
1. The trigger for starting with the wrong state involves opening a document, and no matter what option is supposed to be used we know the open document is going to be analyzed.
2. The fallback default is the default state for the IDE as a whole. This is a rarely-changed option, so for most users we start in the correct state no matter what.
3. For the majority of cases where the current solution differs from the default state, the solution state includes _more_ analysis content than the default, so even if the value starts out wrong the IDE will not reach a transient state on the way to steady-state where more diagnostics are shown than desired."

Was commenting on the wrong method. Let me try this one again.
"You are correct, is a #ifdef but the code would compile since we are just defining the new delegate to be called AVAudioSourceNodeRenderHandler2 now, but not in the future, so we have:

* AVAudioSourceNodeRenderHandler2 - Now 
* AVAudioSourceNodeRenderHandler - Once XAMCORE_4 is defined.

The description of the compat files is correct, but in this case we are not create a method for compatibility reasons, but because it was wrong, so I personally would leave the handler definition were it is, with the fixed sample code I gave. In this case, code locality is important, we keep the delegate signature with the API definition.

tldr; We put inside a #ifdef XAMCORE_4 all those API fixes that we would like to do, but we can since it will break the API. One time, in the future, we will be allow to do it, and we will have nicer APIs. I've heard we had several, but I've never seen one, but XAMCORE_2 etc.. exist."
"It crashes only on local devices if there is a bonjour service present. The issue is that there is an assert in the delegate, in simulator, there are no issues, on a device you might get an assert failing and will raise an exception in the delegate that crashes the app. Could be that you do have bonjour services and the assumptions are wrong.

I think this is code left over from an initial attempt at generic local functions, but I'm not sure - I'll check tomorrow when I'm back at my computer (and delete it if it's unused). In any case, this area will get rewritten once generic local functions are fully allowed.
"
"Removed that part. Find out in FileCleanupTestBase path was wrong for osx, updated that."
"Definitely not a dumb question, and I'm not even sure I understand it myself. :-)

Here's what I understand: `GenTreeCall` has three different fields that store nodes related to args: `gtCallThisArg`, `gtCallArgs` and `gtCallLateArgs`. The two former fields are what I call ""early args"" here while the latter is the ""late args"".
Before morph, the latter is not used, the early args just store the operand nodes for the call. Life is good.
`fgMorphArgs`, as part of morph, is responsible for setting calls up for the optimization/backend to handle, and among other things handles ABI details of how to pass the argument in either registers or on the stack. 

This comes with a constraint: we cannot start placing values in registers (and for non-x86, on the stack) before we have evaluated the arguments, if the arguments contain calls. To handle these cases morph will replace the early arguments with evaluation nodes that evaluate the argument into a temp, and then the temp will be put in the late args. In some cases no evaluation is necessary (e.g. for a simple constant) and the operand will end up either in the early or late args, depending on whether it is going on the stack or in registers.

So for a call like `GetThis().M(Arg1(), 10, Arg2())` we end up transforming something like
```scala
GT_CALL
  gtCallThisArg: GT_CALL GetThis
  gtCallArgs[0]: GT_CALL Arg1
  gtCallArgs[1]: GT_CNS_INT 10
  gtCallArgs[2]: GT_CALL Arg2
```
into
```scala
GT_CALL
  gtCallThisArg: GT_ASG tmp0 (GT_CALL GetThis)
  gtCallArgs[0]: GT_ASG tmp1 (GT_CALL Arg1)
  gtCallArgs[1]: GT_ARGPLACE
  gtCallArgs[2]: GT_ASG tmp2 (GT_CALL Arg2)
  gtCallLateArgs[0]: GT_LCL_VAR tmp0
  gtCallLateArgs[1]: GT_LCL_VAR tmp1
  gtCallLateArgs[2]: GT_CNS_INT 10
  gtCallLateArgs[3]: GT_LCL_VAR tmp2
```

For stack arguments we might not need any entry in `gtCallLateArgs`, so there isn't a 1-1 correspondence between args and late args.

The code in lower is then responsible for creating the nodes to actually place these args into the stack/registers. Morph has pretty much done all the work at this point so this is just creating `GT_PUTARG_REG` and `GT_PUTARG_STK` nodes and inserting them after the corresponding args in the early/late args lists. These particular nodes is what this comment is talking about: it moves them further down than they would normally be, since it needs to insert a call very late (after evaluation of the call target that comes after the late args nodes)."
"> It's not a regression as the same inputs give you the same outputs but as a user this now reads wrong to me and I think an ArgumentException would be better suited now.

There are many places where if the code were being written from scratch we would choose to use a different exception type than is currently being used.  But changing from a more derived type to one of its base types is a breaking change, and so we need a good reason to do so."
This seems to be going in the wrong direction - a declaration shouldn't block an assignment to that same property
The removal of this error is still wrong.
Update: this _is_ currently wrong (that’s why tests are failing)—although I’m pretty sure some iteration of this logic worked yesterday—but it’s quite difficult to discern exactly what kind of symbol appears in the `symbols` array here; it seems like sometimes it’s the `localSymbol` and sometimes it’s the `exportSymbol`. Still investigating and revising this section.
"> This is not a connection aborted by the peer but ourselves. So INVALID_STATE here is expected,

Because the connection is aborted by us, then I as a user would expect all pending operations to throw `QuicOperationAbortedException`, in line with https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/55619 (as currently outlined).

> user is doing something wrong.

If by the user you mean the test code above, then I disagree. The connection is accessed from a single thread, and opening the stream was attempted before trying to close the connection. I can imagine that in a real use case, there would be more logic between the call to OpenStreamAsync and CloseAsync (behind some condition). There is no data race evident in the user code. If we start throwing `QuicException` with `INVALID_STATE`, we start leaking implementation details.

> I'm rather surprised we get sometimes ABORTED.

Side note: this can happen while we are waiting for the stream limit to increase (i.e. PEER_ACCEPTED event) and peer closes the connection on us."
"So i don't want unnecessary _work_ to be done in the registration method.  i.e. don't do things that are _expensive_ and not needed until the fix is actually applied.

What can be in the registration method is:
1. Any work necessary to determine which code fixes to provide.  For example, if multiple fixes may be given, but those fixes are conditioned on tests you need to perform.  Ideally this work is cheap.
2. Extracting out appropriate data _cheaply_ from teh context menu to pass to the fixes.

The reason i don't like passing the context around is that there's a good chance the wrong cancellation token will be used.  (even i've made that mistake).

So the ideal code here for me would be:

``` c#
c => await AddBracesAsync(context.Whatever, context.Whatever, ..., c);
```

Then AddBracesAsync only has what it needs, and only sees one potential cancellation token.  
"
"I don't think this is the appropriate fix. I think the right fix is to make sure that nobody is actually passing in `undefined`, so find the type assertions that are wrong."
"So the problem is as follows:
1. Our per language options only allow us to set a default across all languages.  
2. We don't want the default for this option to be either true or false.  Each of those is wrong for one of our two primary languages.
3. So this is actually a tri-state.  'null' means 'language default'.  'true' and 'false' means ""the user chose these explicit values.

We use this pattern for all options that differ in their defaults between C# and VB.  It allows us to have a 'default' that still gets the right legacy/historical behavior for these two languages.

"> There is nothing wrong with writing tests the old way (customers and ourselves have been doing it this way for years)

This is most certainly true, but doing this requires a lot of knowledge of how roslyn works to set up correctly. The hope is that for common scenarios this is abstracted away."
"> My understanding is that this still doesn't address the underlying concerns. From the linked issue: [...]

Outside of the message you answered being a year and a half old, the problem isn't ""should the design be X"" or ""should the design be Y"", but rather that the TS team appears unwilling to even engage to find a way forward.

Of course if standardizing the JSON format was the only way to get this merged it'd already have been done - but the last message from them was from October 2020, was based on incorrect information, was never publicly reevaluated once corrected, and didn't include any actual action item (such as ""we like the idea, we'll merge it if you rework it so that X / Y / Z criterias are met"").

In fact, it didn't even explicitly request a change in this PR to make it JSON-based, rather suggesting that this use case should be fulfilled via a plugin system that evidently won't see the light of day anytime soon.

From my perspective, the only thing to do that would actually help bringing PnP support to TS  would be for teams *within Microsoft* to actually use it and advocate for it, as it's rather clear it won't be a priority until then. From the outside unfortunately, there isn't much to do but to wait and periodically rebase this PR. Of course I'd love to be proven wrong! I really like TS and the work its maintainers have been doing, outside of this difficult contributing experience.

---

*(Note that I've been considering standardizing the JSON format in the next major, Yarn 4, precisely because Esbuild's maintainer expressed some interest into supporting it if we did so. But as far as TS is concerned this is largely irrelevant, because the real issue is the lack of feedback loop. For all I know they may even have silenced this thread.)*"

With TrimRootCertificate=false, the old logic would incorrectly increase count when chain.Build() return partial chain. That would later cause ArgumentOutOfRangeException when iterating through the chain certificate collection.

Further more, the TrimRootCertificate is swapped. If we want to trim root we need to subtract 2 (e.g. root itself and leaf cert) This will cause wrong number of certificates sent on the wire on Unix. (on Windows all the logic is bolted to OS) 

To fix this, I refactor the code a little bit. There is no need to invoke the partial chain logic at all if we are going to give whole chain to OS (Windows)  

I added variant to SslStream_UntrustedCaWithCustomCallback_OK and verified it will expose the ArgumentOutOfRangeException without the fix.

"So I'm trying to run some benchmarks on this and am having difficulty.

I setup two separate copies of this repo on my machine, one for the main branch and one for my branch. I was able to build each of these eventually after several errors but a `git clean -dfx` helped. Then I followed the guide from the performance repo at https://github.com/dotnet/performance/blob/master/src/benchmarks/micro/README.md#private-runtime-builds and got a bunch of errors saying dotnet 6.0 is not supported by the SDK. I then added the path to main branch repo's dotnet.exe to my environment variables and was able to get the benchmarks to run but they failed with my branch's changes. Am I doing things wrong?"

There's 0% benefit on any Windows system with any file system?  I question whether that's actually the case.

I haven't looked at IIS's behavior, so I could be wrong here. But it seems to me by looking at the existing buggy code that QueryStringAppend was meant apply to the pattern and QueryStringDelete was meant to apply to the request query string.


Configuration | Behavior
-- | --
Append = false; Delete = true | No query string ever. Works today.
Append = false; Delete = false | Only request query string. Works today.
Append = true; Delete = false | Merge query string. Works today.
Append = true; Delete = true | Only pattern query string. Still broken.

That said. If you wanted to strip the query string from the pattern, you could just not include a query string in the pattern. It would be a lot simpler if QueryStringAppend controlled whether or not to keep the request query string and have the pattern query string always appended if present. I'm not sure if this is compatible with IIS's behavior though.

"> I do think we should consider not changing the behavior here, but still annotating these as non-nullable (as proposed above).

We should not do that.  Either we're confident that no concrete implementations will return null (either explicitly or because they don't override the base method and get the base's null-returning behavior), or we're not.  If we're confident it never happens, then the methods can be non-nullable and can be changed to throw.  If we're not confident, then annotating them as non-nullable but returning null is making things worse: we're claiming to consumers they can trust they'll never get back null, but that's simply not true.

Just to make sure it's clear, too, concrete providers can be annotated to return non-nullable even when the base virtual is null-returning.  So, for example, even if we have:
```C#
public abstract class DbProviderFactory
{
    public virtual DbCommand? CreateCommand() => null;
    ...
}
```
we can still have:
```C#
public sealed class SqlClientFactory : DbProviderFactory, IServiceProvider
{
    public override DbCommand CreateCommand() => new SqlCommand();
}
```
Anyone using SqlClientFactory directly would see that CreateCommand returns a non-nullable DbCommand; only when using the base provider would they see that it returns nullable.

We also don't need to do the same thing for every method in question.  The ones we're talking about are these 8?
```C#
public abstract class DbProviderFactory
{
    public virtual DbCommand CreateCommand() => null; 
    public virtual DbCommandBuilder CreateCommandBuilder() => null;
    public virtual DbConnection CreateConnection() => null;
    public virtual DbConnectionStringBuilder CreateConnectionStringBuilder() => null;
    public virtual DbDataAdapter CreateDataAdapter() => null;
    public virtual DbParameter CreateParameter() => null;
    public virtual CodeAccessPermission CreatePermission(PermissionState state) => null;
    public virtual DbDataSourceEnumerator CreateDataSourceEnumerator() => null;
}
```
plus
```C#
public abstract class DbConnection
{
    protected virtual DbProviderFactory DbProviderFactory => null;
}
```
right?

Looking at https://source.dot.net and https://referencesource.microsoft.com/, I see every single code path that ends up hitting this (generally via DbProviderFactories.GetProvider) then null checks the result and throws if null was returned.  And looking around on github, I see lots of code that just assumes it's not null and dereferences the result without checking.  So (and please correct me if I'm wrong), that other than the type itself using its own protected override, null being returned is already effectively considered an error.  If that's true, DbConnection.DbProviderFactory could be made non-nullable and changed to throw with minimal impact.

Looking just at dotnet/runtime, neither `OdbcFactory` nor `OleDbFactory` overrides `CreateDataSourceEnumerator`, so they're going to inherit the base method behavior; same for `EntityProviderFactory` in reference source.  Even if we were to ""fix"" those, that's a key indicator that other implementations are unlikely to override it either.  So that needs to be `DbDataSourceEnumerator?`.

Code Access Security is deprecated, so `CreatePermission` doesn't really matter.  It can return `CodeAccessPermission?` and if folks get warnings, great, they should stop using it.  Even without that, though, I see implementations not overriding it and thus inheriting the base null-returning implementation, e.g. https://github.com/Glimpse/Glimpse/blob/master/source/Glimpse.Ado/AlternateType/GlimpseDbProviderFactory.cs.

You mentioned that ""CreateCommandBuilder and CreateDataAdapter return null on Microsoft.Data.Sqlite"" (as can CreatePermission and CreateDataSourceEnumerator, per https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core/SqliteFactory.cs).  If they return null for such a prominent implementation, that's a warning sign.  On to of that, if memory serves these were introduced later than the other methods, which means implementations based on the original DbProviderFactory surface area wouldn't have overridden these because they didn't exist; that's exemplified in examples like https://github.com/mysql-net/MySqlConnector/blob/master/src/MySqlConnector/MySqlConnectorFactory.cs and https://github.com/jonwagner/Insight.Database/blob/master/Insight.Database.Core/DbConnectionWrapperProviderFactory.cs, where these methods won't be overridden when targeting surface area like .NET Standard 1.6 or .NET Core 1.1.  So... CreateCommandBuilder and CreateDataAdapter should return nullable.

Here's an implementation that doesn't override either CreateParameter or CreateConnectionStringBuilder:
https://github.com/CollaboratingPlatypus/PetaPoco/blob/development/PetaPoco/OracleProvider.cs
And another:
https://github.com/cyq1162/cyqdata/blob/master/DAL/NoSql/NoSqlFactory.cs
And another that doesn't override CreateConnectionStringBuilder:
https://github.com/Lifeng-Liang/DbEntry/blob/master/src/Leafing.MockSql/RecorderFactory.cs
And here's one that explicitly returns null from CreateConnectionStringBuilder:
https://github.com/Dogwei/Swifter.Json/blob/master/Swifter.Data/ProxyProviderFactory.cs
and here's one that doesn't override anything other than CreateCommand or CreateConnection:
https://github.com/ChrisFulstow/NBlog/blob/e50a75d83a85e9a31e2ab7fc1a1c8fa7d29e1fa7/NBlog.Web/Models/PetaPoco.cs#L2175-L2207

I couldn't find any implementations that returned null from CreateConnection/CreateCommand.  Maybe we could get away with making those two non-nullable and throwing from the base.

If all of the above makes sense, that would leave us with:
```C#
public abstract class DbProviderFactory
{
    public virtual DbCommand CreateCommand();
    public virtual DbConnection CreateConnection();

    public virtual DbCommandBuilder? CreateCommandBuilder();
    public virtual DbConnectionStringBuilder? CreateConnectionStringBuilder();
    public virtual DbDataAdapter? CreateDataAdapter();
    public virtual DbParameter? CreateParameter();
    public virtual CodeAccessPermission? CreatePermission(PermissionState state);
    public virtual DbDataSourceEnumerator? CreateDataSourceEnumerator();
}

public abstract class DbConnection
{
    protected virtual DbProviderFactory DbProviderFactory { get; }
}
```
but I'd like more data from @github's data sources, if possible.  And with most of the above returning nullable, it may just make sense to do the simple / honest / non-breaking thing, and return nullable from all of them, reflecting exactly the implementation we have today."

https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet/blob/f190a1566f61f29e1909fe6b7dcbb7140c404908/src/GraphQL.Tests/NRTTests.cs

The problem is that when enumerating the generic type definitions of `Tuple<Tuple<string?, string?>, string>`, and specifically the first generic type `Tuple<string?, string?>`, the code does not increment the index of the nullability byte in the metadata by 3 (non-null, nullable, nullable) but instead only increments it by 1.  So it reads the wrong byte value from the attribute.

I have changed the `GetNullabilityInfo` private method to accept a `ref` index argument so that it can update the index properly based on the number of nested types (and whether or not those nested types utilize a nullability byte, since non-generic value types do not).

I would be happy to add tests, but I'm not sure where in the codebase to do so.

Normally this does not manifest because (it seems?) the JIT does not report dying GC pointer registers until after calls, so the wrong internal view is not really published.
Simple solution for now is to avoid reporting dying GC regs for the validation helper, but it would also be nice to fix the wrong internal view in the JIT."
"This is wrong and is going to break other languages.

Index Of depends on the collation which does sorting. What you have mentioned is not true. 

Maybe in your case, consider using Ordinal options instead.


```C#
            CultureInfo enCI = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(""en-US"");

            CultureInfo thCI = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(""th-TH"");
            CultureInfo.CurrentCulture = thCI;
            Console.WriteLine($""{""SomeText"".IndexOf(""-"")}"");     // this print 0

We should think in different way to optimize this case."
The azure-pipelines bot went crazy and posted a bunch of comments saying it ran the queues. But it didn't re-run the cancelled legs.
"I don't feel like this layout flip is testable with unit test, so added a sample view, but let me know if i am wrong"
"Can you collect a binlog of the test project? It appears the test project is getting the wrong versions of dependencies, but I'm not sure why. Possibly due to Directory.Build.targets/props imports."
"Further reading now leads me to believe that finalizers don't run ""during"" a GC where the runtime might suspend threads, but that finalization merely triggered by the collection adding objects-waiting-to-be-finalized to the finalizer queue. So the object being finalized is still alive as far as GC is concerned until the object is dequeued from the finalizer queue by the finalizer thread and the object is no longer referenced (that is *if* the object is no longer referenced). When collections are actually run, even the finalizer thread is suspended at least if concurrent garbage collection is disabled.

This is making me think that the effort we go through to reconstruct the MemoryPoolBlock might not be worth it, and that we should just add `this` back to the pool in the finalizer and ""resurrect"" the MemoryPoolBlock. We'd probably need call GC.ReRegisterForFinalize though.

I'm not writing this long explanation because I'm confident I'm correct. I just want to explain my current understanding so the experts can clear up what I'm wrong about."
"I'm on the fence about ValueTask. On one hand, RequestDelegate doesn't return a ValueTask and we're not returning an async *value* so we can just use Task.CompletedTask where appropriate. On the other hand, ValueTask gives us the most flexibility if we ever want to try anything crazy like returning pooled tasks for async operations. Of course, that's only worthwhile if whoever is awaiting the action doesn't immediately convert the ValueTask to a Task like the middleware pipeline would.

What potential IResults are you thinking of that don't write a response? I know StatusCodeResult for example doesn't flush the response so something could completely change the response afterwards, but in practice it's effectively writing a response with the specified status code and an empty body the vast majority of the time.

I know technically an IResult could do nothing or anything, but I think naming the method after what it does the majority of the time makes sense. Are there use cases for IResult that have nothing to do with the response that I'm not considering?"

"I think we might need to be more restrictive in how we detect the pseudoselector. It would be a breaking change. 

Today we support selectors like “.myelems::first-of-type .another”.

Would it work to just detect “ends with ::after” but not otherwise look for :: appearing anywhere?

Sorry I was wrong saying we could throw if there are unrecognised pseudoselectors. We can’t if we want to continue allowing things like ::last-child etc. 

I think it will be ok to just recognise ::after at the very end of the string. It would also be nice to specifically recognise ending with ::before and throw since otherwise people might get confused. Those two didn’t have any supported meaning before so that’s non breaking. But other pseudoselectors could be ignored. 

Does that sound reasonable?"
"These last two error messages aren't easily recoverable from by the end-user. In which case, we should just display the generic `Unhandled exception occurred` message (thoughts?). Developers will still be able to see what went wrong in the developer console."

"Mostly paranoia.  The correct dumping behavior across process architectures can only be implemented by spawning a capture process with the desired architecture (at least according to the limited documentation I can find).  

There is no documentation on how this process spawning works.  Assuming it just looks for the correct process next to it.  But I'm unsure if it correctly passes along the `--accepteula` flag.  If it didn't it would result in a Jenkins hang.  Seems wrong to fix a jenkins hang with a jenkins hang.  So just maknig it simple here and picking the right architecture.

Would be willing to undo this if we could find some docs that point to `--acepteula` being passed along correctly.  Can't test locally though because I've already accepted it.

"Is sending back HTTP/1.1 on a HTTP/2 connection be legal? Sure, the client is wrong, but do two wrongs make a right?

Changing the server response is a much bigger piece of work. To do that I think this would need to be completely robust (i.e. when detecting the error, read additional content until either the end of the line or max request line length is reached). Then send a valid HTTP/1.1 response. That's a lot more work.

"@github I don't see record of a discussion about trying to catch this with an analyzer. It's not generally possible to be sure (either way) whether it's unbounded. But an analyzer that forced a pattern of passing a constant value would be doable.

Looking at all our stackallocs, almost all of them already pass a constant directly or via a constant field or local. The few exceptions are not self evidently safe by eyeball, eg.,
```c#
        private static unsafe int EncryptDecryptHelper(OP op, ISSPIInterface secModule, SafeDeleteContext context, Span<SecurityBuffer> input, uint sequenceNumber)
        {
            Interop.SspiCli.SecBufferDesc sdcInOut = new Interop.SspiCli.SecBufferDesc(input.Length);
            Span<Interop.SspiCli.SecBuffer> unmanagedBuffer = stackalloc Interop.SspiCli.SecBuffer[input.Length];
```
and it would be easy for one of them to be wrong. Would it be reasonable to have an analyzer that required them to be rewritten in constant terms, or at least something the analyzer could recognize like
```c#
            Span<Interop.SspiCli.SecBuffer> unmanagedBuffer = stackalloc Interop.SspiCli.SecBuffer[Math.Min(input.Length, BufferSize)];
```"

5. I change my locale to Spanish-MX
6. My defaults.json and settings.json are unchanged
7. To use commandline args, I need to call `wt -p ""Command Prompt - Spanish Edition""` (but like, with the actual localized string)

Separately, what I'm confused about is, can't we just use your `%Version%` code from before? Just add a `%CmdName%`, then replace it with a localized name? This would fail on everything past step 5, but is that an important scenario?

And we wouldn't have to worry about `wt -p ""<localized cmd name>""` because we search through the profiles be a normal name, so that'd be ok?"

"It's safe to assume that strings are immutable. __However__, code paths like this have a tendency to get refactored such that their inputs become `ROS<char>` instead of `string`, and at that point all immutability guarantees are void.

That said, what's the worst thing that can happen if the span contents end up changing mid-operation? We accidentally read the wrong directory names, maybe resulting in an i/o error and exception? That's probably ok, not the end of the world. We accidentally read off the end of a buffer and start corrupting memory? That's unacceptable.

So if we pessimistically assume that the contents may be mutable in a future release, and we also think that the consequences of something being mutated out from under us isn't really all that bad, then I wouldn't worry too much about it. :)

As an example of this in action, see [`string.Replace`'s implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/10e107debae28de4bd1e710cfe448be3c293e841/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/String.Manipulation.cs#L1055), which uses an index-based approach as you ponder here, and which does not defend against mutation. If it ever gets refactored to depend on `ROS<char>`, worst case behavior is that we'll end up inserting improper substitutions into the output string. But we _won't_ run off the end of the buffer and corrupt memory. So it's not worth putting a guard in here."

1. The IDE will have no way to disambiguate and so it doesn't matter what we put in source. `nint` will be displayed by the tooling. These types in ECMA-335 (runtime spec) were never designed to be different. C# decided to disambiguate them while other languages, such as F# did not. C# trying to disambiguate them turned this into a massive leaky abstraction where its trying to express a difference that doesn't actually exist, which definitely doesn't exist in several other languages, and which fundamentally breaks down the more `System.IntPtr` gets used and gets support for integer like operations.

2. People having a pre-conceived notion that `IntPtr` means ""pointer like"" is wrong and needs to be changed. This is and always has been an incorrect association and is one that extends beyond the boundaries of just .NET. `IntPtr` comes from C/C++ where the corresponding name `intptr_t` exists. It is in the same format and of the same meaning as `Int32`. That is `Int` meaning `integer` and `32` meaning `32-bits`. Therefore `IntPtr` is `Int` meaning `integer` and `ptr` meaning `ptr-bits` (same width as a pointer).

The official guidance and what the `System.IntPtr` docs are being updated to indicate is that while you can use `IntPtr` to expose/represent/pass pointers and handles, this is unsafe and error prone. Usage needs to be carefully considered and primarily done in cases where the corresponding language doesn't have pointer support. In languages that support them handles and pointers should be represented as pointers or a type-safe wrapper (such as by correctly deriving `SafeHandle`). Trying to represent a `ushort*` as an `IntPtr` is unsafe, as is trying to represent a `HWND` as an `IntPtr`. Sometimes this is appropriate for interop code, but even there it is ""technically incorrect"" and could run into ABI issues on future platforms.

We should definitely follow our own guidance where it isn't a breaking change. But otherwise, the few remaining cases where it is a pointer being exposed ""safely"", people will get adjusted to the difference with time and it will be ultimately no different than seeing `intptr_t`, `uintptr_t`, or one of the many other typedefs in C/C++ which have the same meaning."
"That walks upward, which is the wrong direction. I need to remove the parens, not walk up from the inside to the outermost parens."
"> If you throw an exception you can also test the behavior on incorrect inputs.

What is an incorrect input?  How do we test that?  The point is that we don't know for certain exactly how the compiler works here.  If we could generate these inputs we would just test these cases and make the code work.

This is about how to write code that isn't sure about all the possible cases that can come through and isn't 100% sure how the compiler will treat things (since it's not documented).  

So we write to what we hope is happening, but we are resilient to being wrong.  As above, i'm fine with telemetry/watson here as that's just a feedback channel.  I'm not fine with a crash/throw/contract as those do not fit.  Reporting a contract violation about a non-violated contract is not correct. "

| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| old | 7827 | 7868 | 65 |
| new | 7839 | 7839 | 67 |

So the new file is making some sense but if you use the old total value then the new one looks like a regression. 
The prolog group in the old file was the same as the new file, in both it reports the size as 67 bytes.
I'm tempted to say the regression isn't real because the numbers in the base are wrong.

- Remove the Obsolete attributes from IIS and Kestrel's old BadHttpRequestException, they'll still be used as they are now
- Move all of the internal members from Kestrel's old BadHttpRequestException and have them in KestrelBadHttpRequestException instead which will derive from Kestrel's old BadHttpRequestException 

I also have a question about AllowedHeader. That is currently only used in the following two places https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/d1d9b97f77cfe672618512e30b5b78b81ce44ff2/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http/Http1Connection.cs#L427

"Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I can see the existing code that is being improved here isn't optimal in the first place. We don't have to make the hashing faster if we remove the need for expensive hashing.

Reasons:
* The only place where `_textFormatMap` is being used is inside `DxFontRenderData::TextFormatWithAttribute`
* `_textFormatMap` is cleared when the font changes and can only contain a single font ❗
* `_textFormatMap` lookup only occurs with `weight`, `style` and `stretch` (let's abbreviate it as ""WSS"")

My personal conclusion:
The hash function for `_textFormatMap` only needs to hash WSS and that's it. We can improve the performance of hashing by inlining the FNV1a algorithm, which requires around 4ns for 12 bytes (the amount of data we need to hash) in my experience. If we use xxHash we can reduce it to 1-2ns.

Yes, in fact that was the original version of the fix, and the only place I had to fix was the importer. I went back and forth on this a few times, and ultimately decided to have the change initially be with this more conservative implementation, because it is ""guaranteed"" (not really because I did not add it to the constructor, but nothing calls the constructor directly) to always return ""correct"" result to the caller.

"I've just quickly checked which tests are failing when unwrapping is commented out and seeing following types of failures we check for (84 tests failures total in System.Text.Json.Tests alone):
- property/element/key type is not valid for serialization - this is happening when converter is determined and converter is required for constructing JsonTypeInfo
- while determining properties: invalid naming policies etc. - this could potentially be delayed although it cannot be moved to `Configure` - the latest we can move that to is when user first time accesses properties (we will have to do that for source gen already)
- invalid converter (i.e. different converter type that property type) - again this should be done during construction
- extension property is of wrong type - this could also potentially be slightly delayed (to first time accessing properties)
- invalid property type
- couple of other sanity errors (i.e. combining number handling with custom converter for numbers)
I'll stop checking here.

Given above I don't think it can really be delayed. Also note that this is happening only during construction of JsonTypeInfo which is a one time operation"

"Briefly: no.

This logic could be wrong in two ways. It could return false when it should return true; it could miss a `this.x` reference nested on the rhs of a binary expression with a `this.x` lhs. Making this code more complex raises the risk of this happening; I can only think of it missing `this[""x""]` right now. Missing a `this.x` reference produces (1) `any` (2) a bogus error, just like today.

Or it could return true when it should return false, which is the case you're pointing out. In this case, a single declaration incorrectly produces `any`, but other declarations will still provide the correct type, which will sometimes result in the right type being assigned to the property.

The penalty for being wrong isn't that bad, and the code is no longer so simple, so I don't think it's worth it, especially since no customers have complained that the *current* behaviour isn't correct."

"Because that's what we merged for `combineUnionParameters` in https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/32056 :V

Also, ""some name is better than arg0"" isn't really true. Names carry semantic meaning, so let's say you have `(index: number) => any` and `(object: Whatever): any ` - calling the result `index` where's it's type is `number | Whatever` has the potential to be misleading. Particularly problematic is when the types are the _same_, but semantically different, like
`(length: number): any[]` and `(firstElement: number): any[]` - yeah, `number` is the type of both, but there're not semantically the same! So calling both ""length"" or ""firstElement"" would be dead wrong. Now, I had a _super old_ version of this that concatenated the names in cases like this, to `lengthOrFirstElement`, but that was shot down as too easily producing names that are unwieldy as unions grow. And thus, the preference for `arg0` was born. It carries no information, thus you can draw no (potentially inaccurate) conclusion as to the usage of the parameter."

I fixed minor problems from review; however I ran into problems dealing with File.Replace. Filed doc issue https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/22288 ; the code might also be wrong in master.
"The problem here is one of readability and cognitive burden just trying to parse out the expression to figure out things like precedence.  For example, just reading this i kept seeing it as:

`!!(node.initializer || isBindingPattern(node.parent)) && hasInitializer(<VariableDeclaration>node.parent.parent);`

I was then stuck for ages going ""why, if the node has an initializer, do you then need to check that the grandparent of the node has an initializer as well?""

Seeing and properly breaking up these complex conditionals is very tricky and easy to get wrong.  Even when finally seeing the appropriate location for the parens, it is then necessary to perform complex lookahead mentally to determine precedence.  For example, when reading this left to right you start with:

""ok, if the node has an initializer _or_ if it is a binding pattern"".  When you then reach the && you have to then go back and figure out what portion the && applies to.   ""oh.  it's on the right of a paren.  Ok.... let me backtrack and find the start paren.  Ok.  Found it.  Now what precedes that.  Was it something with lower or higher priority than what i started with?  Wait.  What did i start with again?"" :)

Now, there are many ways to address this to make the code more readable.  One way is to go the imperative route (which is my personal preferred form most of the time).  However, if that is distasteful, an alternative way is to instead rewrite things like so:

```
    return node.initializer || isBindingPatternWithInitializer(node.parent);
}

function isBindingPatternWithInitializer(node: Node) {
    return isBindingPattern(node) && hasInitializer(<VariableDeclaration>node.parent);
}
```

Now the code is _much_ clearer in how it should be read and how it shoudl be interpreted.   The naming gives an intuition as to what's going on, and there doesn't need to be time spent just trying to break down a complex conditional into something more reasonable in the brain.   It is still simple, functional, boolean expressions.  Just with appropriate clarity added to make comprehending it much simpler.

"@github I just tried on a project that I tried to convert to .NET Core many months ago and I can confirm that it finally works on x86 as well (using ACE/Jet driver).

"When `useDefineForClassFields` is false, `es2022` transforms simple static class fields into class static init blocks. This is a problem for users that need `useDefineForClassFields` ([lit](https://lit.dev) requires this).

https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?target=9#code/MYGwhgzhAECC0G8BQ1XQgFzBglsaY0AvNAORikDcSAvkA

input: 
```ts
class A {
  static a = 'a';
}
```

output:
```js
""use strict"";
class A {
    static { this.a = 'a'; }
}
```

In my case, I have library sources that use decorators and need to be compiled with set semantics, but I also want them to have untranspiled private fields, which are widely supported.

Thank you for considering this case."

"> Why tell mode?

### Short answer

It's all build infrastructure. Well, not quite but&hellip;

### More correct answer

The main changes are in a tool (`RazorSyntaxGenerator`) that does not ship and is only used manually. I am changing a single generated source file but only its contained `#line` pragmas and only to satisfy Roslyn.

### Background

The change corrects build failures I've repeatedly seen locally but aren't yet happening on the CI.

The src/Shared/ErrorPage/ErrorPage.Designer.cs file is checked into the repo and compiled into a number of our projects. Newer versions of Roslyn validate the generated `#line` pragmas in this file and complain when the ErrorPage.cshtml file isn't found because it's in the src/Shared/ErrorPage/Views sub-directory. That is, builds fail because the `#line` pragmas are wrong.

We fixed this in 'master' but haven't done the same in 'release/5.0' yet. This will soon be necessary because the Roslyn compiler ships (in part) with VS and core-eng updates VS on the build agents.

The specific fix is to correct the tool used to generate the ErrorPage.Designer.cs file (`RazorSyntaxGenerator`) and then use it to fix the `#line` pragmas.

An alternate fix would be to move the generated file into the Views sub-directory and then change the references in consuming projects. I chose the current fix because it was somewhat more localized and gave me an opportunity to fix the ""script also did not know `RazorSyntaxGenerator` had moved to this repo"" bit."
"Then is it the case that part of the implementation in the provider is in the wrong place, given that the `ActionDescriptor` itself is created here?

The class modified here implements `IActionDescriptorProvider`, so I don't quite follow the argument that only action descriptor providers should modify it because it is one.

It's also not really modified per se, as it's just completely empty - there is no metadata at all, as it was constructed just a few lines earlier.

The application has no prior access to the `ActionDescriptor` before the method returns because it is the source of it.

If that's still incorrect, then I'll close this PR. In that case though, what is the intended design that would allow the action's metadata to be accessible to the API Explorer for inspection?

I think that would still require checking if we are making any progress, but in a different place. I'd rather keep this logic here, to avoid people calling the wrong helper unintentionally.

"The risk I see with your steps @github is that in the window between 1 and 3 anybody could write a code fix that uses JTF now works, and then gets broken when we do 3. And that window in time may not be small -- I assume we'd ship at least one or two minor releases in meantime. In some sense we used the code we had here as a (partial) block so anybody trying to do the ""wrong thing"" would find out because their code doesn't work; if it suddenly does work they won't find out until it's perhaps too late and our mutual customers are getting hangs. I look at that very much as an opening of the barn door: we might be able to close it again, but the horse has already left either way.

Do we have confidence that this fix actually works? Given this is potentially waiting on tasks that have already kicked off or might be using AsyncLazy or something else that isn't JTF-aware in the implementation of ICodeFixService, is JTF able to let the right things through here? My concern here being an independent question of ""is JTF wise?"" but rather ""is JTF actually going to work here given we have an existing body of code that in places is not following JTF rules?""

I don't know if JTF has support built in but we _could_ do something where we have a handshake between the code fix at hand and the Wait() we do on the UI thread to make a SwitchToMainThreadAsync()-like method that is able to run code despite being in that wait. Conceptually something like ""we are blocking jumps to the UI thread, unless you are this specific jump with a specific password, and then we let you through."" Or some custom way to control exactly what is ""let through"". If it doesn't have support we _can_ implement a very constrained system that might meet exactly our needs here (and not try to solve the general problem) which at least means we can barn-door-opening in the general case. In some sense this means we're reinventing JTF but rather than making a general-purpose thing the specific purpose thing can be more precisely targeted. Is this evil? maybe, but it might be an alternative solution worth looking at if we haven't already.

More generally, out-of-proc is on the horizon here; I don't know if there we'd start running everything OOP except for things marked as ""I need to be in-proc"", and if those run with JTF it's already clear they're doing evil and the evilness is already called out."
"My initial thought is no. While it's not useful to have both values, it's not technically wrong. DefaultSourceFileEncoding will always take precedence over FallbackSourceFileEncoding. From the pure perspective of EmitOptions it seems fine, even if the compiler implementation will never use both. "

"this is all wrong. Behaviors are meant to be declared in Styles, and have shared instances. So your behavior should keep track of an AssociatedObject, but an array of AssociatedObjects.

I'm guilty of this, I'm the one who made Behavior inherit from BindableObject"

That's not a super useful error, `ERROR_DIRECTORY` - I guess that makes sense, though not totally obvious what's wrong here. 

I'm okay with us leaving this for now. We do some validation of the `startingDirectory` on settings load, but nothing for directories passed as commandline args, and I think that's fine.

If we did want to try and pre-validate, we could pull `Profile::EvaluateStartingDirectory` into a helper, and only use the control's directory if it's valid. That's actually probably a good idea."

"I think the existing variable names are falling out of touch with what they mean as we start teasing apart trusted/untrusted builds. To encourage YAML reuse between the trusted and untrusted pipelines, we need this abstraction.

"Ok thank you for explaining.

Do you think it's ok if I remove that test and I instead add a more general test that checks if the scrolling is done correctly, but that no longer checks if the selection and renderer behavior works correctly (see 1508ff1895f94373f22b609a4ee5793f30c47dee)?

Here's why I personally think that it's better: instead of mocking the renderer to check if it received the right values, the test was relying on the fact that the function `_NotifyScrollEvent` was always called right after it sent the scroll delta to the renderer. So the test was relying on an implementation detail, and not actually checking if anything overflows (at least this is what I understand, I may be wrong).

The problem is that because I've changed some code, the assumption that the tests relied on is no longer valid so if I want to keep the test I probably have to refactor it and mock things and I don't think that it's worth it."
"This is wrong, because this means XI can't instantiate NSInputStream objects for Objective-C subclasses.

"`MarshalDirective` is a workaround we have to work around a calling convention limitation with P/Invokes.

The problem is that certain native types (such as `Vector3`) are not put in the normal registers when used as parameters to methods, instead they're passed in special SIMD registers. Unfortunately managed code (i.e. P/Invokes) doesn't know about this, so we can't call these native methods using P/Invokes because the arguments would be in the wrong registers.

Our workaround is a bit involved: we generate a native wrapper method where the parameters are passed in the expected registers, and that calls the actual native function, so that the native compiler puts the arguments in the right registers. The `MarshalDirective` attribute tells the generator that it should generate a call to the wrapper method instead of the normal P/Invoke (and that the name of the wrapper method is the name of the native function prefixed by `xamarin_simd__`, and the library where the wrapper method is located - `__Internal` means the executable itself)."

It is a wrong statement to classify CA analyzers as just .NET API analyzers. `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers` inserted into the SDK has two big analysis areas:

1. .NET API analyzers
2. Generic code-quality analyzers, which are API agnostic, code quality improvement analyzers.

`CA2242` falls into the second bucket. It has existed for close to a decade, starting in FxCop, then ported to FxCop analyzers and now .NET SDK analyzers. I don't see a good reason to deprecate this ID and move it to the compiler - it seems like lot of unnecessary work for no net gain. I am going to mark this PR as blocked until both the IDE team and compiler team are able to approve that we want to go the route of moving API agnostic CA analyzers into compiler layer."
"@github I found a bug in the old (current) implementation (outside my PR).
I tested this in a totally different environment
`NormalizeWhitespace` is adding a space between ""-"" and ""="" tokens in the remove accessor of the event.
Please note that this bug makes the program invalid, so it is pretty bad.

```
class f
{
    event w x;
    event w e
    {
        add
        {
            x += value;

        remove
        {
            x - = value;
        }
    }
}
```

"Ok, well I still don't quite get how this happens; since we get the same disassembly twice, and it's from the altjit (right?) so something is running the altjit twice -- it can't be that the base jit also reports disassembly as it would be different.

Since your fix works then I won't hold this up, but I think there's something else wrong here that would be nice to unearth."
"@github we’re having the same issue as @github, but I don’t understand your comment. Can you clarify what’s the difference between codebases with and without global files?

Previously we specified an array of files in the `files` property in `tsconfig`. But after getting rid of this array, the problem still persists and `assumeChangesOnlyAffectDirectDependencies` doesn’t seem to do anything, neither as a compiler option in `tsconfig`, nor as a CLI flag.

What could we be doing wrong?

Many thanks (and apologies if this is not the right place to ask)!"
"> The Function you mentioned will always get different size so there is no there choice. icmp6stats was working for years before breaking change. I could change that if that is consensus but I see that personally as unnecessary complication.

So, the thing here is that in fact, doing it the way it was being done (assuming a specific size, etc.) was *always* unsupported because it will *frequently* have breaking changes. It just was never given sufficiently strong warnings around making assumptions about sizes and locations. The recommended way has always been to use `sysctlbyname()` (which has a near-zero syscall penalty.) 

The actual reason for that requires hopping in your wayback machine and going back about 20 years. Basically, the concept of 'dynamic' sysctls (which may or may not exist) were introduced all the way back there, which shifted the recommendation to `sysctlbyname()` instead of statics on a global basis since `sysctlbyname()` can return `ENOENT` gracefully among other things. However, given it was 20 years ago, it wasn't really documented at all. And nobody ever went back and fixed the lack of documentation. They just got their fingers whacked with a ruler if they did it wrong.

So ultimately, doing it by static map or numeric *actually is the more complicated way* and technically 'the wrong way,' regardless of whether it's a single sysctl or a struct."
"> it now tightly couples the perf on one area to an implementation detail of another value and how it relates inheritance-wise to others

But perf *always* depends on implementation details of any external code and libraries you're using, because those implementation details affect the perf. In the next version of a library, the function you're using might be 2x slower (although realistically, that would usually be treated as a regression in corefx and it's unlikely to happen in the first place because they take perf of every area really seriously and have automated tests to detect any regressions). But still, when you're comparing 2 ways of doing something and you find that 1 of them is faster, in the next version, it could be the other one. So with perf, you're *always* relying on implementation details. That's why I tested this with multiple .NET versions.

Most importantly though, I'm not relying on implementation details with respect to correctness of behavior, only with respect to desirable perf outcomes.

> The cost is on maintainability. Anyone who has to maintain this now needs to hold all this complexity in their head and get things right on framework/core for any changes here in the future. That added complexity is more chance to get things wrong and to introduce subtle issues (like potential corruption).

I really don't see where the complexity or maintainability cost is. You're talking about this piece of code:
```c#
var @github = (TextWriterWriteReadOnlySpanDelegate)textWriter.Write;
if (@github.Method.DeclaringType != typeof(TextWriter))
{
    // Use the Write(ReadOnlySpan<char>) overload only if the method is overriden, because if it's not, the base
    // TextWriter implementation needs to delegate to the array overload and could potentially allocate a really
    // large array, which would be slower than the buffering base implementation.
    textWriter.Write(this.Source.AsSpan(span.Start, span.Length));
}
else
{
    base.Write(textWriter, span, cancellationToken);
}
```
That's literally just 1 condition - to check whether the `TextWriter` *supports* writing directly from a span, and 2 branches based on that, each do the same thing and both 1 line (or rather the second one calls an existing method). I really don't see where the cost is on maintainability. Both branches have the same behavior so if someone edits this someday and gets the condition wrong, it's not like the code will start behaving incorrectly or like there would be any corruption, as you're saying. It would just lose the perf benefit - that's literally it. The behavior would still be correct (and the tests also cover the behavior in both branches). And on top of that, this isn't the kind of method that has to evolve for new language features etc. This just copies a piece of data. This is the kind of code that is written once and usually stays the same because it doesn't need to evolve or change.

I'm kinda surprised by this. In dotnet/aspnetcore and especially dotnet/runtime, they routinely add all sorts of convoluted and hard to read code with many branches and different implementations to achieve perf benefits in any public API. This is really *nothing* compared to that. This is just one condition and 2 equally simple branches. I just don't see the complexity. I guess the recent perf enthusiasm in .NET hasn't reached Roslyn as much 😔

> Specifically, these types are already complex. To the point that it makes implementing language features harder

StringText.cs is currently 103 lines (without this PR). And as I mentioned, this isn't really the kind of code that has to evolve for new language features. This just copies a string.

>  I don't believe we do this elsewhere.

That doesn't mean it's complex though. 😳"
">I'm pretty sure there's some other stuff going on with like, turning parts of the value's type into the type in satisfies via contextual typing, most likely exclusively in cases that don't widen it. I might be wrong on that front though? That's stuff I don't really understand besides how to use it haha

That's pretty much exactly the stuff I'm asking about. 😄
Although in hindsight, my example was maybe a bit too simple to dig into it properly. 🤔"

"> it's fine - it's much better than introducing full on new syntax.

@github This is wrong, we're using the `assert` keyword for something that isn't an assertion. Why? You're correct that this is a type-only statement, all the more reason to do literally anything else and not misuse a JS syntax.

There are plenty of other options that make sense without _completely_ new and ts-only syntax e.g.
```ts
// comment directive, nothing new

// @github=require
import type { RequireInterface } from ""pkg"";
```
```ts
// https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-reflection

import type { RequireInterface } from ""pkg"" as ""resolution=require"";
```
```ts
// dangles off the already ts-only part

import type(resolution=require) { RequireInterface } from ""pkg"";
```

Please consider reverting this change."
"From a servicing perspective it's definitely better to dynamically load from the global install. But if these are scenarios where the dll is shipped with app anyway, then it doesn't matter.
There's also the ""how to acquire"" the .lib which is currently not very easy - so it also acts as a barrier for entry (it's much easier to get the .dll then the .lib).

The downside of not providing the header would be if people get it wrong in subtle ways... but I guess that's not that risky.

I'm fine either way."

We are implementing Hot Reload feature support during debug session in our debugger (https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg) for Tizen devices. We have Linux/Tizen arm32/arm64/amd64 devices with custom built runtime, that have `FEATURE_ENC_SUPPORTED` defined in order to make deltas apply debugger API part work.

During netcoredbg functional testing, I found, that for Linux arm32  `ICorDebugFunction2::GetVersionNumber` return wrong code version (it return `1` all times), but execute proper (updated by deltas) code in the same time.
This happens for `IcorDebugFunction` received from current frame, that received from provided by callback ICorDebugThread (`IcorDebugManagedCallback::Breakpoint`, `IcorDebugManagedCallback::StepComplete`, …).

I found, that point of issue for Linux arm32 is wrong `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` work, that not return proper `DebuggerJitInfo` (with proper method's code version), since can’t find it due to 
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/ecb4e6c178b98aec29fbf3e7a70a820240c1dd0b/src/coreclr/debug/ee/functioninfo.cpp#L1526
comparation, that all times produce `false`. In case no `DebuggerJitInfo` was found by `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo`, `1` version (initial code version) are used.

During investigation, I found that `m_addrOfCode` in `DebuggerJitInfo` have a THUMB code bit set unconditionally all the time:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/ecb4e6c178b98aec29fbf3e7a70a820240c1dd0b/src/coreclr/debug/ee/debugger.cpp#L2498-L2500
In the same time, `addrNativeStartAddr` THUMB code bit at `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` call is not defined and in case of our issue, have assertion and even unconditionally remove it from address (since this required by other code logic) before `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` (`DacDbiInterfaceImpl::LookupEnCVersions`-> `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` ) call:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/ecb4e6c178b98aec29fbf3e7a70a820240c1dd0b/src/coreclr/debug/daccess/dacdbiimpl.cpp#L1417-L1421

Looks like in `./src/coreclr/debug/ee/debugger.cpp` and `./src/coreclr/debug/ee/functioninfo.cpp` we calls `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` in proper way (with proper addresses in `addrNativeStartAddr` argument) and even have assertion about  THUMB code bit before call:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/ecb4e6c178b98aec29fbf3e7a70a820240c1dd0b/src/coreclr/debug/ee/functioninfo.cpp#L1593-L1594
but other sources call `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` without care about THUMB code bit. In this commit I propose fix `DebuggerMethodInfo::FindJitInfo` itself in order to care about THUMB code bit right before compare addresses.

I tested this changes with our debugger on Linux arm32 and can confirm, this fix arm32 issue in `ICorDebugFunction2::GetVersionNumber`.

Yes, you can have your own static files middleware and except for the case they are being mapped into the same subpath (or to ""/"") this should not interfere.

"Yeah, ""this is null only when some other local state says it will be"" and ""this isn't null when some other local state says it won't be"" are definitely big holes in the logic.

Effectively this type is a discriminated union; and assuming you read the typeID field you now know that the value can't be null.

Similarly with the cert.Get[Alg]PublicKey() methods... if you asked the ""what kind of thing is this"" you already know the nullarity.  We made them return null for the wrong algorithm for simpler flow control (and annoying cases like redundant identifiers)."

It could receive it by reference as well, except it has to be nullable. Or it could receive reference to `unique_ptr` but that's anti pattern in such situations (not to force implementation).

"@github @github I am pretty sure this is not what wee wamt longer term.

So the situation is when building natively on osx-arm64, we are currently using the osx-x64 dotnet core.  This means we are running msbuild in a Rosetta process.  When the shell is spawned, it apparently is also spawned in x64 shell. Here uname -m is returning `x64` or `amd64` and we get the wrong arch.  We get the rosetta arch and not the machine arch.

This hack allows CPUName as an environment variable to override `$(uname -m)`

We probably want a better environment variable if we want to go that way.

"Don't think the `MemoryBarrier` will provide that. The barrier controls read / write reordering from within a thread. It doesn't do anything to guarantee the synchronization of writes from other threads for this thread. 

Stated another way. Lets say Thread 1 is the one which enters the `if (managedKind ==)` above and T2 skips the if and goes straight to this line. In T1 the order of writes is indeed `_managedKindUseSiteDiagnostics` and then `_flags`. That does not mean the order in which the writes become visible to T2 is the same. The order in which the writes become visible could be `_flags` then `_managedKindUseSiteDiagnostics`. The `MemoryBarrier` doesn't help here because all it does is control the order of read / writes within T2. It doesn't control whether or not those reads are consistent with the writse from T1. 

It's possible I'm remembering part of this wrong but pretty much whenever u have to depend on the ordering of writes between threads there is usually this type of gap.

3. Also found another ""bug?"" where if you select empty text while copy on select is enabled, we end up copying literally nothing. I'm guessing this is because we switched the default `copy()` behavior to trimming whitespace. Should that be a part of this PR?

That partially answers my question about the best way to make the code fix. But is it really desirable to replace this error message?

Should we try to also preserve the ""not callable"" error (the actual ""root cause""), or do you really think it's best to replace it?"
">> Just add #nullable disable at the top of the test file.

> Sounds overkill,

Quite the opposite. In my opinion, using nullable analysis in tests is an overkill. It simply introduces unnecessary overhead on every angle. A test doesn't have to handle every possible scenario. If it doesn't fail, there is nothing to get wrong about nullability, it is focused on a very specific scenario.

"> If we're going to do anything here (and I don't think it's a particularly high yield scenario) we should add additional logic to `getIntersectionType` that reduces intersections of array types and tuple types

This was my first thought as well, but I noticed that dealing with unreduced intersections of arrays and tuples works totally as expected, from an assignability perspective. It’s only during the normalization into another tuple (specifically this last condition where it’s assumed that anything that reaches this branch can just become a rest element of the index type) that things go awry—so while eagerly reducing more intersections would prevent that, it seemed like unnecessary work to me. And while I agree that this is a strange edge case, there are examples that are weird and wrong enough that I thought fixing it would be worthwhile if it didn’t come at the cost of performance (which I need to check). But I guess my test cases didn’t show the worst manifestations of the bug:

```ts
type Intersection = number[] & [""a"", 2, 3];
type Normalized = [...Intersection]; // (3 | 2)[]
```

We can reason that `Intersection` ought to be `never`, and although it does not immediately reduce, the only types that are assignable to it are `never` and 3-length tuples where at least the zeroth element is `never`, which are arguably as good as `never`. And of course, `Intersection` is assignable both to `number[]` and to `[""a"", 2, 3]`. I have no problem with `Intersection` in its non-reduced form.

But after spreading into another tuple, it becomes `(3 | 2)[]`. This breaks the identity that I _think_ should hold, that `[...T]` is equivalent to `T` for any array-like `T`, because `(3 | 2)[]` is not assignable to `[""a"", 2, 3]`. So I’m not sure I see why eager intersection reductions would be necessary when no assignability problems are observable until tuple normalization happens."
"Also

> Does it matter that isDefinition may be wrong in a way that has no effect on CodeLens, the only consumer?

When you find-all-refs on a declaration of a symbol that has only 1 non-declaration reference, both VS Code and emacs jump to that lone non-declaration. I think that code must rely on isDefinition too&mdash;at least the emacs code did when I first wrote it in 2016.

In this case, making imports have `isDefinition: true` would mean that find-all-ref would not jump to a single import, but display the usual find-all-refs UI. I think this is fine."
"> superpmi seems to be failing with JIT failed to initialize

superpmi.py has an algorithm for determining the baseline JIT to download from the JIT rolling build and use, but it's fragile as it depends on your branch being branched from a local 'main' branch, so it might be wrong, and in this case, it's probably picked a baseline JIT from before the last JIT/EE GUID change. You can build/download and specify your own baseline, using the `-base_jit_path` argument to `superpmi.py asmdiffs`"
"@github reordering them would certainly be a better choice, but it isn't trivial for me, as I'm no expert in the details of how the JIT really works. As the reverse p/invoke is added to the prolog/epilog in the flowgraph stage, and the inlined call frame logic is handled during lower; however, I'm not comfortable making such a change myself, as the fix looked to be more involved than I was prepared to handle, and prolog/epilog code is notoriously fussy to get right. That said, if this gets checked in in the current state, I'll open an issue against the JIT team to look at coming up with the more optimal fix. I've been able to get this to reproduce reliably by running the determinism test in a loop under jitstress1 mode, so verifying a more complex fix is not a difficult task.

@github Rare is possibly the wrong word.... possibly, less common would be a better term.

The other nice thing about subsets is that it is simple enough to figure out all the available subsets as they are right there for you as part of the help of the build.cmd/sh command. Why do we prefer two different mechanisms to filter out projects? (Subsets and properties like RefOnly)

I think one of the main goals we should have with these kinds of changes, is to try to minimize the impact as much as possible to developers existing workflows and by removing subsets (which are likely being used by a lot of devs) we are very likely breaking their workflow.

"Confirming my understanding:

When the editor has encountered what it and the language consider to be a ""potential commit character"", it lets us know that we should try to commit it.

There are two main exception cases where we do not commit, both of which are due to the chosen completion item having special, non-standard rules about filtering/committing.
1. The chosen item has explicitly declared that the typed character is to be used for _filtering_. That is, the character enters the buffer but the original completion session keeps running.
2. The chosen item has explicitly declared that the typed character is *not* to be used for committing. 

We check the above exception cases in order, so exception 2 actually means that the original completion session should be immediately halted. Then, the problem was that when halted after a `.`, that `.` was then not being considered as a trigger character for the next session because we were halting the wrong way.

---

So more to this PR, if `CommitBehavior.Cancel` is returned, that's our way of communicating that we actually know something the editor doesn't, and the completion session should continue on (the case of additional filter characters).

Then, every `CommitBehavior` _except_ `Cancel` means we are, in fact, ""doing"" the commit. There are three ways to mark it as such, one of which is `CommitBehavior.None`, and the other two non-`Cancel` commit behaviors that just tell the editor whether to handle TypeChar/Tab/Return non-standardly. In all 3 of these cases, the session is completed **and a new session is free to start if a trigger character had been typed**. This is why changing `Cancel` to `None` has the desired effect

What is the point to seal it? This actually removes it from the list of valid override candidates in completion list. Making it very easy to miss to override the API properly. It is fine to provide default implementation in this type, but I think we shouldn't be sealing any of them simply because it sends the wrong message and likely to lead to an oversight when derived types are implemented.

But this isn't really surprising anyways: As usual C++ continues to not have any rules forbidding aliasing non-const references, which sucks 🍑. Meaning: Every time (if on MSVC without strict aliasing support) or almost every time (with strict aliasing) you dereference a value in C++ you fetch it's value from memory, because the compiler can't prove you didn't change it as a side-effect somewhere else.

Alas, that means it's case sensitive. Hopefully that won't break anything.

I had this PR some time ago and will need to finish it soon and it's in the same area.
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/64845

I need to be able to convert C# `long` into JS `number` as part of the new marshaling.
But I need it to use all 52 integral bits of the underlying double. `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`
Beyond that range, it should round to next possible integer, and not go crazy by setting exponent bits.

My naïve implementation uses BigInt to do the conversion, but it allocates object. 
So I want to improve and use math+shifts instead.

Your `CUInt64` is also expensive by allocating array.  
I wonder if we could use 'Number' and it's 64 bits to store the bits and only do some math when we need full sized BigInt.
But that would be different math than in my use case, because we would store different bits.
And different math to get `Number`.

Much of the complexity of mine is coming from the fact that we don't always have all the transitive map is often incomplete: prior to my change, we compute that project-at-a-time. In your pseudocode, you would need additional checking that transitiveReferences might not have that entry, and if so then you have to preserve that. I could alternately choose to investigate that further, but at this point I feel we're entering bikeshedding territory.

Your code is also missing one important point: you're only propagating the new direct references. If A -> B and C -> D, and I'm adding B -> C, then you need to get D added too. My first loop computes you need to include D, also accounting for the fact we might not know C's transitive references and thus instead need to propagate ""we don't know""."

I'm wrong/wasn't interpreting things correctly.  They *are* being used.

I am thus *further* confused by `Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat.exe`.

Background: API-R adds [`CellInfo.getCellIdentity()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/CellInfo#getCellIdentity()), and [`CellInfoCdma.getCellIdentity()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/CellInfoCdma#getCellIdentity()) overrides it.

These do *not* have the same return type:

```java
public class CellInfo {
    public CellIdentity getCellIdentity();
}
public class CellInfoCdma extends CellInfo {
    public CellIdentityCdma getCellIdentity();
}
```

This is fine in Java because of covariant return types.  This *isn't* fine in C#, which is why we have those `metadata` rules so that `CellInfoCdma.CellIdentity` has the same property type as `CellInfo.CellIdentity`.

This in turn means that the property types changed, which is a compatibility break:

API-29:

```csharp
namespace Android.Telephony {
	public sealed partial class CellInfoCdma : Android.Telephony.CellInfo, Android.OS.IParcelable {
		public unsafe Android.Telephony.CellIdentityCdma CellIdentity {
...
	}
}
```

API-R:

```csharp
namespace Android.Telephony {
	public sealed partial class CellInfoCdma : Android.Telephony.CellInfo, Android.OS.IParcelable {
		public unsafe Android.Telephony.CellIdentity CellIdentity {
...
	}
}
```

In a One Mono.Android.dll World Order...I'm not sure how we actually support this.  We'll need to figure that out later.

In the meantime, we have a property type change between API-29/v10.0 and API-R/v10.0.99!  This is *clearly* a compatibility break!

...and it's exactly *this* type change which the `metadata` rules were performing.  Consequently the `managedReturn`s *are* being used.

Yet `Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat.exe` doesn't even mention this breakage:

https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/1a6fcff8a5a68bc2b53afa948176dea9681ff0d0/tests/api-compatibility/acceptable-breakages-v10.0.99.txt

Unfortunately that is what actually happens: [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgxg9gTgpgtADwGwBYA0AXEBDAzgWwB8ABAJgEYBYAKGIGYACY8pJ0hgYQYG8aH+mjZqwBKMbABMA8gDsANgE8AygAdsMgDxgAFtigA+BgFlyACgCUDALyGARBhgIMtgNx8B9Jiy8AGY6QtrOwcnVxoAXyA===) (same indirect pointer is used for both methods)

Ideally the ROS would point directly to the string data from the binary, without materializing the string at all.

By this do you mean a single Project (one project in a solution of projects) can have up to 1 one package.json for each source directory under it's root? So the worst case scenario would be one package.json per source file?

Or is only one recognized package.json allowed per project?

I had thought it was 1 recognized per project (always adjacent to or above the project tsconfig), but I am aware I could be wrong.

IF it is only one package.json per project, then using the hash of the stringified collection of relevant properties would result in minimal impact on tsbuildinfo size."

In general I want it to be possible for the runtime to start sending an inline manifest for providers that we did not send a manifest for in the past. If the inline manifest currently being sent is wrong I understand not sending it until those issues can be corrected. Can you add more detail to this issue about what is problematic with the current manifest EventSource sends?"

> > It's also designed to be (partially) AOT friendly by making the core icall not generic.

At one point we had an invoke icall with a generic ```<T>``` return type, but that can't be AOTed (at least right now). So the current one returns object, which is inefficient (and kind of gross in terms of the burden it puts on both the caller and callee). We want strong types both for reliability and small, efficient codegen.

> 
> Also what's wrong with the existing `mono_wasm_invoke_js` ? (besides that it should not have `eval` and live in `EM_ASM_INT` macro, which I both fixed in my pending [PR](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/60504/files#diff-aeaa65b0a5528aaf1d5f89c138410cd639839359113f9c6a700efe2f9cf0e2caR479) .)

I could sit down and try to carefully enumerate why I think we need a new icall, but off the top of my head (this was a long design discussion that happened quite a while ago, so it's reasonable to revisit it):
* ```mono_wasm_invoke_js_with_args``` is not a tasteful API - the design does not have the traits of a good maintainable API. During the review for custom marshalers some of the same traits (weak types, boxing etc) that came up there as no-go apply to it as well.
* It's hard to optimize without compatibility breaks (for example, requiring that the method name be interned), and it's easy to hit performance pitfalls by using it in an inefficient way. Taking an object[] arg basically guarantees bad performance (the only real way to optimize the allocation out requires a ThreadLocal to be safe.)
* Many JS functions return undefined, and I think it's inappropriate to silently convert that to a null - it often indicates that you misunderstand the signature of the function you're calling and should be a failure.
* JS functions also happily accept extra arguments and sometimes will work if arguments are missing. This API makes it easy to do that, and I think we should be explicit about argument count. (The current icall doesn't enforce a callee argument count check... I could add that on the JS side if you want but I think there are cases where the callee won't have argument count data.)
* Aside from the general 'hard to optimize' problem I think making every single invoke create GC pressure is a very bad thing. We need to avoid it in the bindings.
* This new icall's signature is basically a cleaned up variation on ```mono_wasm_invoke_js_blazor``` (with the exception that the callee+caller need to collaborate to handle exceptions). I think it's best to ensure our API can efficiently be used to implement blazor, uno, etc.
* For ```mono_wasm_invoke_js```, the overhead of looking up the string literal is nonzero (especially because it's not required to be interned), and not being able to pass arguments requires the caller to do unclean things like shove arguments into globals (which is not a cheap thing to do via the current API... you'd have to do SetObjectProperty per-argument.)

My endgame for this is that we use source generators to create strongly-typed wrappers for specific methods (JS pinvoke, basically) that correctly and efficiently use this new icall under the hood. Later on those wrappers could transition to using dedicated JS and bypassing the icall machinery if necessary."
"Or actually I did something wrong, let me check..."
"@github Been deeply looking at `218913`:

With this PR, it creates a CSE for a double constant:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1278959/177669257-4c9e9bbd-db2b-4463-9ffc-7711d3dbf3ec.png)

But because constant propagation does not happen for CSEs, constant folding does not occur and an assertion prop for `OAK_EQUAL` gets missed.

I did some tinkering with assertion prop where I could get it to recognize that the cse variable represents a constant but I don't know if we want to do that. I didn't get a lot of diffs, though it would fix this regression when combined with this PR.

But, this is part of `coreclr_tests` which does crazy things; I probably wouldn't go further than we already have."
"@github definitely relevant - we can still change stuff here until the release.

> One reason to bubble up all exceptions (if at all possible) is that developers need to be alerted of problems. Like, if there is network flakiness or some server issue, it needs to show up in error reporting. Yes, it might not make a difference during normal execution but there is still something wrong if Close fails.

Right, and that's why these problems are logged - non-critical issues which don't hinder successful execution don't necessarily have to be raised as exceptions, which interrupt the actual user experience (e.g. fail a web request although the database operation did execute successfully).

A good comparison here is what happens when calling DbConnection.Dispose; it's supposed to close an open connection, but Dispose isn't supposed to surface any errors (in general in .NET).

"Just when you think ""iOS has no padding, so it will be easy"", Apple throws you a curve ball - or a rotten apple if you like. When you set padding to 0, iOS decides that you are wrong and will use the 0 for the left/right padding, but a 6 or 8 padding for top or bottom. So, to avoid this, we have to set a ""almost zero"" padding for the top/bottom.

But no worries, iOS does not respect this fraction as it seems to trim the value. So, not only can you not set 0, but it also doesn't respect half the non-zero values! "

"> * Double-click word selection seems to treat the click and expansion coordinates as _buffer_ instead of _screen_ (resulting in the wrong range being selected)

I thought I might miss a few of these operations. But that should be an easy one to fix. I think it just needs a couple of `ScreenToBuffer` and `BufferToScreen` calls in the `SCREEN_INFORMATION::GetWordBoundary` method.

> * I encountered a crash resizing the console down (horizontally) after putting a normally double-width glyph into a double-width line²

Oof. That's bad. Thanks for catching that. It looks like the `TextBuffer::_GetPreviousFromCursor` method needs to be adjusted to take the current line width into account rather than assuming the full buffer width. If that's all it is, that should be an easy fix too.

> where the setting belongs (which level)

I think this makes sense as a global. It's next to `copyOnSelect`, so the user can expect a consistent selection interaction across all of their sessions.

> naming

`trimBlockSelection`: `<bool>`

I actually _really_ like this name. It's short. It's clear that it _only_ impacts block selection.

My only complaint could be that the trimming only happens when we copy, not when we select. But I think that's me just grasping at straws to find something wrong with it haha. And I honestly think people won't think of the setting in that way; docs, the schema description, and the SUI header should be more than enough to remove that ambiguity.

> phrasing, etc.

""Remove trailing white-spaces when copying text in rectangular selection to clipboard""

Maybe change ""rectangular"" to ""block"". I'm mildly irritated by how long it is, but I'd rather see it be descriptive than not. And I think this is ok to be ""negative"", because ""Keep trailing white-spaces..."" isn't clear that the alternative is to remove them. But yeah, definitely want more input on this one.

### Miscellaneous design thoughts

We _could_ change this setting to `trimCopiedText`, but I _really_ don't like that because I like that we're already handling trimming text pretty smart. Line selection doesn't trim, whereas block selection is up to the user. From [this comment](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/9706#issuecomment-814032515), it seems like there's already consensus on block selection being configurable in this way so this seems like a solid win for me."

"> it has DocumentResetAsync but unfortunately I can't use it since it is async method. for now, I need to stick with RemoveDocument.

Note: because you are clearing the data associate for the workspace, the methods you call should not be document-centric.  They should be workspace-centric.  Otherwise we have the wrong level of granularity, and it's totally possible for an analyzer to be caching data that won't get removed.

## 

Note: this is not a hypothetical.  This is how one of our incremental analyzers works today. SymbolTreeIncrementalAnalyzer has this code:

``` c#
            public override Task AnalyzeDocumentAsync(Document document, SyntaxNode bodyOpt, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
            {
                if (!document.SupportsSyntaxTree)
                {
                    // Not a language we can produce indices for (i.e. TypeScript).  Bail immediately.
                    return SpecializedTasks.EmptyTask;
                }

                if (bodyOpt != null)
                {
                    // This was a method level edit.  This can't change the symbol tree info
                    // for this project.  Bail immediately.
                    return SpecializedTasks.EmptyTask;
                }

                return UpdateSymbolTreeInfoAsync(document.Project, cancellationToken);
            }
```

Note that at hte bottom, we do our processing on the _Project_ of the document and we cache that data at the project level.

""RemoveDocument"" isn't even implemented by this class, so no cleanup happens at all.

## 

Now, i have no idea if this is a problem or not.  But it seems _really_ fishy that we're just calling ""RemoveDocument"" and we're expecting that to be sufficient.

We have a gap with what we can express currently and a better plan is to use the analyzers/linker knowledge to fill it. I don't like the linker specific solution because there are other libraries that will have the same problem I wouldn't recommend they do what this PR does, it's just not right."

"> Are we worried we can overflow `int`? I can bump count to `long` or `ulong`. This is no longer ""the answer"" but more so the upper guess. The actual answer comes from walking the structures and counting entries we like.

It's not the underflow or the overflow, but the internal behavioral changes that are the concern. It was specifically implemented to improve portability between 32/64-bit architectures, and ultimately is an `int64_t`, but is an ABI breaking change as well. Basically the intent was to make `xinpcb` structs word-size independent. Meaning they could go down or up from an `int` and a consumer wouldn't need to handle that portion, it can just rely on the kernel to manage it.
As it currently sits, FreeBSD could overflow `int` as `kvaddr_t` is a `uint64_t`.

Relevant commit is [here](https://reviews.freebsd.org/rS335979#change-CaAchZVQnKNx) in FreeBSD, names changed and I kept forgetting about it. 
```c
struct xinpcb {
	ksize_t		xi_len;			/* length of this structure */
...
	union {
		kvaddr_t inp_ppcb;		/* (s) netstat(1) */
		int64_t	ph_ppcb;
	};
```

That said, the way netstat handles it looks to be probably the right way.
`char mibvar[sizeof ""net.local.seqpacket.pcblist""];` where `mibvar` is a switch around TCP/UDP/SCTP/raw. Then it does a walk of the pcb list in `pcblist_kvm()`. That appears to be the most correct way for both OSX and FreeBSD, but I could definitely be wrong about OSX."

CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies shouldn't be relevent for design-time build.  This is only for full-build about whether it decides to copy the libs from nuget packages.

> I thought that `iconv-lite` through webpack would support all encodings because there are no native dependencies, but please correct me if that assumption was wrong.

Your assumption is correct. It's not about native dependencies, it's about `iconv-lite` relying on the fact that it gets `Buffer` as input and not `Uint8Array`. The solution is very straightforward - adding `Buffer.from` in couple places. So in the worst case scenario we can always go with a fork.

According to the release notes this issue is fixed in 4.8.0.1269 (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/release-notes/4.8/4.8.0-pre3#issues-fixed) - which is a wrong information: the issue is still reproducible in this version. By updating Xamarin.Forms to 4.8.0.1687 we could confirm that this bug is fixed.
"Yes, that's intended. This is the one deliberate odd behaviour. When the folding provider no longer returns a region which it previously returned and which is collapsed the foldingModel logic can't easily distinguish between three possible reasons:
1. The user modified the text in such a way that the region really is gone. E.g. They deleted the opening ""{"" of a region. In this case we should unfold it.
2. The user modified the text such that the region is now embedded in a comment or a string. In this case it makes sense to keep the region folded - the user may next close the comment or string before the region. And even if they don't the fold still makes a kind of sense.
3. The folding range provider is misbehaving. Very slow to respond or responding incorrectly. Which we think is the case in the issue which got this whole thing going. In this case we want the hidden region(s) to stay hidden.

Since the foldingModel can't readily distinguish between these cases I decided to treat it as case (1) if only one hidden region is affected and unfold it, and treat it as case (2) or (3) if more than one hidden region is affected. My reasoning is that even if it is wrong in treating a situation as the first case, as it is in your example, only one fold is affected and that isn't a big hardship to the user. I expect it will nearly never be wrong when treating something the other way."
"The existing wrong block comment gets replaced by the new text template in single line comment style. The only difference is, that before the fixer added the new header, while it now replaces the header. The test name does not say anything about the replacement behavior, so it is still fine.

Should we be using `CondinueOnError` here? Just in case something horrible goes wrong... If this task errors when the entire build will stop.
"> Do we want to handle that case?

I think it's good to handle casts on conditional expressions, but if it proves more expensive/fraught, it might be necessary to drop it.

> And if we do, I'm not sure we need to have a concept of an ""acceptable"" conversion. Either there was an error during initial binding, or the result of the conversion can be nullable.

I didn't understand this part. It feels like what's important about the conversion is:

- If the conversion only gives non-null output when the input is non-null, we can propagate out the StateWhenNotNull (most built-in conversions meet this requirement).
- Otherwise, we don't know why the conversion result is non-null, and we have to discard the StateWhenNotNull of the inner conditional access.

> This doesn't look correct. I don't believe we should be walking through conversions here at all: the conversion that needs to be applied in in BoundNullCoalescingOperator.LeftConversion.

So I decided to report it upstream: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Note-that-follows-warning-C4477-is-inacc/1691095?space=62&q=inaccurate. The VCR team thinks the suggestion is correct and  clang/gcc are wrong about error. IMO, cl.exe is wrong; if we want printer to use signed data we can `ssize_t` cast the variable and use `%zd` but the format specifier should only correspond to the data type in use and produce suggestion accordingly. I tried. 🤷

However, using `%zu` make both worlds happy. cl.exe only _suggests_ %zd, but it is fine with %zu (i.e. C4477 goes away 🙏)."
"In any case, my original example, `x < this.property`, is wrong -- it *does* suggest `this`. It just doesn't when the identifier to the left of `<` is a generic signature. 

So I think making `this` and `typeof` type keywords is best fixed in a separate PR, since it requires more knowledge of services than I have now, and only affects things that are genuinely type contexts. I filed a bug #32486 to track it."
"Actually, I’m not sure. If I change this line to property access (`x.someProperty = 3`), it still wants `isDefinition: true`. It might be wrong, but it appears to be consistently wrong, and probably nothing to do with my changes here..."

And we actually have a bug here, because this currently does not work. Fails with ""constructor not available"" :-/  
It almost works, but something goes wrong with constructor lookup.

"> I had the impression that forceConsistentFileNames ignored drive roots. Sorry for not including a comment to that effect.

Yes. But your import doesnt test import ""somethingsomething/a"" and  ""somethingsomething/A"" you would get error on either one of those and that was expected behavior which is not the current case.

> I'm not sure I follow. Where is the current directory specified in this case?

Current directory need to be specified as part of the https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/41292/files#diff-742ed890d46f805d54cbcf33f4a6f2cd286a81ac5df890b0b20636445b464093R149 . We need test where current directory differs in casing from whats on the disk.

The bigger missing part is import in wrong casing should give error which it wont because the realpath will resolve to casing on the disk and then we will loose that info. But same code in case sensitive file system will give error because import will not be resolved.

Disk file name: a.ts 

import ""a"" > success
import ""A"" > will fail on case sensistive file systems... so it should error with forceConsistentFileCasing on case insensitive filesystem which it would not when realpath is invoked as part of this change."
not being able to reference ref-struct-locals from local-funcs sucks.  @github  can we fix this in the language :D
"Thanks for the update.  I just took a look at my tests (including the original tests in the repo) to double check that they all passed after the change (they did), and I realized that that I had forgotten the System.Data.OleDb library uses the text/csv format for its tests, not the accdb format.  I apologize for probably sounding like a crazy person before when I was talking about .laccdb files and what not.

The only way I could observe bugs from the changed transaction code was to write my own tests, and to do so, I used the driver with an accdb file (since this is my intended scenario).  I assume using the driver with text/csv will have a similar issue due to not being disposed properly, but it could be that there are two different bugs.  Hopefully, that's not the case, but it is a possibility."
"It would be good to add tests that demonstrate that this can cause an error. Something like this, which I don't believe would have errored before:

``` ts
function foo({ a = 0 } = {}) { }
foo({ a: """" });
```

Basically something where the property was dropped in the initializer, but then was present again in the argument with the wrong type.
"
"The problem is we do not know if the file exist but wrong extension or that it does not. may be we should add some elaboration to the error message. i would log a separate issue for it.
"
"This is wrong
"
"Yes, here’s the situation as I think it is occurring:

* A non-UI thread is is loading projects into the project collection. This thread acquires the read lock on the project collection.
* On the UI thread, a project finishes loading and is finalized. This fires OnAfterCreateProject which tries to get the output path of the finalized project. This causes the current project configuration to be created, which tries to set the Platform property on the project. This requires the write lock on the project collection, which it can’t have yet due to the outstanding read lock. So it blocks and pushes a message loop to pump messages while it waits.
* There is yet another non-UI thread initializing Roslyn with information from the evaluation (since the design-time build has not been run yet). This sets the compiler options for Roslyn, which calls AbstractLegacyProject.RefreshBinOutputPath. This uses IVsBuildPropertyStorage::GetValueProperty, which is bound to the UI thread. So the call is marshalled to the UI thread where we try and read a property from the project, which means we need to acquire a read lock. Since someone is waiting for the write lock, we block on the read lock, waiting for the thread requesting the write lock to complete. Unfortunately, since that is the UI thread, we deadlock.
 
Reading the comments from the code, I believed that initializing Roslyn on the background thread with just evaluation data was safe because Roslyn wouldn’t in that case call IVsBuildPropertyStorage, but obviously that belief was wrong. I thought maybe there was something different about VB, but it looks like C# does the same thing, so IDK where my belief came from.

I don't think that queueing the update to the UI thread will help, unless I'm misunderstanding the situation, because the UI thread is free in this case and the problem is the read lock being piled on top of the write lock.

This is a 16.8 bug because it causes hangs in optprof. If you're worried about other downstream issues, we could back off the background initialization of Roslyn for the time being on the project system side, which would be fine. Just let me know what you think, you're the expert here. :)"
"@github This simple approach expands `syntaxTree.IsTypeContext`, to also be true in `syntaxTree.IsLocalFunctionDeclarationContext`. The only test that fails with this addition is the `delegate` keyword recommender (test failure: `delegate` is suggested after `static`):

https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/6453b4f67c612dd68fb486d56a39eac88545e340/src/EditorFeatures/CSharpTest2/Recommendations/DelegateKeywordRecommenderTests.cs#L289-L291

The root cause is here in `ValidTypeContext`:
https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/6453b4f67c612dd68fb486d56a39eac88545e340/src/Features/CSharp/Portable/Completion/KeywordRecommenders/DelegateKeywordRecommender.cs#L31-L47

I'm not too confident about the `delegate` keyword, but to me, it feels like it should *not* be suggested in a type context. For instance, it is suggested in method parameters (`void M($$`), which I think is wrong. @github It probably should read `context.IsTypeDeclarationContext` in line 44?

@github What do you think about the approach of expanding `syntaxTree.IsTypeContext`? What should we do about the `DelegateKeywordRecommender`."
"Rough gist: the module names are wrong, not the import

Chatted with @github  - when you have commonjs set as the target, you basically never want a .d.ts which would look like this - the core issue is in the declared module names (nothing in the generated .d.ts here is portable) without either:

 - requiring code like `/// <amd-module-name name=""thing"" />` in some/all files
 - knowing the package for the package name and adding it to the module names:

```ts
declare module ""packagename/nested/shared"" {
    export class B {
    }
}
declare module ""packagename/nested/base"" {
    import { B } from ""packagename/nested/shared"";
    export function f(): B;
}
declare module ""packagename/nested/derived"" {
    export function g(): import(""packagename/nested"").B;
}
declare module ""packagename/nested"" {
    export * from ""packagename/nested/base"";
    export * from ""packagename/nested/derived"";
    export * from ""packagename/nested/shared"";
}
declare module ""packagename"" {
    export * from ""packagename/nested"";
}
```

Which could come from a compiler option. (an implicit look up wouldn't work in all cases) - Wes feels this is worth it.

"The costs you highlight for GetEnvironmentVariable are because the runtime reads and stores the UTF8 env vars on first use,  and then calls to GetEnvironmentVariable need to transcode the UTF16 key being searched for, which is done linearly.  To make GetEnvironmentVariable faster in microbenchmarks, the runtime could instead pre-transcode them all and potentially store them in a hashtable. The problem, though, is trying to optimize for microbenchmarks on the throughput of GetEnvironmentVariable will likely lead you to do the ""wrong"" thing.  No one should be calling GetEnvironmentVariable on a hot path; instead, while there are exceptions to this, it's generally used once for a given key, often during startup / first use of some code that checks it for configuration info and then never looks at it again; in my experience,  there are also generally many more environment variables in the environment than the app actually cares about. We could spend way more time transcoding all env vars, find we made a benchmark.net test of GetEnvironmentVariable much faster, but actually slowed down the overall startup of an app with no measurable reward to show for it. If you'd like to prototype that and can demonstrate it does help with the overall startup of various app types (e.g. because it turns out we end up looking for lots of environment variables, maybe multiple times, or because we have to transcode them all anyway for an inevitable call to GetEnvironmentVariables, plural), then we could certainly consider that direction. It would make multiple calls to GetEnvironmentVariables faster as well. 

(It's also possible there are some simpler, smaller optimizations possible. For example, if the vast majority of keys are ASCII, maybe there could be a fast-path that skips the transcoding initially and tries to do the comparison between the byte and char unless a non-ASCII value is hit.)"
"There's a conflict from there being two kinds of errors that typically get suppressed: code quality and type checking.

Code quality errors are produced by settings like `noUnusedLocals`. These errors don't always mean that your code is wrong so suppressing them can be justified since they don't affect the correctness of your program. Adding ranged suppressions can be useful in case there are many errors, as in @github's use case.

Type errors are different. Ignoring these errors isn't a magic ""make my code work"" button. Ignoring them can have unintended consequences on how the rest of your code is checked. They should never be ignored unless there's absolutely no other way of getting around the problem (and I've never seen an example of this). There's no valid use case for range suppressions of type checking errors; we should encourage people to fix their types and not ignore errors.

This dilemma should be resolved in favour of not adding ranged suppressions. The TSC diagnostics system is basically unconfigurable and it's impossible to ignore specific kinds of errors (which is fine for type checking but less for linting). If you need more control over code quality diagnostics than what TSC provides you can use something like ESLint."

What kind of using you're talking about? The error was in the ref file, I've never saw usings in it 😄 
I tried to add

and
`error NU1201: Project System.Runtime is not compatible with net461 (.NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1). Project System.Runtime supports: net6.0 (.NETCoreApp,Version=v6.0)`

So I assume it's not possible to use this attribute here yet (correct me if I'm wrong) and simply revert changes"
"> @github it appears hotreload-utils build tool is expecting a new sdk since it picked up the update from darc

That sounds wrong. Repositories which produce tools that we depend on shouldn't update their SDK at a faster cadence than us. If we wouldn't need to update to a newer SDK right now in dotnet/runtime, we would be blocked for 1-2 months until we would update to the officially released RC1 SDK. Am I missing something here? If not we should probably establish guidance across repositories."

According to the previous live var ranges, `this` is in `rcx` in the entire `G_M54305_IG06` group, which looks wrong. After the change we report the stack home which seems better."

Disposes connection in a separate task to not to block the scavenging timer callback on the stream close.
Guards scavenging timer callback from parallel execution.

Fixes #61505 and #61506

I plan to validate the fix with the customer before merging. But I'd like to know if the way I solved this is not completely wrong or too different from what you had in mind? @github @github

"1-byte default for bool is likely wrong more than 50% of the time and it will have to be overridden most of the time. Given that, I think it would be better to make the marshaling directive for bool mandatory.

It matches the approach that we took with string marshaling. There is no great default for string marshaling and so we require it to be always specified explicitly.  "
"I looked most everything over just to familiarize myself with the changes (except morph). Will go back through in more detail tomorrow and write up some specific feedback.

Overall I agree this looks like a very nice cleanup.

Seems like we use the ""enumerate early args then late args"" pattern quite often, I wonder if some sort of combined iterator makes sense.

Also wonder if we can come up with some kind of safeguards to make it harder to look at the wrong enumerations. Or maybe find better descriptive names?"
"The single diff is due to a new CSE which happens due to us using wrong handle types in `impTokenToHandle` when `importParent` is true. We have two `CORINFO_HELP_NEWSFAST` calls with the same handles except one of them is marked as a method instead of token, and after some arithmetic we can now CSE them.

I am fixing the `impTokenToHandle` problem as part of #70437."
"Generally the user manager does all of the validations, errors at the store level are usually something going really wrong, like you mucked with the schema, or for this bug, you have duplicate emails in your db and try to use it like a key"
You don't need include and exclude patterns. The reason is that anything that is not included will be already excluded. Am I wrong?
"I think that the behavior here is wrong, we should fix it, and make an announcement if necessary."
I'm assuming there's no use case for exiting the debugging state within a given browser tab. If that's wrong then I guess we'd need more logic to delete the `sessionStorage` entry if it's becoming false.
">rewrittenArguments = factory.MakeTempsForDiscardArguments(rewrittenArguments, temporariesBuilder); [](start = 16, length = 98)

>rewrittenArguments = factory.MakeTempsForDiscardArguments(rewrittenArguments, temporariesBuilder); [](start = 16, length = 98)

I believe this is a wrong place for this operation, it should be performed before the ""__arglist"" check (see [https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/19382](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/19382)). I understand that this is preexisting problem, but I suggest to move this code out of this function, into MakeArguments right before this function is called. This will make the code cleaner because we will be able to get rid of the ```factory``` and ```temporariesBuilder``` parameters, and the conditional logic associated with them.

"> The version of Microsoft.NET.Compilers.Toolset that's shipping as part of the the SDK is 3.8.0-5.20570.14

That was true at 5.0 RTM but has changed with every bug fix we take to the compiler. There have been two such fixes since RTM. We should make sure we understand how this process works to ensure Razor has the Roslyn bits it's expected to be getting. Think that can be a follow up discussion though. 

> Both of these get the compiler version through a single project / package reference:

This is still where I'm stuck. If they both get their version from a single project reference then how did they get out of sync at all? I can definitely understnad how they would be the wrong version but not how they would be out of sync.

"> there is nothing wrong

Yes there is.  features that are coded differently and work differently than the rest of the IDE act as a tax on future maintainers.  It means that instead of having uniform patterns and approaches to solving problems, the maintainer has to figure out why things are done differently.  That's why we create supplementary APIs to address these common patterns, and why we want all our features to use them.  please do not be different here. This feature is not special and does not warrant side-stepping the infrastructure we've spent over a decade building.  

This is the philosophy we take with all our code action features (regardless of whether they are internally or externally contributed)."
Ah got it. That's crazy though.

"It's unfortunate we're adding another allocation.  We could explore ways to avoid it, e.g. using a type like:

    private readonly Timer _timer;
    private readonly CancellationTokenRegistration _reg1;
    private readonly CancellationTokenRegistration _reg2;

    public volatile bool TimerFired;

    public LinkedTimedCancellationTokenSource(CancellationToken token1, CancellationToken token2, TimeSpan timeout)
    {
        Action<object> cancelCallback = s => ((LinkedTimedCancellationTokenSource)s).Cancel();
        _reg1 = token1.UnsafeRegister(cancelCallback);
        _reg2 = token2.UnsafeRegister(cancelCallback);
        _timer = new Timer(s =>
        {
            var thisRef = (LinkedTimedCancellationTokenSource)s;
            thisRef.TimerFired = true;
            try { thisRef.Cancel(); } catch (ObjectDisposedException) { }
        }, this, timeout, Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan);
    }

    protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        _timer.Dispose();
        _reg2.Dispose();
        _reg1.Dispose();
        base.Dispose(disposing);
    }
}
```
and then constructing one of these when a timeout is set, e.g.
```C#
if (hasTimeout || cancellationToken.CanBeCanceled)
{
    disposeCts = true;
    cts = hasTimeout ?
        LinkedTimedCancellationTokenSource(cancellationToken, _pendingRequestsCts.Token, timeout) :
        CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(cancellationToken, _pendingRequestsCts.Token);
}
```
That then also implicitly handles the rooting issue, avoids the need to pass around the additional Timer (since it's encapsulated in the CTS), etc.

I'm not sure if it's worth it, but we already allocate a bunch of objects per request, and one of the things we want to look at in this release is driving that down, so increasing it is going in the wrong direction, especially when we end up paying it on all requests in order to handle an exceptional case."

But is that an issue if we delete that file during `ReadUTF8File` anyways?

- GDI has been generally superseded by the DirectX family of graphics technologies
- GDI is a kernel-mode based technology which we generally don't favor anymore primarily due to security
- GDI is old so its behavior and quirks are relied on by a large swath of existing software so any change is risky
- GDI is old... so none of the original owners or decision makers are around to inform changes anymore
- The team that owns GDI likely owns a handful of other technologies and areas that are more relevant to modern development
- This particular issue is new or hasn't been popular enough, on a broad developer market scale, for it to rank higher than the other ongoing work

I would guess that a combination of all of these factors go into the unlikelihood that `PolyTextOut` will be updated at this point.

However this skipped _originally_ null commit chars (indicating that the item should use commit chars from `Initialize`).  This resulted in the _second most used_ commit char set being promoted to the `CompletionList.CommitChars`, and both items with default chars and second most used commit chars having their commit chars nulled out.  This means for items that originally had null commit chars (aka use default from `Initialize`), the client would use the wrong commit chars from the completion list."

Because doing this correctly adds cost to workaround a server that's actively doing the wrong thing.

I assume the scenarios are tested under umbrella of dynamic analysis tests. I also had more context at the time, given that the feature was under active development and I was working on it. Right now, I am reviewing the code, the code that is either new, or significantly modified since then. The code that appears to use some different logic around invoking instrumentation. All I have to go from - is my intuition, which might or might not be wrong. If you are so against adding tests, I suggest a compromise - let's remove usage of the new API from the product and start using it when we can easily test its actual effect under different conditions, or add a PROTOTYPE comment in the right place to catch up on testing later.

"Ok.  So normal time here is 5 seconds on first run.  However, even with this PR we go to 30 seconds.   That's a 6x regression in perf here.  I imagine multiple runs will also incur perf issues.  Any sort of change (like an edit to the compiler layer) will force compilations and skeletons to be recreated for everything higher.

I'm planning on doing some work where we can allow stale results to eb returned.  I think i'll likely also make it so that during solution load we just do not run SGs. The perf hit is just too crazy high, and interferes significantly with trying to get results in a reasonable amount of time.

I think it's likely reasonable that we can say during loading that we dont' give SG results.  This is esp. so as we already put an notification in the NavTo box saying that results may be incomplete at this time."

Thanks for getting back to me! I really wasn't sure whether to prioritize making fewer changes and making it work with what's already there or to make changes like you suggested. I tried to think of how to solve the problem while making the smallest number of changes, then take one step towards what I would consider ideal. I wasn't sure what kind of philosophy there is about these kinds of things so I just guessed. Since my guess was wrong, I'll go back and make the changes I think would be ideal instead of trying to guess where my hands should be tied. I did kinda deviate from that anyway and got caught up a bit when I noticed a bunch of other issues while looking at the code. I will work on this more this week. I'll make this better.

"I guess my initial diagnosis of this issue was wrong. It turns out that `ins_Store(varTypes dstType)` meaning it expects the type of destination. The node that we are trying to codegen is storing the `float` to a static field and needs redirection of offset which is done using `STOREIND`. Currently we correctly pass the `tree->TypeGet()` to it instead of `data->TypeGet()`.

which means, we should do a `vmov tmpReg, t4` and then `str tmpReg [reg+offset]`, but that code is only kicked when `if ((indir->gtFlags & GTF_IND_UNALIGNED))` which happens in importer. Investigating why that is not set.

Also, for x86, the return type of `Method1` is `int` instead of `float` (done during lowering). Need to check that too. Since the type `TYP_INT` matches for both `t4` (the data) and the `tree` (`STOREIND` node), we don't see it happen on other platforms.

"I think what's going on is that there is an expectation that the PSP sym for both main method and funclet is the same delta from CallerSP. There is just one offset for this in the gc info.

This isn't the case currently; the OSR method delta includes the Tier0 frame size but we don't pad out the OSR funclet frame to match.

So we end up with a situation where we report PSPSym offset in gc info as -80 from Caller SP. For the OSR frame this is (-16 osr part of frame) + (-64 tier0 frame) and is fine.

But this offset doesn't work for the funclet; it's PSP sym is at (-16) with respect to Caller SP. So when we try and find the PSP sym value for the funclet we end up with the wrong value and things go downhill from there.

Options are to either pad the funclet frame or to have the OSR frame use the Tier0 frame's PSP Sym slot. The latter seems appealing but may not be possible as the PSP sym location varies depending on which regs get saved, and this differs between Tier0 frame and OSR frame (eg in this case the Tier0 PSP sym offset is at (-8).). If we tried to normalize for that by saving PSPSym first after varargs we might run into issues because the Tier0 frame spills varargs at top of frame and there's no reason for the OSR frame to do this (but see [note](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/62831#issuecomment-995371599)).

So as ugly as it seems, we may need to pad the funclet frame to include a phantom tier0 frame."

2) It should ignore methods with insufficient samples (currently if callsite's profile >= callsite's fgFirstBb->weight -- we consider it as hot) e.g. static constructors, etc
3) Re-vise ""report noinline to vm"" logic, sometimes it might bake ""noinline"" for methods which are good candidates for inlining within specific call-sites (e.g. with const args).

1. The `%(Filename)` item metadata causes the implicit `CreateItem` task to be batched
2. Use of that metadata also limits the `@(ResolvedCompileFileDefinitions)` and `@(RuntimeCopyLocalItems)` item groups to the item(s) with the same `%(Filename)`
    - This part doesn't seem to be explicit in the documentation
3. The `OR` clause confirms at least one such item exists

At a higher level, this creates a `@(_ProjectsToAdd)` item group containing those `@(_ProjectsInPatch)` items that match on filename with  one or more `@(ResolvedCompileFileDefinitions)` or `@(RuntimeCopyLocalItems)` items, excluding existing `@(ProjectReference)` items.

"> I'm not very familiar with workspaces

but you created this API 😄 

I'll mention the two options again. This API could be interpreted in 2 ways:
- `CanApplyChange(ApplyChangesKind.ChangeParseOptions)` returning true means the workspace is able to change *some* parse options - you don't know whether it can handle the option you want until you additionally call `CanApplyParseOptionChange`. So in this scenario, `CanApplyChange` really basically tells you nothing about what you can actually do. This *might have been* the original intent (but implemented incorrectly).
-  `CanApplyChange(ApplyChangesKind.ChangeParseOptions)` returning true means the workspace supports changing parse options, period. Any kind of change, and you can count on that. Now it may also support changing some specific options even if this returns false. If you check `CanApplyParseOptionChange`, you might find out that is the case. This is the existing implementation.

@github I see you're suggesting we should really have the first option. I think both of them make sense, but if we go with first, then the default value of `CanApplyCompilationChange` being false is wrong and would be a breaking change. Basically, until now, if you get true from `CanApplyChange(ApplyChangesKind.ChangeCompilationOptions)` you know the workspace supports changing any compilation options, but if we implement this the way you're suggesting, the new meaning would be ""no, this actually doesn't supports changing compilation options at all because `CanApplyCompilationChange` still always returns false"". If we go with number 1, the default implementation should return true. But there's also a problem that the existing implementation of `CanApplyParseChange` returns false. Meh :-/"

No. The documentation is wrong and this is the long-time safe use of this type. It's also the pattern we generate in the IDE refactorings to generate a `GetHashCode` method prior to the availability of `HashCode.Combine`. See dotnet/runtime#30998.

The contrapositive to this is: would be handled differently => new exception type

Each exception can carry two main pieces of information: the exception
message explaining to the developer what went wrong and how to fix it,
and the exception type that should be used by handlers to decide what programmatic
action to take. If you think you need to have a property on your
exception that would return additional error code, ask yourself who this
code is for. Is it for the developer or for the exception handler? If for the
developer, add additional information to the message. If for the handlers,
add a new exception type."

If I understood your concerns correctly, when the `titleHeight` is increased/decreased due to a new row of tabs being added/removed, the `editorHeight` doesn't properly update when `editorGroupView#layout` is called? When testing, I don't see that issue, am I missing something?:

>-  ...title control layout which returns its height that it ended up using

I can definitely try to cleanup the logic and have `titleAreaControl#layout` return it's height and recalculate the `editorHeight` based upon that.

> With this algorithm I would also think that you do not need to know the editor height, you can simply pass the overall height into the title control layout and then decide from within if the title should wrap or not.

Again I probably misunderstand what's going on, but is this not already being done in the `editorGroupView#layout` that was linked above? The `editorHeight` property I created for the group view was an attempt at fixing the overflowing tabs issue, I can remove that for now since it's currently not working/unnecessary.

> I would think that the tabs title control should have an event that is fired whenever the height changes and the editor group can register on that to trigger redraw.

Sure, I can create an event that fires when the height of the `tabsContainer` changes from what it previously was. However, I don't think the editor group can call `redraw`, would `editorGroupView#relayout` instead be called, thereby replacing this line?:

"Okay my immediate thoughts are around how we expose this action to the user. We're already running into similar struggles with `next/prevTab` and the tab switcher, so maybe we should try and pre-empt those issues with pane switching?

For reference, there's also discussion in #8025 that might be helpful.

So, with next/prev MRU switching, without some sort of dialog, those will just toggle between the last two used panes. If there's a fourth pane, that pane will be inaccessible with next/prev pane.

Also, having panes in the ATS is something we might want some day, with something like:

> * Tab 1:
>   - **Pane 1: cmd.exe**
>   - Pane 2: pwsh.exe
> * Tab 2:
>   - Pane 1: wsl.exe

whatever, you get it.

Plus, do we want to enable in-order next/prev traversal? Once we have pane IDs, then presumably, yea.

Do we want to overload `moveFocus` to accept `next` and `prev`, or would having another action entirely be better? Here are some proposals:

// Focus pane 1
// - This is sensible, no arguments here
{ command"": { ""action"": ""focusPane"", ""id"": 1 } },

// Focus the next in order pane, don't use the switcher
// - We'd have to ensure that an id and order aren't passed at the same time, and that might be unintuitive
// - How do we specify next/prev? ""direction"" seems wrong, but maybe we keep the
//   FocusDirection(up|down|left|right|next|prev) enum and have one focus action 
//   to rule them all
{ command"": { ""action"": ""focusPane"", ""order"": ""inOrder"", useSwitcher"": false } },

// Focus the next MRU pane
// - Withough the switcher, this can only go one pane deep in the MRU stack
// - presumably once there's a pane switcher, it would default to enabled?
{ command"": { ""action"": ""focusNextPane"", ""order"": ""mru"" } },

// Focus the prev inOrder pane
// - this seems straightforward
{ command"": { ""action"": ""focusPrevPane"", ""order"": ""inOrder"" } },

// Focus the next pane, in mru order, explicitly disable the switcher
// - The user opted in to only being able to MRU switch one deep. That's fine, that's what they want.
{ command"": { ""action"": ""focusNextPane"", ""order"": ""mru"", ""useSwitcher"": false} },

// Focus the prev inOrder pane, explicitly with the switcher
// - Maybe they disabled the switcher globally, but what it on for this action?

Now, `!!` takes care of throwing if `localSignature` is null.

I think this is good - you're right that we should not do any work if we know it's going to fail. So I like this change in general (I have yet to look at the implementation details).
As for the risk of taking this - I think it's very small, we still fail, and we avoid loading runtime. This is very unlikely to break people (not counting that it's very unlikely that anybody released an app which calls the API with the wrong value as it would not work anyway).

> Error code when trying to load SCD component

I'm not sure about this one. I do agree that the returned value is not great (misleading to say the least). That said I know about several cases where the exact exist code is used by calling code to make decisions. So changing it feels risky to me. If this would be a change in the runtime I would not worry too much as we're OK taking small breaking changes in major releases (with good reason). Unfortunately this is a change in `hostfxr` which doesn't really have the same freedom - it's global and callers always end up calling the latest version. So even minor breaking changes are a problem.

I think we should not make this change - I know the number value is bad, but we at least print out the right error message."

"My intuition tells me that we are likely taking a ""wrong"" approach for achieving the goal. I feel like a better approach would be to revert relevant parts of  #46308 instead of adding special APIs to neutralize their effect. We could simply remove the effect in the first place. I also think that it might make sense to deal with top level statements at the same time and in the same manner (finding the PR that changed the behavior for them), because they are likely to be closely related in terms of implementation strategy. Records probably build on top of what was added for top level statements, etc. And dealing with them together is likely to be much easier, more code can be removed at once rather than carefully trying to maintain an undesired behavior for one feature, but not for the other.

"> I have seen community feedback has been that the more info we include the better

We've also seen the community complain about stack trace text being overly noisy/confusing and then being very happy when work was done to simplify it (for example Ben Adams added the StackTraceHidden attribute to remove frames).

I'm not convinced this feature will be easy for most devs to use even if we leave it on by default. Converting the IL offsets back into source line offsets requires the developer gives a path to the correct build's PDBs. Unlike dump debugging we have no way to warn them if they specify the wrong ones (because there is no module versioning info in the output text).

I also lean towards saying this behavior should be off by default for this release as we continue to get feedback. We could always blog about this or put it in our docs as alternate ways to spread awareness.

`AppContext.BaseDirectory` sounds more interesting, but it is also not _semantically_ what we want, though I agree it is super likely to be correct. And, it's immutable, and set ""outside"" of the logic of the app (that is, the app doesn't decide for itself once it's running what the value should be). Same story with `Assembly.GetEntrypointAssembly().Location`.

I see no benefit to have this method in this type, it is better to not mix decoding of what is in attribute with its semantic analysis. For simple cases like this (nothing to decode, no args to decode, etc) we do all the processing inside ```DecodeWellKnownAttributeAppliedToMethod```, including all error reporting. Especially that some errors are context depended, i.e. when the attribute is applied to a non-static or an inaccessible method, etc. It is fine to extract the code into a local function within ```DecodeWellKnownAttributeAppliedToMethod``` or a private helper next to it.

Regarding diagnostics, I believe the rules are rather simple and there aren't that many of them. So, I am surprised to hear that the code is going to be that complex. But I might be wrong.

An object should encapsulate it's own behaviour knowing nothing about the world. If there should be a property like AutoClose, It should reside in the container that contains items because then that is it's responsibility. but to put AutoClose in an object for the sake of desired client behaviour is wrong OOP.

Can I use SwipeView outside listing scenario? Yes, hence AutoClose is violating OOP if you put in this class.

"@github this is the location I was talking about yesterday where I managed to get the binder usage down to just one call: http://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp/Binder/Semantics/OverloadResolution/MethodTypeInference.cs,1334 (the rest of the usages in the chain can be replaced by passing the nested thing on the binder it's accessing). Unfortunately, that last call doesn't seem to be easily fixable. The only time `_binder` should be null is when we're binding the body of an unbound lambda, trying to figure out the return type of that lambda. I'm not certain getting the binder from the compilation is the right thing to do here, particularly around speculation and potentially getting the wrong binder for such cases. Do you have any thoughts?

I still have a bit of other work to do on this PR around using/foreach dispose argument binding, so no rush on this question. #Closed"
"`takeOwnership` will not help. Every result is written to the rented or stack-allocated buffer. So there is no way to escape it using this parameter. The buffer passed to `BigInteger(ReadOnlySpan<uint>)` ctor must be copied using `ToArray` in any case.

Anyway, I tried to use assumption that most operations don't have leading zeroes and use heap-allocated arrays instead of renting or stack-alloc. I can conclude that this assumption is wrong because in 50% of cases the result contains leading zeroes. `BigInteger(ReadOnlySpan<uint>)` ctor in attempt to conserve space creates truncated copy of the original array. As a result, we have redundant allocation of the array for the result.

Let me explain this fact in details and choose `Add` operation for example. Before doing arithmetic operation for non-trivial operands I need to pre-allocate buffer for the result. The size of the result buffer is `Max(Digits(X), Digits(Y)) + 1` where `Digits` pseudo-function is the number of digits in the specified operand. In our case it's a length of the uints array. After computation the reserved highest position in the buffer may remain unused and must be removed from the resulting array. I see no way to predict the usage of reserved position in the result buffer and apply decision about correct allocation strategy. That's why `takeOwnership` in the current implementation not useful."

"We usually don't throw `NotImplementedException`. The [docs say](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.notimplementedexception.aspx):

> 1. You've designed a type in which you want to include a particular member as part of its public interface, but intend to provide the implementation in a later version. In this case, you can throw a NotImplementedException exception for versions on which the functionality is not implemented, and provide an implementation for later versions.
> 2. You've designed a type with one or more members that are available on some platforms or in some versions but not on others. In this case, you can throw a NotImplementedException exception on platforms on which the functionality is not supported.
> 3. You're creating an abstract base class with some members for which you want to provide no implementation but expect derived class to provide the implementation when they override the member. In this case, your member can throw a NotImplementedException exception.

I'd say that (1) is extremely odd and you shouldn't be doing this. Until you implement something you don't know whether the design works. (2) is just plain wrong, the code should throw `PlatformNotSupportedException`. (3) seems more reasonable and is basically the case here.

My high-level feedback would be that you should avoid adding virtual members that throw. Instead, I'd try to ensure that design has a reasonable default implementation, for instance, by forwarding to existing APIs. If that's not possible, at least add some actionable message. Simply failing with `NotImplementedException` will look like a bug in Roslyn.

"Suppressions are a hack for hacking your way out of issues a cast won't fix (like weird inheritance issues). But a cast will fix almost any issue (even those issues if you're creative with where you cast and to what) - every example you have here can be fixed with a single `any` cast (on the receiver, library itself, or argument), which is much better handled in the language. In other cases, where you have a massive chunk of unchecked code, the per-file directive is fine. If a third party lib has the wrong type, you cast to the correct type or `any`, up to you, a suppression is completely incorrect and the wrong solution to the problem.

Honestly, we thought suppressions were a bad idea to begin with and I had to argue they had uses when migrating JS projects to TS (essentially as automatable TODOs since per issue suppressions are easy to place automatically). But some people turn to them rather than the much simpler cast, and seeing the arguments here just reinforces that - suppressions aren't ""better"" than a cast - they're much much worse, and they leave the compiler in a silent error state where things may not behave as expected. They are an absolute last resort, and _honestly_ the presence of a suppression should itself be an error, to indicate that the project has unchecked code that may have unintended cascading effects on downstream code (like quietly leaking an `any` that isn't caught by `noImplicitAny`).

If anyone is left thinking a suppression like this is their only possible solution, then we've failed in our documentation somewhere - even in JS we support jsdoc casts now, so you can cast out of almost any issues in JS, too. (Even missing imports can be fixed with `declare module` declarations)"

"> Ah, so the native library (which sees the type as an enum/integer) still does single register, but since the P/Invoke Marshaller sees the type as a struct it tries unpacking it per struct rules, resulting in a mismatch?

Exactly.  The marshaller prepares a buffer on the stack, and passes a pointer to that buffer to the native routine, expecting the native routine to fill (what it thinks to be) the struct to be returned in.   But native code thinks it returns an integer, and so doesn't expect a buffer pointer but simply returns the integer in register.   (Plus the presence of the return pointer shifts the other arguments by one slot, which native code also doesn't expect, so the incoming arguments are already wrong.)"

* The runtime defines `_MonoRuntimeAvailableComponents` which is an item list like `""hot_reload;diagnostic_tracing""`
* The workoad defines `_MonoComponent` which is some subset of the times that makes sense in the current configuration of the user app
* The workload calls the `_MonoSelectRuntimeComponents` target
  * The target returns `_MonoRuntimeSelectedComponents` (and `_MonoRuntimeSelectedStubComponents` if static linking) which are the _names_ of the comopnents that will be available (or stubbed out, if static linking)
  * The target returns `_MonoRuntimeComponentLink` which is a list of _filenames_ (relative to the runtime pack `native/` subdirectory) of the libraries that must be either copied (for dynamic loading) or statically linked (for static linking) with the runtime.  The items also have some metadata such as `IsStub`, `ComponentName` and `Linking`

   - the `component-manifest.props` file is RID-dependent for two reasons: whether we do static or dynamic linking of components depends on the target platform, and the file extensions also depend on the platform.
   - the list of components is currently hardcoded in the pkgproj, but it should really come from the source of truth: src/mono/mono/component/CMakeLists.txt

Roslyn analysers have been shipping them with this flag turned for a while now. generators are self contained so i don't expect to leak the assembly version to someplace else. The mitigation in case of a low probability event can be handled by pinning to a higher version.

Here there is a potential loop from 57...137. We try and compact and move the range 60...109. But then we fail to compact after that.

The next loop runs from 71...136, but we've moved the first part of the loop down past the seocnd, so that 136 now sits above 71. And when we try to compact that loop we walk off the end of the bbNext chain.

"> The one that signalr catches and handles gracefully is WebsocketException when reason = ClosedWithoutSendingCloseFrame

This is a behavior we've gone back and forth about. Customers have been adamant that this kind of error is too noisy, but it still feels wrong that we suppress it. The reality is that any failure to complete the closing process is considered an error by the spec.

Also, the underlying [WebSocket implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/Common/src/System/Net/WebSockets/ManagedWebSocket.cs) won't ever actually produce IOExceptions. It explicitly wraps them in WebSocketExceptions with the error code `ConectionClosedPrematurely`.

Perhaps having a way for a Hub to indicate that it's willing to see even these more ""noisy"" failures is appropriate. For a system like Blazor it makes sense to want to tell the difference here. I think we should've left this error in the `OnDisconnectedAsync` handler instead of suppressing it. Maybe 3.0 can justify changing that behavior but we'd need quite a bit of backup to get that through ask mode."
"@github feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here, but I'm pretty sure the idea is not to change HubMessage.java at all. The idea is to simply change this JsonHubProtocol.writeMessage method to serialize using a JsonWriter and put all the type-specific logic for serializing each HubMessage type to JSON inside of JsonHubProtocol.java itself.

So instead of having an `abstract void write(JsonWriter writer);` implementation on InvocationMessage and calling `message.write(writer)` from JsonHubProtocol.writeMessage, you would have a `if (message instanceof InvocationMessage) { ... } else if (message instanceof ...`. It's less object-oriented, but it will make adding non-JSON protocols like MessagePack easier in the future. Instead of every HubMessage needing to know how to serialize using JsonWriter, MessagePackWriter and whatever else, all the serialization logic stays within the protocol class this way."
"If the server is not caching at all, then it's not problematic. That's one of the benefits of this whole new feature.

If it's doing caching wrong in certain ways (e.g., returning headers to cache for a specific time period regardless of content changes) then there will be trouble but that's also true for all their other static resources, index.html, etc.

The only scenario I had in mind for why `cache: 'no-cache'` would be really beneficial is if, at some point, we support loading these resources from an external CDN. At that point, every site has its own `CacheStorage` but shares the browser's regular HTTP cache. By using `cache: 'no-cache'` you get to re-use the warm HTTP cache to populate a new site's `CacheStorage`.

However I recognize that's not a scenario that actually happens today so it's more ambiguous where the best tradeoff lies. I somewhat prefer keeping `cache: 'no-cache'` so nobody could say we were breaking them later if we changed from `'reload'` to `'no-cache'` in the future when adding CDN support.

Do you feel strongly about this? I'm open to changing it if so. Please ping me to discuss!"

Seems like the right fix is to override the XxAsync methods on IndentedTextWriter appropriately.  That will address both this issue (the overrides can do the right thing with regards to indents) and the async-over-sync issue."

"@github I added a test in InvocationExpressionSignatureHelpProviderTests:

        {
            var markup = @""

"
"I'm concerned about the lifetime mechanics of this type.  It contains pointers, so we need to ensure that they're freed, which would imply that it should have a destructor.

...because *as is*, `names`/`assemblies_bytes`/`assemblies_bytes_len` will *not* be freed from [`add_or_replace_entry`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/3365/files#diff-23d896d4af9a6583e2643499634eb15fR115) or [`clear_for_domain`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/3365/files#diff-23d896d4af9a6583e2643499634eb15fR94).

OK, so there's a known memory leak here.  It needs fixing.

But *how*?  The *normal* C++ solution would be a ""proper"" constructor, plus destructor, plus assignment operator (plus others?):

```cpp
struct InMemoryAssemblyEntry {
    InMemoryAssemblyEntry()
        : domain_id(-1), assemblies_count(0), names(nullptr), assemblies_bytes(nullptr), assemblies_bytes_len(nullptr)
    {
    }
    ~InMemoryAssemblyEntry()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < assemblies_count; ++i) {
            delete[] names [i];
            delete[] assemblies_bytes [i];
        }
        delete[] names;
        delete[] assemblies_bytes;
        delete[] assemblies_bytes_len;
    }
    InMemoryAssemblyEntry& operator=(const InMemoryAssemblyEntry& other) {
        // ...?
    }
};
```

The *other* SNAFU here is that `InMemoryAssemblyEntry` instances are used with `memcpy()`! https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/3365/files#diff-23d896d4af9a6583e2643499634eb15fR128

This *immediately* makes the ""normal"" C++ approach feel ""wrong"", because `memcpy()` knows nothing of destructors.  It's ""probably"" fine, but it *really* makes me side-eye it.

Which is where a `std::vector<InMemoryAssemblyEntry>` starts looking *much* nicer, but as you [mentioned earlier](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/3365#discussion_r316209406) this has complications.

I'm thus not sure of the appropriate path forward.  THERE ARE MEMORY LEAKS."

"ok, i checked on things.  we already throw in caes where there is a true invariatn issue.

What's going on here though is that we are resilient to legal things a caller might do.  For example, we may have the persistence service, but the user may just 'new up' a workspace/solution in memory that has no set solution-path.  It's totally legal to call into us, asking us to store data.  In that case we just return 'false' to say ""sorry, we couldn't do it"".  

THe value of this flag is that i'm effectively telling the system: you're in a context where this sort of behavior *of the caller* should be considered a bug.  It's useful when testing things out so that we can distinguish why we get certain results (for example, did we fail to read a stream because we truly didn't have it, or because the input was wrong)."

My proposed names would be 'wrapper_js_handle' for the handle (so it's clear that it's not a handle to the *actual* js function target) and 'wrapper' for the local. We may also need to do a check here of some sort to ensure that the jsobj we got is actually a bound function and not something else, since they appear to live in a global handle namespace and someone writing broken code could accidentally pass the wrong kind of handle to the invoke icall.

> Can you elaborate on why this limitation was placed on partial methods previously. Having a small history or the design reasons would be informative.

The feature `partial` methods was originally created to help out designer code generation patterns. Developers wanted to add code at the end of certain designer generated methods like ctos, `InitializeComponent`, etc ... In the early days of generators the only way to do this was to go edit the generated file and add a call into your user defined code. This was really brittle because every time the generator re-ran the added user call would be ""deleted"" because it wasn't a part of the standard code gen. 

Generators could have helped here by emitting a call to a well named method at the end of `InitializeComponent`. However if that method didn't exist it would be a compilation error and a breaking change. 

The `partial` methods feature helps this because it's a conditional hook method. The generator both emits the call to `OnInitializeComponentCompleted` and the `partial` method signature. 

```cs
partial void OnHookCompleted();
```

This is safe to do because if the user doesn't define `OnHookCompleted` then the compiler will just delete the call to it at the end of `OnInitializeCompleted`. Now designer generators can safely emit hook behavior in a completely back compat fashion. 

The `void` restriction exists because the feature specifically allows for the `partial` method invocation to be deleted. If the language allowed non-void return methods then it would allow for scenarios like this:

```cs
partial int SomeMethod();

...
// what is the value of ""i"" if the call to SomeMethod is deleted?
int i = SomeMethod(); 
```

My thinking here is that we could relax the `void` restriction and supplement with a rule essentially like the following:

> partial methods which are non-void returning **must** have an implementation method

That didn't really make sense in the context of the original feature but would make sense in the context of source generators. There the `partial` would just be the template the user is directing the source generator to implement for them. Hence return values make a lot of sense.

Again caveats: take this more as my internal musings vs. actual direction idea. I wasn't on the C# team when `partial` methods were added so I may lack some context. Will bring this up though with others next week to get their opinion on it. 

Note: it's been a while so I'm sure I got a few of the method names wrong. The overall scenario though is correct. "

"> It seems like the HTTP callback is not ready to called multiple times.

This is specific to HttpClientHandler (you're not hitting this when using SocketsHttpHandler directly, right?).  The callback signature from HttpClientHandler expects the HttpRequestMessage to be passed in, so we need to capture the instance into the closure used for the underlying RemoteCertificateValidationCallback so that it can be in turn passed to the handler's ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback.  But as a result of capturing it in that way, the HttpRequestMessage would end up being referenced for the lifetime of the callback, thus keeping it alive and from being garbage collected.  The fix for this issue (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36979) was to null out the field after the callback was invoked (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/37021), with the assumption that it wouldn't be invoked again.  If it is invoked again, then it triggers the assert put in place to validate it wasn't being invoked again.

So, we have a choice to make, either:
1. Ensure the callback is never invoked multiple times.  But it sounds like that's not actually viable, that it's expected to be invoked multiple times in the face of renegotation if the certificate changes.
2. Allow null to be passed instead of the original message on renegotation.  This is in fact what's happening today, and the nullable annotation on the parameter is wrong.  But if we want to accept that, then a) we need to remove the assert, and b) we need to change the first argument of the callback from `HttpRequestMessage` to `HttpRequestMessage?` to signify that it can actually be null, so that callbacks guard against it if they happen to be using the request message.
3. Hold on to the message for the lifetime of the connection in case it may be needed for a subsequent callback invocation, essentially reverting #37021.
4. Expose something on HttpClientHandler to allow this choice to be made by the dev, e.g. exposing AllowRenegotation.  But as it would default to true as is currently the case, this choice alone is likely insufficient.

None of these options seem great, but (2) is probably the best.  @github? (@github, FYI on nullable annotations)"
"Yeah, you're not wrong; I just can't immediately think of another way to fix the original issue (at least not one that doesn't totally overhaul inference, anyway), so trying to make this performant sounds like the best avenue to pursue."
"What methods specifically do you need optimized? The only one that is likely to regress is `Equals(StringSegment)`, because it's now bouncing through an indirection. But I can hand-tune that if needed.

Reiterating my earlier comment: if this is _really_ in a hot path, seriously consider allowing some behavioral changes here. For instance, the fact that there's special-casing all over the place to distinguish between `default(StringSegment)` and `StringSegment.Empty` leads to unnecessary complexity + slower perf. Allowing the two to be treated as equivalent would optimize things.

Allowing this change in behavior would make existing methods dumb wrappers around the already highly-optimized span versions. For example:

```cs
// Pretty much the whole call stack gets inlined into the caller at this point.
public bool Equals(StringSegment other) => this.AsSpan().SequenceEquals(other.AsSpan());
```"
">  allowing to reference managed-only linux RID-specific implementations that e.g. just p/invoke (which work and we want to have) versus pulling in native .so files for linux that definitely won't just work on android.

Do packages need to provide a different native asset in order to work on android?  If so they can provide that in the `android-arm64` folder.

Do packages need to not provide any native asset to work on android?  If so they can make that happen by adding an empty `android-arm64` folder.  Can't change the package?  Consumers can add `ExcludeAssets=""native""` on the PackageReference.

There's no promise that a package that specializes for a platform will just work on a brand new platform that they've never considered.  RIDs try to do their best to represent useful reuse, so that more often than not folks can avoid duplication when they specialize by platform.  They can't get it right 100% of the time, but when its wrong there should be a way to make a package specialize for the new platform once the author understands it needs to.  We should only be changing RID hierarchy if there is data out there showing that a majority of the time the RID graph leads to duplication rather than reuse."
"@github it looks like I misremembered the behaviour of Windows links.
(Current behaviour) It gets the time on the link file, but sets the time onto the target file (this seems inconsistent to me).
What should the expected behaviour be? I personally feel like it should be both get and set on the link itself (which is what I've implemented for Mac), which would make more sense with the eventual completion of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/projects/41 to me, and also how I'd like to use it in my code.
In my code it looks like I just disabled setting time on links on Windows because it could crash if the target doesn't exist.
I didn't/haven't yet invested time into seeing how to set the time on links using low-level Windows APIs.
Also, it should be noted that my test would pass if the set and get both did either the target or the link itself.
How should we continue @github, should I just add Windows to the ActiveIssue attribute as well as the other failing platforms, or do something else? I'm happy for discussion to be had about what the correct behaviour should be, but personally I need some way to set it on the link itself: whether it's using a different api or not doesn't bother me.
Explanation of my logic with links:
Functions that work with the target (windows afaik): Set times, Reads and writes (it makes sense that it would be this to me)
Functions that work with the link itself (windows afaik): Delete, Exists, Get times, GetAttributes
I'm not sure where other APIs are.
To me it would make sense for all the APIs to work with the link itself, except for reading/writing the content (since link files have no visible content and this is the point of links). With the link API proposed in #24271 one could simply get the target and set attributes (time, attributes, etc.) on the target if they so desired.
Obviously if we're setting it on a file in a symlink folder then it makes sense to do it on the real file.
Also of note: I currently emulate a large portion of the logic in #24271 in one way or another as I wanted to be able to manipulate links, but I couldn't find a different way to do it other than writing interop code myself for Windows, and on Mac I just called the `ln` executable.
Edit: also my test seems to be failing on Mac despite testing it locally, I must have done something wrong locally, I'll fix the test in the next commit.
Edit 2: I don't seem to be able to repro the issues with the test locally yet (specifically SettingUpdatesPropertiesOnSymlink), which is odd. I've confirmed that the dates are set on the link files by pausing it just before the test finishes, not sure what's happening here."

This is just a variable rename. Is there more to come?

"I would add some sort of note about about this since it's basically a hack to get around the fact we only register images based on the filename. It's quite possible someone is confused by this down the line.

I'd probably also add a note in `mono_image_open_a_lot_parameterized` about the function's lack of awareness of this hack. If you load a satellite image by name for one culture with it and then attempt to load a second culture after, you should get the wrong image. This is not a regression, and I believe is how this has worked for a long time now, but it's the one place we *didn't* fix this."

"@github Correct me if I'm wrong but I think it instantiates 2,097,152 (`1 << 21`) dictionaries.

Are you sure? Just curious because I was asked before to move that to the BaseShellItem. If you can double-check and confirm I will make them attached properties again."
"Sorry about the delay, I'm pretty sure this branch is causing the problem since you're targeting a different element? I might be wrong but you should resync with `main` since it definitely doesn't happen on the latest."
"There's a ton of work that needs to be done on the conapi interface before we can merge. Other than that, we need to make sure that everything that's currently only implemented in `TerminalDispatch` is also copied across to `AdaptDispatch`. And as I said above, if you're copying functionality from `AdaptDispatch` (like these tabs), it's preferable if the code is essentially identical between the two.

So as long as you're doing that, I don't think there's anything wrong with this PR. I'm just not sure why we actually need the functionality in `TerminalDispatch` at this point. Are we intending to pass these tab sequences through conpty?"
A nit - wrong indentation
It started out with the elipses. Then I swear I saw a different processing pop up without it and thought I had made the wrong choice.
nit: `regRec` is wrong here.
"I'm not sure this is right for unpackaged versions of the Terminal. I might want to tap in @github for this bit, hes a bit more familiar with running the Terminal unpackaged. 

Just looking at my own files, I've only got a `%localAppData%\Microsoft\Windows Terminal`.

Heck, I'm not sure this is ever relevant for Preview builds running unpackaged - I think they always just use `%localAppData%\Microsoft\Windows Terminal` anyways. I might be wrong here. "
"For type declarations like `partial record C ...`, we were relying on `IsPartialMember` returning `true` (didn't investigate how/why), which resulted in same behavior but arguably for the wrong reason.

I want to read top-down, assuming that information at the top is ""more important"".  (See also: every `man` page?)

Yet here we have a `Locating essential tool binaries` *section*, which *isn't* useful.  Then we get to a brief description, but nothing really useful.

(Actually, *every command* prints out this `Locating essential tool binaries` section, which is *useless noise*.  Unless something goes wrong, why do I want to see this?  Why should `xat list` show me the path to `git` or `brew`?)

I would suggest output similar to:

A month+ later, I'm still not able to remember, understand, or conceptualize the difference between a ""group"" and a ""suite"".  Perhaps different nouns should be used?

I can't quickly see what `xat list -m` *does*, other than emit more blank lines.

I wonder if a concept of ""tags"" would be more useful?  E.g. `AOT_Mono_Android` could have tags `{ aot Mono.Android.dll }`, `AOT_Xamarin_Forms_Performance_Integration` could have tags of `{ aot forms timing }`, etc.?

Is there/should there be a way to *search*/*filter* `xat list` output? `xat list -g`/`xat list -s` does a form of filtering, but -- as per above -- I don't *understand* this difference.

***EXAMPLES***.  The ""Documentation"" -- both in the commit message, and `xat --help`, and `xat run --help`, *everything* needs examples.

I should have read `tools/xat/README.md` first.  Doh.  It still lacks examples.

""test"" is possibly an overused noun.  Consider the `xat run --help` output:

```
% tools/xat/run.sh run --help
…
usage: xat run [OPTIONS]
By default the command runs all the tests.
```

OK, it runs tests.

```
  -g, --group=GROUPS         Run the specified GROUPS. Takes a comma-separated
                               list of test group names or can be repeated on
                               command line
  -s, --suite=SUITES         Run the specified SUITES. Takes a comma-separated
                               list of test suite names or can be repeated on
                               command line
```

what's the relation between these, again?

```
The arguments below use suite-specific format for each entry. 
```

Oh boy.

```
… They are ignored if a test suite runs as part of predefined group:
```

I have no idea what this means. What makes a ""group"" a ""predefined"" group? Why would they be ignored?  Why should they be ignored?  If I do `xat run -g APK_all_tests`, shouldn't `-n`/`-d`/`-a` be applicable?  This header suggests ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

```
  -t, --test=TESTS           Run the specified TESTS. Takes a comma-separated
                               list of test names
```

So run the specified tests.  What happens with `-t` is used in combination with `-g=` or `-s=`? Is it additive? Set intersection?  Other?

```
  -i, --include-categories=CATEGORIES
                             Run tests in the specified CATEGORIES. Takes a
                               comma-separated list of test categories
```

So tests have categories?  (This is presumably the NUnit/xUnit concept of categories?) How does this relate to groups & suites?  *Does* it?  *Should* it?

What *is* `Unit_No_Node`? It doesn't appear to *do* anything:

```
% tools/xat/run.sh run -g Unit_No_Node
… prints out tool paths …
```

Some of the suite names also contain ""duplicative"" strings, and not necessarily in a way that ""conveys meaning"":

  * `JavaInterop_Java_Interop_Tests`
  * `JavaInterop_Java_Interop_Dynamic_Tests`
  * `JavaInterop_Java_Interop_Export_Tests`
  * …

Both ""Java"" and ""Interop"" are repeated twice in each suite name, but what's it *mean*? It needs to be unique, certainly, but why not trim off the `JavaInterop_` prefix?  (Perhaps another place where ""tags"" could be a useful concept?)

I suggested earlier that ""names"" -- not sure if I meant group name or suite name, and I still don't know the difference -- could/should be *filesystem paths*, because then at least I *know* what it corresponds to.  I have no idea what `JavaInterop_Java_Interop_Tests` is.  There are *at least two separate projects* for ""`Java.Interop-Tests`"":

  * `external/Java.Interop/tests/Java.Interop-Tests`: Desktop unit tests for `Java.Interop.dll` (in `Java.Interop-Tests.dll`)
  * `tests/Mono.Android-Tests/Java.Interop-Tests`: Unit tests for `Java.Interop.dll` for use within the `Mono.Android-Tests`.

With some thought, I *think* the second one isn't ""applicable"", because it'll be ""included"" in `Mono.Android-Tests`, but this is *thinking* that I don't necessarily want to perform. Reading the source code doesn't immediately help either!

```csharp
{ ""Java.Interop-Tests.dll"",                            Path.Combine (""Java.Interop-Tests"",                            ""Java.Interop-Tests.csproj"") },
```

How many `Java.Interop-Tests/Java.Interop-Tests.csproj` files are there?

```
% find . -iname Java.Interop-Tests.csproj
./tests/Mono.Android-Tests/Java.Interop-Tests/Java.Interop-Tests.csproj
./external/Java.Interop/tests/Java.Interop-Tests/Java.Interop-Tests.csproj
```

That's right, 2.

In short, the `JavaInterop_Java_Interop_Tests` suite name does me no favors, the ""Host Unit"" name of `JavaInterop: Java.Interop-Tests` doesn't help me, and the *source code* doesn't help me.  The only thing that *might* help, maybe, *if I got it right*, is mental effort to *exclude* one of the tests projects I know of, on the assumption that it's inclusion ""doesn't make sense.""

I'm thinking too hard already. :-(

What *would* be a useful ""grouping"" to me would be ""all AOT tests"".  No such grouping exists.

```
% ./tools/xat/run.sh run -s Mono_Android
…
```

What's the output look like when there's a *failure*?  Examples welcome!

As-is, output is, again, *verbose* (yay?), but not all is necessarily *useful*?

```

```

Those functions are only defined for i386/x86_64. For arm64, the variation without `xamarin_dyn` are also defined. However, we hit a bit of a bind here in the definition of this because it's both required (for the x64 build) and not available (in the arm64 build). From what I understand, on arm64, we don't actually need those functions for things to work, so if I'm not wrong, we should probably refactor the symbol requirement per targeted architectures (so that we pass those symbols when building for x86_64, but not when building for arm64)."

"@github I'm still having difficulty debugging the unittests, but I've fixed them so that they run correctly from a copy of VS, as well as fixing the issues that popped up when run in that mode. (The ExplictLayoutSize test was wrong, and the TestMethodLookup test was not specifying the correct signature."
"> I don't know what this means, but I guess I might need to try again to add the project from Visual Studio.

It just means that the GUID used in the SLN file is incorrect. The line which declares the project , and likely the subsetquent consupmions, use the wrong GUID. "
"Looks like control-flow is wrong as well:

##### Case 1

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3902892/97092011-26611700-15f5-11eb-9e63-964dcd5762d0.png)

`y` should be `0` because the default is evaluated before the computed property name. 

##### Case 2
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3902892/97092000-03366780-15f5-11eb-9bb3-5610a1dbf46a.png)

Here `y` should be `9` because the default evaluates first.

##### Cases 3 & 4
We also don't seem to narrow when we know the default *won't* be evaluated:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3902892/97092073-9a032400-15f5-11eb-99ea-f571fd32d2e1.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3902892/97092083-c028c400-15f5-11eb-99c1-f9cf4acdae07.png)

In both cases above, `y` should be `8` because the default will never be evaluated due to the fact the outer destructured value is a tuple with a  fixed length.

##### Case 5
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3902892/97091961-a63ab180-15f4-11eb-9c02-80a1db93755b.png)

In this case `y` should be `0 | 8` because we don't know the length of the outer destructured array, and `0` should be the constituent instead of `1` because of Case 1 (above).

##### Case 6

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3902892/97091977-bbafdb80-15f4-11eb-97d0-bbfcb922b011.png)

This case should probably be considered correct. `y` should be `0 | 8` because we don't know the length of the outer destructured array.

"Sorry to bother you @github, I just created a similar PR as #40906 but with all the options I found on MDN page.  
Could you tell me what would be wrong with this fix please? _(First PR in TypeScript)_"

Moving Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms and Microsoft.NETCore.Targets  to csproj so that we can directly add project references to these csprojs. 
This will also correct the assets.json file which is currently missing this dependencies or contains the wrong version.
This will further help in pack task in calculating dependencies. Currently this is done on the dynamically in a target.
We can utilize this to use the live version of these projects in the installer as well.

"> I'm not thrilled with summarily setting inlinee counts to zero if the call site count is zero, but for now it's the best we can do

I guess it means if the profile for callsite's block is wrong - we're also losing usefull profile of the inlinee?"
"> The x86 failure looks like a bug exposed by this change, it is probably not caused by this. We should open an issue about it/disable the test in this PR and merge it before the feature complete.

actually, I was wrong, it is the issue in this change because one `size>0` condition was dropped, so now we are failing with assert on such tree:
```

sounds like we should have deleted that tree during importation:

```
but we did not, maybe because it has to throw when the address is null?

"@github by my accounting this fixes all the test cases you sent me except for these 3:

```
11656046881568048475.cs
2692166044414030864.cs 
11738605779775786426.cs (hits jit assert)
```
The first two look like cases that should be handled by my fixes, so I will need to dig into them to see what is going wrong. In both cases the write/read sequence happens after a nested loop."

In the original code if there were scanner issues False was returned and there was a single error message that listed all the ways your code might be wrong but it was not specific. Here if we are in the new code we never return an errors to a higher level to deal with. We parse the code, decide that we are in new code and then if we find an error we add the diagnostic with specific new message about what is wrong. This has the advantage that we didn't have to retest everything (it was @github  idea)."

You are referencing what should be the same thing through entirely different paths of poperties/expressions.  That is fundamentally confusing.  It makes the code harder to read and understand.

The person reading the code now has to go: wait... i thought these wer ethe same... are they not?  Why is the code referencing it in different ways.

And, because there is no comment, one now has to go: ""is this intentional?  would it be subtly wrong if to switch one to use the same expression as the other?""

This sort of coding is brittle and leads to difficulty with maintaining things.  it should be avoided, especially around exceptionally subtle stuff like cancellation/threading.

Analyzer driver filters out implicitly declared symbols all over the code. The work to get analyzer actions fired as appropriate is on the books.

"Hokay, so I _think_ I've got it re-expanding the list of commands each time the list of tabs changes, and I don't think it's noticable. 

I hate it, because it involves having `TerminalPage` _make a copy_ of the commands from `CascadiaSettings`, then expand that copy, every time the list of tabs changes. But on the bright side, `CascadiaSettings` won't need to know anything about the list of tabs when the expansion happens. `CascadiaSettings` would only keep the original blob of commands around, and they'd _need_ to be expanded before the palette could use them. This seems not horrible.

The copying is going to be more annoying when the map of commands isn't just an `unordered_map`. We'd need to be able to clone the original `winrt::...Map` into a new one, then expand the commands using only methods that are exposed by the _projection_. Assuming that we want to have `ExpandCommands` eventually take a list of the current tabs, this means that the projected `ExpandCommands` would either need to:
* be implemented in `Microsoft::Terminal::Settings::Command`, and accept a `TerminalApp::Tabs`. This would be a layering violation. 
  - We could work around this by having our tabs expose something dumb like `Terminal::Settings::ITabInformation` and have `ExpandCommands` accept that instead.
    - this is the solution I'd be _least_ opposed to
* be implemented in `TerminalApp`, but then we wouldn't be able to inspect the implementation details of `Command`, which means we wouldn't be able to easily access the original json used for the command (which we need to be able to expand the command).
  - we could do something extra dumb like exposing the original json as a projected method on `Command`, but that's definitely silly

So I've pushed just this change to [`dev/migrie/f/6856-let-terminalpage-expandcommands`](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/compare/dev/migrie/f/command-palette-iterateOn...dev/migrie/f/6856-let-terminalpage-expandcommands?expand=1).

"@github has mentioned in the past that the latest Textmate grammars are scraped roughly once a month, so—correct me if I'm wrong, Alex—I believe no action is needed to get the upstream changes from Rust Syntax merged.  In the interim, you can use the Rust Syntax extension, which should play nicely with Rust Analyzer now that RA is not shipping a grammar. The Textmate scopes will only be visible with `""[rust]"": { ""editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled"": false }` in your `settings.json`, otherwise RA will override with semantic scopes.

Regarding #64488, I think it should probably be closed at this point. The grammar still needs minor improvements—which I am working on—but the essence of the issue has been fixed. In truth, most serious Rustaceans are using semantic highlighting via Rust Analyzer, but the current grammar provides reasonable default VS Code highlighting."
"After looking at it for a while, I think it's not worth it. We calculate the minimum size of each pane (and snap it to the text buffer grid) using pixels. We could probably rewrite all of that to just create a ratio. But that's risky and not really worth it.

"I'm slightly concerned about this, because synthesized code can contain explicit conversions, and NullableWalker can take such conversions and try to re-classify them, passing its `ExplicitCastInCode` value to `ClassifyConversion`'s `forCast` argument (indirectly). Then Conversions will say that the conversion doesn't exist. Wrong information could be propagated out, or unwanted diagnostics given. See #51631.

Basically, it's a rather small corner case, but I think if `ExplicitCastInCode` *requires* that a cast is present in user syntax, we may want a follow up item to make sure the NullableWalker avoids using it as an argument to `NullableWalker.GenerateConversion`, and to make sure that synthesized code never passes a 'true' value for this flag. Possibly with `Debug.Assert(!(WasCompilerGenerated && ExplicitCastInCode))` when creating a BoundConversion or something like that.

"@github good question :)

They are very common but _usually_ `bgen` (the binding generator) generates them for you (on every ObjC bindings), e.g. look into generated `src/build/ios/native/AVAsset.g.cs` and you see many lines like this one:

```csharp
[BindingImpl (BindingImplOptions.GeneratedCode | BindingImplOptions.Optimizable)]
```

This tells other tools (like the managed linker) that it was generated code (so we know how it looks in IL) and that it is safe to be optimized.

Some C-based API (like this one) are using _ObjC_ blocks (not C-function-based) callbacks (which are much easier to bind). Those API are bound manually (not using `bgen`) but `mtouch` still knows how to optimize them (because that block logic is identical with ObjC ones). In such case we _hint_ our tools that the code can be optimized by adding the attribute manually (obviously we don't pretend it's `GeneratedCode`, just `Optimizable`).

Finally our test suite do run tests with optimization enabled (so it's tested under both normal and optimized paths) and also detect if we have code that linker cannot remove (because some code lack the attribute to optimize them). IOW it's hard to get wrong and forget them :)"
"We don't.. but it is an error in the current implementation, and the [current proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/3a6c79012a8c53fe84330c09080105ac177ff93d/proposals/null-arg-checking.md) doesn't mention it.

            for (int i = nameParts.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            {

                expandedNamespace = expandedNamespace.GetMembers(nameParts[i]).OfType<NamespaceSymbol>().Single();
            }
```

Which is because `GetMembers(""System"")` returns zero items.

I've only been able to get this to crash in integreation tests like CSharpInteractive.BclConsoleCall.  I've really tried spelunking into the code here, but it all relates to things in the ReferenceManager and involve deep state manipulation in the core compilaiton/assembly that i really don't understand.  

Because this is repro'ing in interactive scenarios, my guess is that something in the compiler responsible for setting up symbols with submission-compilations is going wrong, and ends up with invalid internal state.  Unfortunately there are just so many parts to this in that layer that i have no idea what the actual problem is or where it starts from.

I would very much appreciate if i could get help with someone knowledgeable here about what is going wrong in the compiler that is causing a crash.  @github @github/roslyn-compiler who is a good source for info on Assembly-symbols, ReferenceManager and interactive?  Thanks!

Agree we shouldn't encourage it, but my point was with this approach a broken comparer produces correct code slowly, rather than wrong code quickly. "
"I've added tests, but they might be in the wrong place 😅 "
"> it looks the doc is wrong and this parameter is always out parameter

I think that comment is outdated.  The parameter is marked as in/out and it is used when the MUI_ALL_LANGUAGES flag is passed (which we do not pass)."
"> I would expect that conflict resolution would trim out the first pdb in favor of the second as that one comes via the runtime pack.

Conflict resolution doesn't look at ProjectReference output https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/2674.  This is related.  It looks like RAR is the one discovering the PDB:
```
Primary reference ""System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe, Version=6.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a"".
    Resolved file path is ""/__w/1/s/artifacts/bin/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe/net6.0-Release/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll"".
    Reference found at search path location ""/__w/1/s/artifacts/bin/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe/net6.0-Release/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll"".
    Found related file ""/__w/1/s/artifacts/bin/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe/net6.0-Release/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.pdb"".
    The ImageRuntimeVersion for this reference is """".
```
Then it gets added to `ReferenceCopyLocalPaths` along with the DLL since it comes from a ProjectReference, however `ReferenceCopyLocalPaths` was already conflict resolved by `_HandlePackageFileConflicts` *before* RAR, so it does not remove this .  Later on `_HandlePackageFileConflictsForPublish` runs but for some reason it looks like this isn't considering `ReferenceCopyLocalPaths`.  That seems wrong, since it used to handle this https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/84706598659a625b1ffaaea6665f22f4ce789433/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/build/Microsoft.NET.Publish.targets#L229

The binlog shows the `_ComputeResolvedCopyLocalPublishAssets` target running *after* `_HandlePackageFileConflictsForPublish` and appending to the input to conflict resolution `_ResolvedCopyLocalPublishAssets`.  This is a bug.  Conflict resolution should be seeing all the files that get copied to the output in order to do its job.  I think something is broken in the Target sequencing that is causing `_ComputeResolvedCopyLocalPublishAssets` to run after `_HandlePackageFileConflictsForPublish`, I see the same thing happening in a normal file-new-project-app.  @github 

"
"Ah, well, that was dumb. Hooray unit tests."
"First, a preface: I am by no means experienced with JIT dumps. But I took a stab at looking at a JIT dump of this pattern:

```C#
using System;

Console.WriteLine(new FooImpl().Bar());

interface IMarker {}

public abstract class FooBase {
    public virtual int Bar()
    {
        if (this is IMarker)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""marker"");
            return 1;
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""no marker"");
            return 1;
        }
    }
}

public sealed class FooImpl : FooBase, IMarker
{
}
```

At least on macOS ARM, I don't see the `this is IMarker` check get elided. It ends up as a helper call to `CORINFO_HELP_ISINSTANCEOFINTERFACE`.

```
IN0001: 00000C                    ldr     x1, [fp,#24]
IN0002: 000010                    movz    x0, #0xa600
IN0003: 000014                    movk    x0, #0x80e9 LSL #16
IN0004: 000018                    movk    x0, #2 LSL #32
IN0005: 00001C                    bl      CORINFO_HELP_ISINSTANCEOFINTERFACE
etc
```

I'm not sure how much we care, but it was a fun exercise.

@github I am marking this as ""ready"", but if we want to go back to overrides because we end up with interface checks, or if we can figure out how my testing was wrong, I am happy to adjust."

"> Any icalls we change the signature of like these need to have their name changed, because any third party callers (like blazor, uno etc) will crash or corrupt the heap by passing the wrong number of arguments (or reading a return value that isn't there). The convention I selected is a 'Ref' suffix at the end of the name for C#/C methods, and for JS methods either 'ref' (if they take a MonoObjectRef) or 'root' (if they take a WasmRoot)

"I guess my reasoning was that if we're trying to load a file, it seems like we should give the developer the option to open it in an external app/browser (i.e., we only load URLs in the view without invoking the `ExternalNavigationStarting` callback if they refer to other pages in the app). I could be making a wrong assumption here so I'm certainly happy to change it."

"I tried this at first, but got error. If I'm not wrong the reason is `Connection` is a default interface property and is implicit and here `Response.Headers` type is `HeaderCollection` and not `IHeaderDictionary`."

📝 Some changes snuck into the wrong commit here
"The ""runtime-ci"" link seems wrong, it actually goes to the ""old"" coreclr-ci build definition. Based on your below clarification that this is about the PR run, I assume this should rather be runtime-coreclr i.e. <code>definitionId=649</code>. Either that or just point out in the doc that this is currently in flux and needs updating once things settle down."
"I thought about discarding them but it _feels wrong_. You don't want to discard the disposer, you want to be explicitly aware of it's existence. 

That's just a personal opinion, however. "
"If this fails, the socket will be in a bad state. I'd rather we just let it throw.

That said, I don't know why this would fail as I'd expect socket duplication to not work if the address is wrong."
"Yes. `EatToken` will return the natural kind of the token, which, if it's a predefined type, will be of the wrong kind. We need to convert anything that isn't an `IdentifierToken` to a missing token, which `EatToken` will not do.

I'd say taking dependency on that behavior was wrong... Let's make it consistent and predictable
"We only get here with input parameters. `[NotNull]` takes a special meaning on inputs, namely ""the method will not return if the input is null"". This contract can only be represented with the `[NotNull]` attribute and cannot be represented with types. So we need the attribute regardless of substitution.

~~I'll double-check the behavior for `ref` scenarios. The `!forRef` check might be wrong.~~ The behavior of `[NotNull] ref` parameter is correct. There `[NotNull]` strictly has it's post-condition meaning. #Resolved"
"Given the code that uses this, if we get a null that means something went Really Terribly Wrong™. Can we just throw on null or annotate this particular one differently?"
"I feel like the marshaller bypasses ctors when it creates SafeHandles as a return value, (maybe I'm wrong and it just finds a ctor that looks like one it knows how to call? or maybe a default is required and I'm having a very bad recollection day).  I'm not sure this code actually prevents invalid handles.

A more canonical representation of this would be to declare the ldap_init call to return a SafeConnectionHandle (instead of IntPtr) and the caller should do

```C#
SafeConnectionHandle handle = LdapPal.Initialize(null, 389);
```

// In LdapPal.Windows.cs
```C#
internal static SafeConnectionHandle Initialize(string host, int port)
{
    SafeConnectionHandle handle = Interop.wldap32.ldap_init(host, port);

    if (handle.IsInvalid)
    {
        handle.Dispose();
        // this error handling code
    }

    return handle;

"I am not sure this is really much more complex when all is said and done, but I understand the concern.  

This is already parsing for `{@github}` so this is simply adding conditions to that same parsing which should not add much overhead unless it gets a match. Also, does this not only run on the `previewer.ts` context which would always get benefit from these changes?  Any time rendering preview hovers with markdown this would be useful and relative linking should be a benefit to all files and content regardless if they are Typescript.

The only real thing this adds would be beneficial 100% of the time in that case.  The parsing fixes `[](file://./)` linking and `file://./` linking in the markdown text.  Those are not Typescript-specific.

You should probably not support linking at all if it doesn't really work.  At least just ignore relative urls as well as {@github} because:

1. @github will never work when cmd+clicking them if they have a label since it will try to open the wrong url but in the hover it will be correct, which means the behavior is not only inconsistent but broken.
    - Another option is to not support the `|` syntax at all for link and just have the `{@github url this is the text}` which this PR does make work.
    - Only supporting `{@github https://www.google.com Google}` syntax also resolves the issue brought up in `contrib/links/links`. Only the fixes to allow `../` style relative linking would be needed there then.
2. relative urls will only work in some case, but not most such as `../` or when rendered from another path in the project.
3. file:// urls also do not work currently when relative and using @github 
4. file:// urls will never work when using markdown `[test](file://./plugins.ts)`
5. file:// urls will never work with fragments - which this does not really make more complex to support `file://./plugins.ts#3,6`

Probably should just remove relative link support completely so-as not to cause problems since at the moment it will fail almost 100% of the time."

"Thank youf again for working on this. 
I'm sorry for adding even more confusion, but I don't think we should fix it like this.
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the most common scenario during the transfer of baggage is something like this:
```CSharp
foreach (var item in baggage)
{
    activity.AddBaggage(item.Name, item.Value);
}
``` 
Here a sample of how Kestrel doing this: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c97a0020d8bab6d895bf821f6e47ee8722aa17d5/src/Hosting/Hosting/src/Internal/HostingApplicationDiagnostics.cs#L276

This means that with this change if before the transfer we had baggage like this
```
Key1=NewValue;Key1=OldValue
```
After transfer that would be:
```
Key1=OldValue;Key1=NewValue
```
So the result of `GetBaggageItem` will be changing on each transfer and would be totally unpredictable (Or we would need to require reversal of the baggage collection before adding that is very unintuitive)

This is what actually happening now in net core 3.1 and at lease from my point of view it's better to have a change in behavior then changes in order between transfers.

Alternatively, you could change `GetBaggageItem` method itself to return the last item with that key in the list, but that would mean fully iterating over the list each time (or making list double-linked), so I'm not sure if it worth it.

I do know how complicated is the process of exposing new public method is for your team, but in terms of our use case having something like `SetBaggageItem()` or `RemoveBaggageItem()` would solved all of the problems and it would've allowed to avoid all of the problematic cases discassed here. I don't think somebody actually want's two items with the same key (or if they do they could work with `Baggage` enumeration), but it's quite posible and easy to call `Add` twice in diffirent places or have the need to update value. 

Having the ability to update the list, you could always suggest people use it instead of `Add` when they are facing simular problems and it will prevernt inceasing baggage size when it's not needed."

">ContainingType [](http://example.com/codeflow?start=18&length=14)

it looks like I was wrong and we shouldn't recurse into the containing type here given that base implementation doesn't do that. There is also an explicit comment about that there:
```
            // When we are binding a name with a nested type, Goo.Bar, then we ask for
            // use-site errors to be reported on both Goo and Goo.Bar. Therefore we should
            // not recurse into the containing type here; doing so will result in errors
            // being reported twice if Goo is bad.
``` #Closed"
"add `[DisableDefaultCtor]` here since
* it's not used anywhere;
* the base type is abstract without an `init`
* we can remove it (it's not a breaking change) if we're wrong"
"I wrote that rule :)  A diagnostic means that the tree is not valid in some fashion.  Indeed, that's precisely what the incremental parser uses to make this determination.  So the presence of a diagnostic saying ""you're using the wrong lang version"" ends up impacting all higher up versions which then interpret this as ""there is a problem fitting the text to the syntax model"".  

In this case this is purely a semantic check.  The tree is 100% syntactically valid (definitionally so), but there is an ambient external check that impacts it (specifically the idea of a lang-version).  This also violates the other syntactic rule i specified which is:

> The parser should, as much as possible, be context-free. 

this makes parsing not context free.  In order to parse you have to pass additional context in as it affects the nodes that you might produce.  This also means that if you change compiler, you have to reparse everything (which really doesn't make much sense since the text is all the same, and as such the syntactic structure is truly the same).

Where we have bent this a bit is with record-parsing, where there truly is a different in syntactic structure produced based on options.  But outside of that, where we generate teh same trees otherwise, putting version diagnostics in the parser violates these design principles. "

Basically, for `ishst`, loads can still be reordered around barrier and hence it is weaker than the `ishld` where loads/stores need to wait till the barrier is complete.

If we change from full barrier to `ishst`, we might have a load that should have been completed but got reordered and might end up reading the wrong value (pre-updated value). Is my understanding correct?

The ""right"" fix would be to special case `get_IsHardwareAccelerated` around  here: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/coreclr/jit/hwintrinsic.cpp#L288-L292

"Finding ""Task"" when someone writes ""ContinueWith"" is akin to us finding types like `List<T>` when the user types ""foo.Count"".  I think it could be hugely useful.  But it needs to be done properly.  i.e. we should actually be finding types that contain that member and not just saying ""i'm _somewhere deep in an await_ ergo, my type is the same as the contextual type the await would find"".   

To be clear:

`string s = await Foo().ContinueWith(list => list.Count.ToString())`

It is simply wrong for us to say that ""Foo()"" is a `Task<string>`.  The only reason this was ok in the test was because the test was contrived.  It happened to be ok in this one case.  But htat's like saying:   ""string s = x.y.z.Florb()"" and saying that x, y, or z should have the ""string"" type.  It's just taking a type we see and drawing a very erroneous conclusion about it.

Similarly, if you had ""if (a.b)"" then ""b"" should have type 'bool', but 'a' should have nothing inferred about it**.

Up until #643 was ""fixed"" teh type inference service operated in a very considered and careful manner.  It infers types when there is a genuine connection between things.  i.e. if i have ""string s = a.b.c"" then ""c"" def can be inferred to have the ""string"" type.  similarly ""string s = await foo"" or ""string s = await foo.ConfigureAwait()"".  in both these cases 'foo' can be inferred to have type string.  

## 

*\* in the future it would be nifty to say ""try to find a type that has a 'b' on it, and pick something suitable"".  Until then though, i don't want this bad inference code in the type inferrer.

"@github I now fixed all failing tests. By unifying the file banner parsing (relies only on `SyntaxFacts.GetFileBanner` now), I needed to find a middle ground in keeping existing behavior, fixing bugs, dropping features, and unifying behavior (this lead to a lot of changes, so the PR also contains lot's of refactorings of the existing code now, which makes it hard to review).

The most notable change I have done so far is the changes to `AbstractSyntaxFacts.GetFileBanner`. I essentially added support for leading whitespace, end of line, and preprocessor directives (e.g. to support `#region header` around the banner). This method was used by a bunch of other analyzers/fixers (see https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/49440#issuecomment-731590060). I needed to fix one test case after the change in `MisplacedUsingDirectivesInCompilationUnitCodeFixProviderTests`, but I think the behavior was wrong before and is right now.

Most adoptions to the new behavior in FileHeaderTests are also improvements IMO. I needed to drop support for block comments with missing end token, though.

`AbstractFileHeaderHelper` is only a shadow of its former self. I think it can be completely inlined now. What do you think about that?

What should we do with respect file banners in the editorconfig in XML doc comment style? Should those be allowed or should these be treated as text (editorconfig: `/// Some xml doc comment`  -> `// /// Some xml doc comment`)?

I still have to write some more tests, but a review of the current changes would be appreciated."
"@github @github There are actually several issues being debated here:
- Circularities occurring because we're more eager than we need to when _resolving_ (as opposed to _checking_) the type of an expression. As Jason points out, that's not a new issue. We could make progress on this issue by making a distinction between _resolving_ and _checking_ an expression, and only evaluate as much as we need to when resolving. Indeed, we could solve the actual cases in the compiler by doing this for type assertion expressions.
- Inability for symbols to have evolving _declared_ types. This one is much harder. I really don't want to go there unless we absolutely have to.
- Compute _narrowed_ types by iterating to a fixed point. We only do this in limited form today and, as Wes' example shows, we may need to do more here. I'm not super concerned with crazy examples that walk up a ladder of overloads, but I can indeed imagine real world examples where it occurs without overloading. Although I haven't actually seen any in the wild yet. I will continue to think about this issue.

We really should not be crossgenning an `SseImpl` method for arm64 as it can never be called on that platform, and the method assumes SSE support. But we do anyways. Because we're compiling this SSE method for arm64 most of the basic inlines fail as the inliner sees these methods will throw:

Currently, failed ""does not return"" inline methods don't result in control flow dead ends . So these all look like normal calls in the root method that might return. As a result we have a ton of call-crossing vector lifetimes and are giving the upper save/restore logic a good workout.

I don't know yet if crossgenning this method is an artifact of running cross crossgen (that is, I am running a crossgen hosted on x64 here) or a ""feature"".

I wonder if the `SseImpl` version should have another `IsSupported` check guarding some sort of not supported on this platform throw...?

"That depends on the relationship between the `outDir` of the importing file and the `outDir` of the imported file. Consider this non-monorepo project references scenario:

```

out/

    index.d.ts
  b/
    index.js
    index.d.ts

Because the `outDir`s of the two projects have the same relationship as the `rootDir`s, it’s safe and conventional to write imports from `a` to `b` as `import { B } from ""../b"";`. But as of #37482, you get two suggestions:

I think that was also the case before this PR.

"It is not functionally wrong to do this, even if there was a concatenation, because we remove it again in the lowering of the coalescing operator. I noticed this technique is used in lot's of places. (For example, the lowering of a non-binary string concatenation builds lot's of intermediary structures that are broken down again when lowering a higher level.) So I used the same technique here to clean up the code considerably. Also, notice that the unit tests all still pass, nothing has changed there.

Sure.  Though it would be good to just fix both now since hte bug reports are about the crash:

"The only time SkipValue can fail is when the content is corrupt and moving forward again would not succeed.

It should generally be true that calling the wrong read method does not corrupt the reader (or, if you prefer, any wrong read call utterly destroys the reader).

"> Does this change cause some expressions that used to be considered constant to no longer be considered constant?

Not really. We wouldn't get here if an expression was considered a constant. See the comment right below ```Case BoundKind.BinaryOperator``` and, based on review of the algorithm, I think it is accurate. Given that, unless there is a bug similar to the one I am fixing, an error is going to be reported anyway. What we could end up with before is that, despite an error, a ```ConstantValue``` for a left operand of a binary operator could be returned. That value, clearly, doesn't represent the result of a binary operator itself and perhaps could have wrong type. That probably could affect what our internal structures hold and the constant value that SemanticModel or a symbol reports, but I do not consider that a breaking change. Compiler simply becomes more ""accurate"" in error scenarios.

3. But my return type is a string literal union, so why not just return another string? It's going to be checked precisely anyway. And it'll be slightly more efficient and explicit.

As you are adding public API into CoreCLR specific implementation you need to add same public API to Mono's specific System.Private.CoreLib -- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/mono/netcore/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/GC.Mono.cs.

It would be very nice to have either the ability to suppress this specific error only in source (i.e. #19139) or globally.

"> Do we agree that the test is definitely wrong?

Not sure.  There are plenty of situations where one disposable type wrapping another disposable type doesn't do anything in its Dispose except call Dispose on the wrapped instance, and Dispose is idempotent, so it's acceptable use.  There are also cases where objects are ref counted, e.g. with SafeHandle, and the wrapper would have taken a ref on the wrapped thing such that disposing the wrapped thing wouldn't have actually closed the wrapped thing until after everything was disposed and released ref counts.  I don't know what category these fall into nor what guarantees we've made in docs... but it seems like this works on Windows?

> if it's possible for libgdiplus to detect that it's being used incorrectly

My confusion is that the APIs being used here are managed.  Misuse of a managed API shouldn't cause a seg fault / crash.  If it's actually misuse, worst case it should throw an exception.  e.g. if I misuse FileStream, it shouldn't crash the process (even though FileStream P/Invokes as an implementation detail), worst case a use-after-dispose would produce an ObjectDisposedException.  So I'm trying to understand what makes this special; it's possible there some aspect of this I'm just missing that makes it different :)"

The `AvoidRestoreCycleOnSelfReference` workaround was causing
DiagnosticSource to get the wrong PackageID in the assets file when
referenced by other projects.  This wasn't a problem when using pkgproj
since we'd calculate dependencies from assembly references, ignoring
the assets file.  This is a problem now that we're using csproj pack,
since that gets dependencies from the assets file.

"@github thank you for providing the details.
@github let me give you some more info on the ""this"" pointer alignment issue. We have an in-memory data structure that's loaded from disk or generated. Items of the problematic type are correctly aligned, however when we are computing an address of such an element, we were using an unaligned pointer and then aligning it. We are walking that in-memory structure and locating elements in there. When we move past the previous element, we can get an unaligned pointer for some previous element's size. What we were doing wrong was that we have first cast the pointer to a data structure that needs 8 byte alignment and then called its member method that aligned ""this"" and returned the aligned result for further use. With this fix, we align the pointer (which is a BYTE*) first and then cast it to the specific type that needs the alignment."

"Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like as long as any 'fix' is present, we're returning 'ErrorFix' as one of the categories with applicable actions.

Based on the mappings in the IDE :

- ErrorFix maps to the 'error' lightbulb icon
- CodeFix maps to the 'default' lightbulb icon

Therefore, if 1 or more fixes are applicable, the error lightbulb icon will always be displayed on mouse hover over squiggle, or on set caret position.

The thing to keep in mind is that the lightbulb API 1) calls GetSuggestedActionCategoriesAsync(), picks the category of highest precedence, and then displays the icon for that category. On lightbulb expansion with Ctrl+. however the lightbulb displays the icon for the highest precedence category name in the list of SuggestedActionsSets."

"We have an application which works with different servers using some protocol X. End users are interested in working with the only server at the same time. Usually the user doesn’t even have an access to several servers. So some users work with server1, other users work with server2, etc.

On the app side we have a health check to monitor the state of each server. The server server1 might be Healthy, server2 - Unhealthy and server3 - Degraded. It is absolutely okay because we don’t control the servers (they are external third party resources). Some of them are actually just demo servers so that they are often down. We also have an application-wide check to monitor the app itself. There we check the things which are not related to the servers directly, e.g. databases on our side. But we also include the servers to that app-wide check so that if all the servers are Unhealthy, then the app is Unhealthy too because we don’t expect such situation and most probably something is wrong on the app side. Anyway, even if everything is fine with the service itself we still want a notification that nobody is able to use the service. But the thing is that the default logic results Unhealthy when at least one check (e.g. server2) is Unhealthy.

Eventually, we use a workaround which works normal enough. I don’t think that our specific case is enough reason to change the framework behavior. I just found that kind of flexibility useful for the community. I can imagine some other calculation logic in other apps. That’s why I created the PR."

I guess my reservation about ignoring those attributes is based on my understanding of how Intellisense should work (I might very well be wrong, so please correct me if that's the case), which is it should at least provide every valid type that can be typed here.

"I see how I caused this confusion by wrongly naming SignedSatQ(SignedWideType val, out UnsignedNarrowType result) instead of UnsignedSatQ. The underlying implementation was correct, so the tests passed - the helper name was wrong :-)

In fact, I found that we only need the following three helpers:
- SignedSatQ(SignedWideType val, out SignedNarrowType result)
- UnsignedSatQ(SignedWideType val, out UnsignedNarrowType result)
- UnsignedSatQ(UnsignedWideType val, out UnsignedNarrowType result)

I added SatQ helper as defined in the Arm specification and used it instead of SignedSatQ/UnsignedSatQ to make the implementation looks closer to the *""gold standard""*.

However, since we decided to provide right logical shifts overloads for signed types - I had to extend SatQ helper operating on signed arguments in the way allowing reinterpretation of the incoming signed values as unsigned that helps avoiding doing multiple casting in different helpers.

I pushed the change to Helpers.tt Helpers.cs - it makes sense to look at the former only."

I agree with that.  I also think it's not worth adding if it only does some of what you asked it to do and happily returns false with no additional information.  If we want to throw an exception after it's completed copying whatever it can, that's fine; the API review discussed either throwing the first exception or the last exception or an aggregate... any of those seems better than returning false (though with an aggregate I'd worry about memory impact if lots of things in the copy failed)."

Removing an instruction from the middle of a group would be much more difficult than this because any later instructions would need to be moved back up which would invalidate references to them. Specifically removing only the very last instruction is relatively safe because it can only affect the references to that value, and as you see I made sure to zero it in checked builds so that if anything touches that instruction once it has been removed it will get invalid data and usually hit an assert.

The toolchain has no knowledge of what RID's are ""valid"" for a particular framework, it just provides runtimeTargets in case they might be used.  On .NETCore it's the host's decision to decide if it happens to use one of those (based on the RID fallback graph it has for the particular runtime it's running on).  Package testing is trying to make sure that any asset that ""might"" apply for any RID meets our test criteria.

@github I think mixing platform conditions (TPI + Targets*) is more confusing than applying platform conditions with the TPI property only (even though inheritance isn't supported with TPI and they might be more verbose). Imagine the following case:

A project has platform specific properties and items:
```
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFrameworks>$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-windows;$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-Linux;$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-OSX</TargetFrameworks>
</PropertyGroup>

<!-- DesignTimeBuild requires all the TargetFramework Derived Properties to not be present in the first property group. -->
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetPlatformIdentifier>$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)'))</TargetPlatformIdentifier>
  <GeneratePlatformNotSupportedMessage Condition=""'$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'windows'"">...</GeneratePlatformNotSupportedMessage>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup Condition=""'$(TargetsUnix)' == 'true'"">
  <Compile Include=""..."" />
</ItemGroup>
```

vs.

```
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFrameworks>$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-windows;$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-Linux;$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-OSX</TargetFrameworks>
</PropertyGroup>

<!-- DesignTimeBuild requires all the TargetFramework Derived Properties to not be present in the first property group. -->
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetPlatformIdentifier>$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)'))</TargetPlatformIdentifier>
  <GeneratePlatformNotSupportedMessage Condition=""'$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'windows'"">...</GeneratePlatformNotSupportedMessage>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup Condition=""'$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'Linux' or '$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'OSX'"">
  <Compile Include=""..."" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Today only two `Targets*` properties which support inheritance exist (`TargetsUnix` and `TargetsLinux` for Android) and only very few projects depend on that feature. If we think that this change makes the projects that leverage this feature unreadable, we could define such a helper property per project in a property group so that it can be used both for property and item conditions. That said, based on what I saw while making these changes, I don't think that's necessary.

Another fundamental problem with the libraries specific `Targets*` properties is that they have a totally different meaning than the `Targets*` properties that are repo-wide defined, i.e. `TargetsMobile`. The former is inferred from the TargetFramework and hence means the platform that the target framework targets. The latter is inferred from the TargetOS and is just a shorthand form for `' $(TargetOS)' == '...'` conditions. Because of their equal prefix, people used them equally even though they mean something totall different. 
As an example here's one of such mistakes in main today: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/1c80769c0d6e2241cd8a3eeb17cab306d0954d1f/src/libraries/System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters/src/System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.csproj#L12-L14 This condition is only true when the `TargetOS` is one of the mobile OSs but not when the target framework platform is a mobile one. That means that if you compile this library i.e. on a Windows OS the condition will be false vs. when you compile the library on a mobile OS."

It would be much clearer if all the entries were present all the time, but if you picked a type that can't be found, we have an error message like ""The type {name} could not be found. It might not be supported when running on this host environment."". This error could be triggered from `Index.razor`'s `SelectedComponentType` getter, or just inline in the Razor UI logic when `SelectedComponentTypeName` is nonempty but `SelectedComponentType` is null.

Also rather than using assembly qualified names, what stops it from working just having the type name (independently of the assembly)? The logic in `Index.razor`'s `SelectedComponentType` uses `Type.GetType` - doesn't that look at all the loaded assemblies?"

The core of the change is just the file provider. The rest is tests (around 30 or so for the file provider at least) and a few workaround we had to implement before https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/19080 goes in.

We already inserted the SDK changes last week and these changes are the follow-up to consume those changes in the runtime. There is a flag to turn static web assets off and there is also a flag to fallback on to the old version if needed, so we have plenty of options if something goes wrong.

Which while it can happen because I'm not an all omniscient being, we have plenty of tests on the repo that would break if there is an issue here.

For some places we do throw an `InvalidOperationException` but the problem is the exception message is a different place to place, so if we use our new extension method, then everywhere the same exception message will be thrown and it will be a breaking change for users!

We need to do some testing of some significant pastes.  Here's why:  GetTextChanges is not guaranteed to offer any particular behavior.  It may sometimes say that the entire file changed, or it may do a bad diff that ends up with some crazy changes.  There are issues tracking this, but i can't find them.

So, basically, you're calling this assuming you'll get a nice minimal edit back stating which import was added.  But i don't know if you can trust that will happen.  And then, if you have weird stuff (like overlapping changes) i have no idea what blows up later.  This is a definite concern for me."

"> Better to only support the core pieces we can reason about and make promises about from a scale perspective, and then in the future if necessary consider loosening those constraints.

If you feel like there are too many unknowns to do this reasonably well then I am fine with this, but it sucks from a usability perspective.

Are we optimizing for the right user here?

We initially talked about adding this API for the rare user who wants perf/scalability but also wants sync, but I suspect (strongly hope) that this is actually a small group. I expect the biggest user of this to be the one who doesn't care about or doesn't understand scalability, and wants something that ""just works"". If the API has a bunch of non-corner cases where it throws, then this is far from ""just works"" and fails those users.

Perhaps we should rethink the API, making it harder to find (maybe require reflection?) so that you'd only ever use it if you are in the 1st scenario, not the 2nd."

"This specific case is not a good example of how the annotations should work. But let's assume the debugger is somewhere in managed code in the app - so something has a reference to the `ProxyTypeName` property and presumably it does something like:
``` C#
var propertiesToShow = Type.GetType(attr.ProxyTypeName).GetProperties();
```

When linker sees that it goes (basically backwards):
* I need all properties on the type returned by Type.GetType (cause there's a call to GetProperties() on it)
* So it means that the type name coming to Type.GetType must be a type with all properties
* So it means I need the attr.ProxyTypeName to be a type name with all properties -> it should have at least `DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicProperties)`.
* If it doesn't -> warn
* So we go and annotate the `ProxyTypeName` with that annotation
* Now running the linker again it will not warn on the usage above anymore, but it will warn in the attribute's .ctor since we're trying to assign an unannotated string to the backing field of `ProxyTypeName`
* So we go and fix that by annotating the `.ctor` argument.
* Running linker again it will not warn in the `.ctor` itself, but it now requires all the callers to fulfill that annotation. But since this is an attribute all callers provide constant strings as the argument - for this linker knows what to do, it finds the type of that name, keeps it and then also keeps all of its properties.

So for the application to work - only the last step is needed, for which only the annotation on the .ctor argument is needed. But that would not be enough for linker to figure out that the code using it is correct - and so it would have to warn (it doesn't do cross method analysis). So the other annotations, like the one on the property, are there to help linker prove that the code is correct and that it will work.

The other advantage is that if later on we change the usage and now call for example `.GetProperties(BindingFlags.NonPublic)`, linker would suddenly warn, because the annotations don't cover private properties anymore and the app may break. Without the annotations flowing through everything it would have no way to tell that there's something wrong.

The reason why the annotations are the same everywhere is that they always mean the same thing - it's a requirement on the value which is passed in. That can be fulfilled either by:
* passing in value with same or ""bigger"" annotation
* passing in statically known value which the linker can actually find - and then it can make sure that type in question fulfills the requirements

Since the method/property itself doesn't which one of the two cases it will be, it applies the annotation - always the same one."

"@github thanks a lot for working on this. I like the changes and I think the flow makes sense.
What I do not like is the fact that this introduces a lot of new code, I understand that it might not have been possible to do it any other way, but just looking at it these are 200 new lines for this ""simple"" feature.
I understand that it might not sound like a lot, but maintaining this code might be the problem going forward for me since I was not the author.

Bottom line: I like the work, but if we could simplify it somehow would make my decision to merge much easier.
This way I plan to review it in more details next week or the week after.

"This looks wrong, the `#if` just above means this line isn't compiled for watchOS. Maybe the `#if` needs updating?"
I don't think we need to pretend we know what is wrong. A simple error message that file xyz could not be loaded would work
It would be better if instead of `IsAny` you matched the values it should receive to be sure we for example don't send in wrong deviceName or something.
I'm not crazy about it... Especially because I need to match up the variable with the value on the right-hand side to see what its default value is.

99.9999% of our customer don't use Platform variants either ;) We made it the default for these 2 benchmarks as it makes them faster, so this is what we are setting on TE and what we are tracking. The middleware variants don't have this flag, so do not the other Platform ones.

I still want to track this one since it's the one we'll submit to TE if it's faster, but if you prefer them to be without this ENV by default I can add the special ones as a new scenario name also in the charts. "

I guess that most likely the problem is that this is a ""forced Crossgen2"" test and if the test does something like ildasm followed by ilasm, applying that to a R2R executable certainly won't produce an identical result."

<hr />

I was looking at what events & counters may be useful to add to connection pooling (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/66605#discussion_r828305848).

For some things, it would be useful to have a reference to every `HttpConnectionPoolManager` in the process.
Having such a list would make it possible to improve a few things:
- Reduce per-request overhead of tracking stats like `http11-requests-in-queue`
  - Doing such tracking inline during the request isn't prohibitively expensive though
- Simplify the cleaning & heartbeat timer logic across pools
  - A single timer can be used for the whole process, instead of toggling timers per manager instance
- Simplify the `NetworkChange` notifications
  - A single notification is sufficient for all managers, avoiding the added logic around the callback registration cleanup
- Simplify other per-pool timer mechanisms
  - Recent example of issues that come along with that: #66782
- We avoid tracking some things like `http11-connections-current-total` when telemetry is disabled. As a result, you will see wrong values if you turn telemetry on later on during the process's lifetime.
  - With a global list, we can always know the correct value

This PR adds such a collection `HttpConnectionPoolManager.AllManagers`, uses a global timer for cleanup & heartbeats and a single `NetworkChange` callback.

Cases where this approach may have a higher overhead:
- You have A LOT of `SocketsHttpHandler` instances that are completely idle (without a single pool)
- You have a lot of handler instances, but your cleaning/heartbeat intervals are really high, making the 1 Hz scanning more expensive

Opening as a draft to gather feedback on whether we think such a change is a horrible idea.

"Any icalls we change the signature of like these need to have their name changed, because any third party callers (like blazor, uno etc) will crash or corrupt the heap by passing the wrong number of arguments (or reading a return value that isn't there). The convention I selected is a 'Ref' suffix at the end of the name for C#/C methods, and for JS methods either 'ref' (if they take a MonoObjectRef) or 'root' (if they take a WasmRoot)"
"> These asserts are generic signs of GC heap corruption. A bug introduced in common parts (e.g. parsing/formatting) can lead to intermittent crash like that.

I'd speculate there may be another issue with `Unsafe.As` then and there is still something wrong with https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/69204/commits/7666952d06c1280d0f0c8c117d599a76df4c0a8d

"> If we're planning on handling this as an ""internal"" navigation attempt, we'll also have to confirm that PDFs are supported on webviews across all platforms. Not a big deal, but just calling it out.

Do you think it would be fine to just load all ""internal"" URLs in the webview by default? If the developer can override this behavior, it seems to me like it would be overreaching a bit to decide which file types we should and shouldn't load in the webview by default (but I could be wrong about this)."

"OK, I've been looking into this, and was able to reproduce the problem with fractional heights by using the following test case in `FetchData.ts`:

```razor
@github (forecasts == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <div style=""overflow-y: auto; height: 200px; border: 1px solid red;"">
        <Virtualize Items=""forecasts"" Context=""forecast"">
            <div style=""border: 0.2px solid green"" @github=""forecast"">
                <span>@github.Date.ToShortDateString()</span>
                <span>@github.TemperatureC</span>
                <span>@github.TemperatureF</span>
                <span>@github.Summary</span>
            </div>
        </Virtualize>
    </div>
}
```

I also changed the underlying data source to supply 500 items. Without your fix that uses `getBoundingClientRect`, the behavior goes wrong when scrolling quickly because it misjudges its location within the scroll range because the rounding errors add up. In the example above, it just stops adding new items after a certain point, so the user scrolls into a blank white region.

Then, after adding your fix that uses `getBoundingClientRect`, the problem goes away. I could no longer repro any weirdness in the above example.

So, my remaining two questions are:

 * **Why would it be better to use the developer's own provided `ItemSize` value?** It's hard to see how the developer would be able to give a more accurate value than you're calculating at the subpixel level. Your value is more accurate than what's displayed in the browser dev tools, which round to 2dp.
    * Do you have any repro scenario where things still go wrong after applying the `getBoundingClientRect` fix?
 * **Do we care about supporting the case where the developer fails to provide `@github`?** I found that, if not providing that, the scrolling sometimes goes mad and continues scrolling even after I release the mouse wheel. It's a bit worrying because I don't have an exact reason for why it happens or why `@github` fixes it, or if there might be some case where `@github` doesn't fix it.
    * My best guess is there may be some heuristic within the browser whereby when using wheel scrolling (or perhaps with drag scrolling too), it picks an end point that lines up with one of the existing elements, and continues scrolling until that point is reached. But if we're not using `@github`, then it never reaches that point because we keep moving the target element further in the direction you're already scrolling. If this guess is correct, it explains why `@github` fixes it (because the target element gets removed from the DOM and the process ends). However this guess doesn't predict any good solution other than `@github`.
      * For my own future reference: we did consider forcing the equivalent of `@github` by wrapping each item inside a region with sequence number given by the index into the collection. However this behaves badly if items are inserted/removed, as it incorrectly would match/mismatch items against the earlier output. So it's better to force developers to give a `@github` manually corresponding to the actual collection entry or its ID.
    * Personally I think we could consider it a reasonable requirement that you must use `@github` for good performance and reliable scrolling. Certainly it's the most common case. It would just be great if we could avoid the weirdness in the non-key case too, or somehow detect the failure to use `@github`, but don't have a good suggestion for doing either right now.

This is definitely wrong.
">Dim identifier = SyntaxFactory.IdentifierName(NameOf(Enumerable.Cast)) [](start = 24, length = 70)

This looks wrong, I don't believe VB ever uses Cast to convert to the type stated in the As clause. It is used only as an attempt to convert collection to queryable type and only with object as type argument. Several methods can be implicitly called on the collection, sometimes in a sequence, look at CollectionRangeVariableSymbolInfo structure. All information from that structure is sufficient and required to properly do the translation. No need to look at the syntax to check whether it has As clause or not."

"Note: i still stand by that statement.  We should not be adding lots of complexity to features to handle a 0.0001% case.

In htat regard, this PR is really helping out this feature.  It goes from being a basic ""i only support inversion in this one basic case"" to ""i support so many common flow control patterns"".  We shoudl not make that job much more difficult to just to support some esoteric cases that were literally dreamt up by a genius dev who loved finding these sorts of crazy cases for fun, but which don't actually come in in the real world :)"

">return this.WrappedSymbol.GetHashCode(); [](start = 16, length = 40)

nit: This _seems_ wrong but I don't have a good argument for why yet. Just a code smell. I don't suppose we can use `System.HashCode.Combine(this.Nullability, this.WrappedSymbol)`? "
"Its more subtle than that.

The default baseline instruction set is Sse, Sse2. However, the jit compiler is told to generate code assuming that it may use Sse, Sse2, Sse3, Ssse3, Sse41, Sse42, Lzcnt, Popcnt, and Pclmqdq. But if the compiler actually uses any of Sse3, Ssse3, Sse41, Sse42, Lzcnt, Popcnt, or Pclmqdq it will notify the crossgen2 managed code. That notification feeds into this logic and if so, we will then mark the method such that the generated code can only be used if the actual hardware supports the instruction set. That's all well and good, and considering that just about all hardware does support these instruction sets, we get crossgen R2R to generate ideal code for all these cases.

The less optimal case is where code attempts to use an Avx, or Avx2 feature, or such. In thoses cases, we will generate code as if the processor does NOT support the feature. In corelib, the idea is that we will audit our code reviews such that such a decision does not make the logic wrong (just slow) (This code auditing is already necessary for our current crossgen1 intrinsics support for corelib), but in the general case we cannot assume that the code will behave correctly if it runs on hardware that does support Avx, Avx2, etc. In that case, what this logic does is record the decision that Avx use was attempted and forbidden. Then the generated code will not be used at runtime, and the JIT will be invoked, if the hardware actually supports Avx/Avx2.

In addition, the --instruction-set argument allows adjusting the baseline instruction set. For instance, if the compiler is run with --instruction-set Sse42, --instruction-set Popcnt --instruction-set Lzcnt, --instruction-set Pclmqdq, then this logic will never kick in, and do anything, as the generated code will never exceed that of the baseline. "
"> I thought we were also parsing in class declarations for error recovery. Is that wrong?

We don't parse statements within a class or a namespace declaration.

"Did the fixer make this change?  It appears to be getting the whitespace ""wrong""; we should validate that trivia is being handled correctly."
"It's based on Dan's numbers for both the downclocking impact (perhaps 30% over 700 microseconds or ~200 microseconds), and the speed advantage for AVX512F over AVX2 (about 400 microseconds at 128*1024). Dan's speed numbers are for relatively low clock rate machines (2.8 and 2.1 GHz), so I think on current hardware, the time difference may be lower due to higher clock rates on both.

I think it's just a rough estimate, but not very wrong.

"This distorts results, for two reasons:

 1. The bitwise-and, possibly in an attempt to make the range positive, subtly distorts the number of results, due to there being one more negative number than there are positive (~~or two, if~~ because `long.MaxValue` is never returned).  If  `FullLong()` returned the correct range, the bitwise-and should be unnecessary.
 1. The modulus operator distorts the results, because usually `maxValue` will not be an integral factor of the range of the random.  [See this for a discussion, and the potential fix if modulus will continue to be used](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10984974/why-do-people-say-there-is-modulo-bias-when-using-a-random-number-generator).

This will become a worse issue in C# 7, when we expect to have variables introduced in any statement that has a subexpression (e.g. declaration expressions or pattern matching). At that time I would expect this code to require revision. Better to attach a syntax node that has the right extent to start with.

The display class created for the foreach control variable _could be_ shared with the closure for any variables declared in the controlled statement. But it _could not be_ the same as for any variables declared in the expression of the foreach loop.

Rerunning crossgen (w/ readytorun flag) on the armel device fixed this. There are similar issues with AspnetCore.  I had to put the libraries though crossgen on an armel device to make them work w/o odd managed exceptions.  Makes sense with Aspnet as armel doesnt seem to be a supported arch in the build process.  I'm out of my depth on this, but I suspect crossgen might be generating armhf readytorun.

"I think I will just modify this PR with the plan we decide on.

My understanding of the plan, please correct me if I'm wrong:

1. We leave a ""LibraryBuild"" warning in DependencyInjection that has a good warning message explaining that open generic types can be broken. Maybe even putting an `aka.ms` link to a doc explaining the situation.
2. We add a new runtime check to DependencyInjection that verifies when open generic types are used, they have matching `[DAM]` annotations to the generic types.
    a. The check is only enabled when a new AppContext switch (`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.VerifyOpenGenericServiceTrimmability`) is set. By default it isn't set.
3. We enable `VerifyOpenGenericServiceTrimmability` when `PublishTrimmed=true` on the project.

We are recommending that app devs set `PublishTrimmed=true` in their .csproj when they plan on trimming their apps. That way feature switches like BuiltInCOMInterop are configured correctly even when F5 Debugging their untrimmed apps. And the analyzer runs during their build. `VerifyOpenGenericServiceTrimmability` is just another setting that gets defaulted with PublishTrimmed. That way devs will see any errors even before trimming their apps."
"> They look like infrastructure failures, or failures stemming from infrastructure failures.

This is a limitation of the WinUI DatePicker; it can only restrict the selectable years: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.datepicker?view=winui-3.0#date-values

So the best we can do out of the box is set MinYear and MaxYear. Hopefully at some point we can include [support for the CalendarDatePicker](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/1092), where MinimumDate/MaximumDate is more useful.

"Is this faster than `foreach (var result in results)` because it skips something like checking-whether-the-list-was-modified on each read?

If so, then as a meta-point about this feature itself rather than your use of it here, it seems like a weird way of expressing the intent because there's nothing obvious in the naming of `CollectionsMarshal.AsSpan` that implies this, or provides any indication of what would go wrong if the assumption turned out to be false.

"Fantastic, this PR adds just the thing I was looking for :D

"I realize that this approach fails as well. Since the the x64 and and x86 builds happen in the same pipeline, we _**cheat**_ by only building native assets once for all platforms as part of just the x64 build.

Since we're building ARM64 in a separate pipeline that won't work.  Building the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS` package has native deps which relies on the native build having already run.

I can only think of some crazy ideas to fix this. I assume the build team wouldn't be happy with any of my suggestions 🤣 
- Move the entire ARM64 build into same pipeline as x64/x86
- RID-split the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS` package and build each rid in it's own pipeline"

"@github thanks a lot for this awesome PR, overall great work, I really like it!

* Can you please list all the colors you have added since we will have to name them correctly and @github can help here. Also list the comments you did which each color please.
* Did you verify that your changes do not break debug coloring across: debug views, debug console, debug hover?
* Did you verify that the default coloring is left as it was for both light, dark and high contrast theme?

"Question: What should happen if the assembly contains `=`? `=` isn't a restricted character; an assembly named `foo=bar=baz.dll` is perfectly kosher.

What *will* happen is that things will *break* two lines down, because the assumption is that there is only one `=` on a line. If there are more than one, the first item is the assembly, the second is the value, but we'd *actually* have a line containing:

    foo=bar=baz=1

but then do `assemblyIdentityMap.Add(""foo"", ""bar"")`, which is wrong.

What we can *instead* do is reorder the values: instead of `ASSEMBLY=DIRECTORY`, do `DIRECTOR=ASSEMBLY`, then use the `string.Split(char[], int)` overload.

For example, if we instead had a line of:

    1=foo=bar=baz.dll

Then `line.Split(new[]{'='}, 2)` will return `new[]{ ""1"", ""foo=bar=baz.dll"" }`, which is fine.

This implies that the file format needs ""reversing""."

I don't think those are likely to be a problem though.

`IInputEvent::Create` is also called in a couple of places in `InputStateMachineEngine`, but those are exclusively for keyboard and mouse events as far as I can see.

I think the rest are all in tests, which I didn't bother looking at, but I see now they've resulted in some test failures. Hopefully those are just tests that need to be updated, though, and not an indication that there's something fundamentally wrong with this approach."
"> I am not convinced that is a parser error. With several languages, backslashes
> need to be escaped _by the user_, not by the parser. For example JavaScript:

I'm sure it was not intended to be an error. Indeed it is still a possibility to preserve a quotation mark in an argument. But we already have an alternative by doubling them. And doubling the backslash is the way out with the current parser. But think about an argument like `""C:\program files\\""`.
Doesn't it feel wrong if the user has to double the last backslash only? And it's not the CMD shell which requires the double backslash...
@github is IMO absolutely right. It's easy to prove  that the app receives the `""C:\""` from my example above. Just print the command line that `GetCommandLineW()` returns. Various shells may require additional escaping in order to pass a final `""C:\""` to the recipient after internal parsing. But that's not ours. We have to ensure that the received arguments are parsed in a comprehensible way  that meets the user's expectations."

"> This sounds wrong to me. If the long term plan is to allow the choice of ""none"", ""bright"", ""bold"", and ""all"", then the pre-1.10 behavior is ""bright"" rather than ""none"".

Sorry yea, that is a little confusing. Right now, there's only two values that the settings will actually accept - `bold` and `none`. `none` will still do the bright thing that we've always done right now, until we come through and actually add support for the `bright` setting. Then `none` will be (not bright, not bold). 

I'm not sure I can fiddle with the enum parsing enough in this PR to make it so the only options are some set of `bold`, `bright`, and `all`. Maybe this PR doesn't make any sense at all without also doing the bright setting (though that's harder 😕)"

What's the reason for this? Is it for IDEs trying to support link in JavaScript projects ? Is it really important to hack the parser like this so one or two IDEs have an easy way of locating the parent tag description and position to insert a link  ?  They can still implement that (although it's harder/hacky/slow for them) without this hack in the compiler... 

In which kind of projects are they trying to support @github ? Which reference syntax are these projects using , the usejsdocs.org one or TypeScript one?  

In the later case, these projects are already breaking usejsdocs ""standard"" so they should not be using @github or {@github} but something else

In the first case, then I assume the motive for this hack is to support IDEs  so they can *easily/fast* recreate the broken parent tag description and find the position to insert the anchor. If that's the case don't you think **they** should be responsible of solving their own problems? And if, as best case, they are just trying to solve the problem of jsdoc referencing once and for all, do you think this is the correct way of doing it?

If this is more or less right, then I'm worried that you didn't consider nor the compiler API user (for which BTW you introduced a breaking change), nor in the jsdoc writer for which TypeScript could provide typechecked references supporting refactors easily, and nor on typeScript developers since althoguh this change affected compiler performance minimally it shows performance place in this project priorities

I made an informal quick proposal  https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/16498#issuecomment-508316922 and I would love to document in more detail discuss and implement it, but I would like first to know if such feature would be accepted ? 

I think TypeScript now has the opportunity to define the definitely and single way of document JavaScript APIs as other languages have, and a feature like this would help a lot in that direction.

">  the instruction counts will be wrong in dumps which will be confusing

They are wrong currently because of `align` instructions as well. Although it will be good to fix it at one point, but I didn't notice it until I tried it today to double check. So, I wouldn't do this to just make dumps consistent. You can always output data in disasm to showcase what is going on. E.g. in below assembly code, we insert `align` instruction but then decided not to do the alignment. The ""instruction count"" doesn't take it out, but visually, you can see the `align` didn't happen because of `[0 bytes for IG03]` text.

> is there particular reason for concern about doing it this way other than it being new?

The reason I am reluctant is because the notion of updating the `insCount` is new and I am not sure if all the code of all targets (when we support armarch) is resilient to this. Nor we are not sure if we have enough test coverage to all possible affected paths. Errors can come not just from asserts but also silent bad code gen which takes time to debug and investigate."

"As a new-comer to this code, it feels wrong to provide incorrect key sizes and results for ""IsValidKeySize"". When we are executing on Browser, I guess I thought it was better to straight-up be honest about which key sizes are valid. If someone had code that inspected these properties/methods and returned a nice error to the user supplying the wrong key size, but now gets ""PlatformNotSupportedException"" doesn't seem like a great experience.

If I'm not missing anything there will be no user callback querying `LocalEndpoint` in case of failure, however we may end up adding internal code doing so in the future, for example in a tracing call like this:

Such a call may enforce caching a wrong value for `LocalEndpoint` permanently, on the other hand it's probably very unlikely we do such a thing by accident. I wonder if it makes sense to add tests to ensure such failing async methods will not alter the sockets internal state in an unwanted way.

Honestly white spaces seems to be causing a lot of issues with the test that was preexisting, I am wondering if I really should just have the code just strip whitespace characters on the formatting as well. There might also be some places from my code that also gets subject to that just with something like this I think:

The problematic code path is specific to unloadability and the comment that was there indicated that there is no need for added reference, yet it was adding one via the not obvious handling of references in the CollectibleAssemblyHolder.

"> I'm on the fence about ValueTask. On one hand, RequestDelegate doesn't return a ValueTask and we're not returning an async value so we can just use Task.CompletedTask were appropriate.

Of course, that's only worthwhile if whoever is awaiting the action doesn't immediately convert the ValueTask to a Task like the middleware pipeline would.

I think it should be `Task` since all of our existing APIs today are Task based. No point introducing friction here.

"> I understand that approxparents is being passed correctly, but why isn't it preventing the exact type load?

This is a type that has never been loaded before, and approxparents doesn't help in this case of server GC (and AFAIK, not even with regular GC). The issue with server GC is that it doesn't have a valid `Thread` object associated with its thread, and the TypeLoader uses that `Thread` object in its locking logic. Without one, we AV right now. Even without server GC, in a checked build, we will hit this debug only code here: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/coreclr/src/vm/siginfo.cpp#L1104, which uses the `DontLoadTypes` flag, and we'll hit the assert right after this call because we'll get back a null TypeHandle.

My understanding is that approxparents won't help if the type has not been previously loaded to at least approxparents, because we should never be allowed to create types (not even to the level of approxparents) during GC. Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.

One possible easy way to fix this is to handle the null `Thread*` case, to avoid the AV, but I believe this would be a hack to mask one of the symptoms, and the bottom line is, we should still never load any type during GC. So I don't think this would be a correct fix.

I currently see 2 patterns here where we could be calling into a MethodDesc's entry point without potentially loading the valuetypes in the signature:

1. Entry points returned from dictionary lookups that we directly call into (Ex: delegates. I haven't verified that the bug exists in this scenario though).
2. Entry points returned by the `JIT_VirtualFunctionPointer` helper (the case of this bug here)

In these two cases, when jitting the callers of such methods, the JIT is dealing with the canonical version of things, so all the places where the JIT/JIT interface calls into the `classMustBeLoadedBeforeCodeIsRun` won't help.

The possible fix I see here is to call the `MethodDesc::WalkValueTypeParameters()` on these MethodDescs for which we return an entry point out of the two lookups I mentioned above, and load valuetypes in the signature to at least approxparents level.

If this doesn't feel like the right thing to do, this means that when we load these MethodDescs on the TypeLoader side, we should perform this step of walking the parameters and loading them, but this could be an overkill, and I think it might be better to perform that kind of loading only when we're about to execute the methods.

@github, @github  I'd like to get your thoughts on this proposed fix. If you'd like, I can post an updated PR with what I'm proposing for clarification."

This is probably related to this issue here. I currently cannot say, whether this is a direct result of a wrong declaration of the `System.Data.OleDb.tagDBPARAMS` structure itself, or just a result of some other incorrect structure or behavior in OleDb, that will crash the app much later, but I would assume, it is the latter.

This mostly happens after at least 300 calls, but can happen after 700 calls or even never in our test runs.

Also note, that this behavior happens on an x64 test run, so there seem to be some issues with those as well and it might not be automatically the case, that the x64 structure definitions (or their marshaling) are correct.

"I have been thinking a bit more about this `TypeFlags.Intersection` check, and I think it is too permissive because the intersection could have unions as constituents. Here is an example:

    x: string;
}
interface A2 {

interface B1 {

}
interface B2 {
    b: any;
    x2: string;
}

var t: Target;
var s: (A1 | A2) & (B1 | B2);
t = s;
```

This assignment is supposed to fail, because no matter which side of the intersection you're looking it, there could be a union constituent where x has the wrong type (string instead of number). But because you are recursively diving into the properties of the unions as well as the intersections, you end up losing information about the property x. As a result, we allow the assignment, even though it is bad.

"> I'm not so sure about that. I think there are legit scenarios which will never care about trimming, mostly complex apps with a shared framework like VS. Why should we limit everyone to a common ground if the needs are different for large and small apps?

I don't see the problem here to be honest. If a given app doesn't care about trimming that's fine. Some features will be ""broken"" when trimming (startup hooks as an example), those features will produce warnings. But if I can build my app without warnings its behavior should be consistent across all of the builds where I don't get warnings. I think @github take on this is the right one - the behavior will not be identical, different build configurations are intentionally modifying some behavior of the app (debug enables better debugging experience, self-contained changes deployment requirements, ...). But features which are not intentionally affected by the change of configuration should NOT be affected. Crazy example: building the app as Debug should not run it with a different default culture when compared to Release.

It's kind of hard to make a broad statement, since there will always be exceptions and gotchas, but I would much like to make a relatively simple statement about the consistency of behavior across different build/publish configurations. To me it's about expectations - clicking a single check-box in VS to enable single-file doesn't ""feel"" dangerous, so it should not break my app (or if it will, it should tell me -> warnings).

> Self-contained versus framework-dependent

I think that some verticals will not support framework-dependent and that's OK, but those which will should behave consistently across the two configurations. To that end the verticals which don't support framework-dependent should warn if I try to force it - building Blazor client WASM app should fail/warn if I explicitly state --self-contained false. (It actually does fail today, but for different reasons, which is not ideal)."

"Right, the FCall existed already but it was only ever being used to set the target to `null`. I'm definitely not a GC internals expert so I might be wrong, but from what I can see it would appear that the target of a dependent handle is stored in a `GCHANDLE` in the VM, which does seem to support updating the referenced object? As in, if `DependentHandle` is storing the target through a normal GC handle (although with the mode set to dependent), shouldn't the same functionality from `GCHandle.Target` apply here as well? Either way I'd love to learn more about this 😄

I guess we can ask @github to confirm this and then decide how to proceed with the API?
I'm thinking if this is actually supported then we might just need to decide how to prevent users from setting the target to `null` and then back to a valid object, or alternatively if it isn't we could just make `Target` a readonly property to fix the issue? 🤔"

## Customer Impact

Fixes a bug reported by customer via email, where an async read operation performed on a `FileStream` opened for **non-seekable device** file was throwing an `System.IO.IOException`: ""The parameter is incorrect"".

It turns out that `ReadFile` [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile#parameters) was wrong:

> For an hFile that does not support byte offsets, Offset and OffsetHigh are ignored.

And `OVERLAPPED` [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped#members) was right:

> This member is nonzero only when performing I/O requests on a seeking device that supports the concept of an offset (also referred to as a file pointer mechanism), such as a file. Otherwise, this member **must be zero**.


## Testing

We already had a test for that, but it's part of Outerloop and that is why the regression was missed:

```log
      System.IO.Tests.DeviceInterfaceTests.DeviceInterfaceCanBeOpenedForAsyncIO [FAIL]
        System.IO.IOException : The parameter is incorrect. : '\\?\hid#vid_0b0e&pid_24c8&mi_03&col02#b&92ae56&0&0001#{4d1e55b2-f16f-11cf-88cb-001111000030}'
        Stack Trace:
          D:\projects\runtime\src\libraries\System.IO.FileSystem\tests\FileStream\FileStreamConformanceTests.Windows.cs(209,0): at System.IO.Tests.DeviceInterfaceTests.DeviceInterfaceCanBeOpenedForAsyncIO()
          --- End of stack trace from previous location ---
    Finished:    System.IO.FileSystem.Tests
```

The test was used to ensure that it's passing now.

## Risk

Very low.

"Everyone, thank you for the discussion, but this is not the place for it.  This PR is simply using a now-existing C# feature, it is not designing nor implementing that feature in the language or compiler (if the feedback were on how the feature was employed in dotnet/runtime, that would be appropriate here, but that's not what this discussion has become).  The C# language design team doesn't regularly pay attention to this repo, nor to specific PRs in this repo, and this is not where the community-at-large expects to find and discuss language features.  Feedback on a language feature on a PR in this repo will largely go unseen by the relevant folks.  If you would like to provide feedback on C# language design, the right place is https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang.  If you feel strongly that `!!` is the wrong design and/or could be improved, as I requested earlier please open an issue in https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues to discuss it there, where language discussions are had and language decisions are made.

If it had a NULL password or an empty password it will load using the simple ctor.  If it's a PFX with a password other than those two values, then it'd throw an exception for the password being wrong.

> I want to avoid forcing people to convert their certificate format to do this

In my experience (and certainly in the Linux+Let's Encrypt+certbot case) a PEM key is paired with a PEM cert; particularly because they'll use openssl commands, which use PEM output unless you tell it otherwise.

> this is something that I've seen used in other web frameworks too. (DER Cert + PEM key)

Can you give some examples?

> Will this be a problem as long as we check that the certificate loaded in advance doesn't have an associated private key or are there any other issues we should be aware of.

The X509Certificate2 constructor, much to my chagrin, doesn't do simple things.  It does complex things.  The input data can be:

* X.509 public key certificate, binary encoded
* X.509 public key certificate, PEM encoded
* (Not Linux today, bug should be fixed later in 5) A PKCS#7 SignedCms object, binary encoded, where the first signer cert is used
* (Not Linux today, bug should be fixed later in 5) A PKCS#7 SignedCms object, PEM encoded, where the first signer cert is used
* (Windows-only) An authenticode-signed exe, dll, msi, msu, etc, where the first signer cert is used.
* (Windows-only) The SerializedCert format (Windows-proprietary) and probably other things.
* A PKCS#12 PFX, binary encoded

If you really wanted to support both the binary and PEM encoding of a certificate, but restrict the inputs to more sensible things, you could use X509Certificate2.GetCertContentType to ask what it is, and only accept X509.  That still eliminates the case where you load a PFX and have a keyfile specified (and avoids writing the key to disk at all in that error case)."
"Is it possible we need a more explicit signal that the Blazor Server client-side code is wired up and ready to go?

Reacting to the WebSockets traffic is an indicator that things have started happening, but I'm not sure it guarantees that `blazor.server.js` has got as far as activating the link click interception. There might still be some time gap where it can go wrong.

We are a bit limited in what we can do when testing the templates, as we can't add any test-specific logic to the application being tested. If we're keen to solve this, one option would be something like getting PlayWright to wait until the DOM contains some artifacts that are specific to interactive rendering, such as the comment marker tags we put around component outputs, or even explicitly looking for the delegating event handler registered on the root element.

If you think this is sufficiently unlikely to make a difference then I'm fine with leaving it until we see reliability issues. Might be good to clarify the comment in the test sources though to at least state what kind of test reliability issue this logic is meant to mitigate."
"@github 
I discussed how to structure the options with DavidP.
We're thinking it may be better to stick with boolean options (rather than enum options), but have more than one (one for literals, one for lambdas, one for everything) when we want, under one section.
Then it would look like the section for ""var"" preferences:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12466233/30287461-0481c7e4-96da-11e7-8132-706435dfd50c.png)

In the meantime, it would be a single boolean option for literals.

This would also solve a technical problem. When I tried to fix the code above (since `BooleanCodeStyleOptionViewModel` because I pass an option that's wrong), the constructor for `EnumCodeStyleOptionViewModel` does not seem to handle per-language options, but only plain options.

Let me know if that approach seems ok."
"Or maybe we just ask CTI to add a scenario where they have 6.0 and 7.0 installed, and run dotnet new, I believe that would catch it right since it would install the wrong version?

However, I don't really recommend that as it has a lot of magic that can go wrong that is hard to debug specifically when you start mixing COM and WinRT, InProc and OutOfProc, and STA and MTA.

However, you **could** potentially use `Microsoft::WRL::SimpleClassFactory<T>()` here instead of implementing it  yourself as `MonarchFactory` by doing

Ignore this! I'm wrong haha
"This causes us to *completely ignore* the `androidSdk.JavaSdkPath` value, meaning `$(JavaSdkDirectory)` is now entirely ignored.

This seems...wrong? :-)

Instead, I *think* we want (-ish):

```csharp
var jdks = new[]{new JdkInfo (androidSdk.JavaSdkPath)}.Concat (Tools.JdkInfo.GetKnownSystemJdkInfos (logger));
var jdk = jdks.Where (j => j.MaxVersion != null ? j.Version <= maxVersion : true)
    .Where (j => j.IncludePath.Any ())
    .FirstOrDefault ();
if (jdk == null)
    Log.LogError (…);
// use jdk...
```

Error checking excluded.  If `$(JavaSdkDirectory)` is set and is valid -- i.e. `AndroidSdkInfo` was constructed -- then we should use `new JdkInfo ($(JavaSdkDirectory))` aka `new JdkInfo (androidSdk.JavaSdkPath)`, and use that *preferentially*.

Question about this preferential use: if e.g. JDK 9 is specified, *should we use it*?  That might be helpful for testing new JDK versions.

If `$(JavaSdkDirectory)` *isn't* set/`AndroidSdkInfo` doesn't construct, *then* we should consult `JdkInfo.GetKnownSystemJdkInfos()`."
Nope. We fixed this with #5934 :smile: we got some of the widths wrong
"I think maybe we are conflating two issues:

1. There are bugs in `ApiCompat` that have led to wrong (DIM members) or unclear (changing return types) error messages.
2. `ApiCompat` is not an API differ, it only reports API breakages.

This PR seems to implement `#2` (an API differ) as a temporary fix for `#1`, which is probably fine, but we should consider what our long-term goal is here.

Once `ApiCompat` is fixed, it will no longer show `InterfacesShouldHaveSameMembers`, but this doesn't really help us understand what **is** changing.  We could accidentally be adding tons of new public members that we didn't intend.

Long-term, I think what we want is: a report generated that shows **any** changes to our public API (`#2`).  And the process that generates this report raises an error if any of those changes are **breaking**.

Somehow we want to enforce not only that we don't introduce **breaking** changes, but that any change to our public API is intentional.

"Ok, I was wrong about this.  The problem is that System.Numerics.Vectors is not yet yet built in source-build at the point when Roslyn is built because we need Roslyn to build runtime.  Our usual fix for this is to let the repo use a ref-only version of the package to break the cycle.  This ref-only version contains no `lib` directory, so this copy fails.  To my knowledge we haven't seen any issues in source-built SDKs caused by this, but I would be happy to use another fix if possible.

we can apply the refactoring and extract `(infer R extends string ? string : never)` to obtain this:

"@github I would be fine with that!

One thing to make sure of though is, with regards to incremental parsing:

if you use the same `SyntaxKind` in multiple places, you are effectively stating that any node with that kind is interchangeable in that place.  i.e.   by stating that you take a VariableDeclaration `SyntaxKind` there, you are stating that any node with `SyntaxKind.VariableDeclaration` could then go there.  Is that actually the case?

i.e. can you see all these variable patterns in a binding:

```
a) simple name:                        a
b) name with type:                     a: number
c) name with initializer:              a = expr
d) name with type and initializer:     a: number = expr
```

?

If these are all things that can show up in a binding element list, then reusing `SyntaxKind.VariableDeclaration` is definitely a safe and appropriate thing to do. 

However, If any of them cannot show up in a binding element list, then using this `SyntaxKind` here would be problematic.  The issue is that we could have a normal variable declaration from the old tree, see that that's what you want in the parser currently, and then reuse the node in the binding element list.  We'd do that, even though it's not valid in the new context because it's not what the parser would actually produce for that code any more.

From looking at parseBindingElement, i think this is not safe (but i could be reading things wrong!).  For example, i don't think you support forms 'b' or 'd' in a binding element list.  As such, i would lean on having a new BindingElement `SyntaxKind` that would accurately demarcate these nodes, and prevent them from being used in places where we actually want a real VariableDeclaration (and vice-versa).

In terms of their structural shape, they would of course be the same.  But in terms of their `SyntaxKind`, they would clearly indicate that they represented non-interchangeable pieces of code.

"not sure that I got this right: here we'll alias `recursiveDirWatchers` as `watchers` and then at the line 365 we'll put fresh watcher in `watchers` so it will end up in `recursiveDirWatchers` however on the next line we'll return `{ watcher, isRecursive: false}`. Since we are using value of  `isRecursive` to pick the map to delete the element it seems we'll use wrong set.

"This by itself didn't fix the issue for me. 
Because I'm desperate and have been struggling with this for a while, this (in addition to fixes in this PR) solved it for me:

in the bottom of `function cloneSourceFileWithChanges(`
```javascript
            node.pragmas = source.pragmas || new Map();
            node.text = source.text || """";
            return node;
```
But maybe parts of it can be solved in:
`var node = baseFactory.createBaseSourceFileNode(303 /* SourceFile */);` ?

---

Edit: After further testing, I only needed the above change to `cloneSourceFileWithChanges` to solve my issue, not the change in the PR.

---

Edit2: I had 2 projects in an microfrontends environment, one was a library with some files that had a file in `<projectRoot>/model/<filename>.ts` and `<projectRoot>/<filename>/package.json` that referenced it. 
When importing from the 2nd project, if imprting like vscode suggested `<projectRoot>/model/<filename>`, I get this error. 
When importing the `package.json` path instead it works: `import <filename> from ""<projectRoot>/<filename>"";`
Basically, a horrible debug experience where I had to dig through github issues, the typescript compiler and various other things because I imported something the wrong way. 
But adding the above mentioned lines to the clone method solved the issue symptoms for me, but in fact I should fix the import... 

---

Edit3: I experienced issues with this 4 months later. 
I added 
```javascript
            if (node.pragmas === undefined) {
                console.log(""Error when importing: "" + node.fileName)
                console.log(node)
                console.log(""Should import the package.json, not the ts-file!"")
            }
```
to `cloneSourceFileWithChanges` in my `typescript.js` file to at least give some kind of non-worthless message."

"This is wrong. The `std::stoul` is for ""unsigned long"", but we are returning an `int`.

"`findAntecedent` (vs operating on all antecedents in some way) seems _slightly_ wrong. There are cases, I think, where a node could have multiple `Present` flagged antecedents, like at the start of a `finally` block, eg

try {

        // ...
    }
    if (a.b?.c) {
        // ...
    }
}
finally {
    if (a?.b?.c) {} // every flow node in the `try` is an antecedent of the start of the `finally`.
}
```

"After changing it turns out we have some failing tests. When parts[0] is empty and it can happen when we are testing with `expression = "".a.""` then we end with parts = { """", ""a"", """" }. So indexing 0th element is not safe. When we use FirstOrDefault we are sure not to index wrong. The expressions cannot be too long as they are manually provided by users so iterating through one part to get the last element does not seem painful here because we would have to check for nullOrEmpty in the indexing scenario additionally.

<hr />

Logically after an update is applied, tokens refer to rows in tables that are a concatenation of all the added rows from every update.  (ie: if the baseline table 0x23 had 2 rows and then generation 1 an added 3 more rows, an index like 0x05
refers to table 0x23 row 3 from gen 1).

The way the lookup works is that the EnC map table records the logical tokens of the update.  So for table 0x23 the 3 additions in gen 1 will have entries like encmap row 5 = 0x23000003, row 6 = 0x23000004, row 7 = 0x23000005, and then rows for the next table and so on.  The relative index in gen1 of token 0x23000005 then, is the distance of its row (ie row 7) from the first token for the table (ie row 5), plus 1 (since tokens are 1-based).  So in this case token 0x23000005 corresponds to the 7-5+1 = 3rd row of table 0x23 in the gen1 dmeta image.

The problem is that previously we returns this index-base+1 computation even in cases where we walked either to the end of the encmap table or past the last row for the table we care about.

In the case where we walked to the end of the encmap table, the index-base+1 could sometimes return a value that looked like a valid token.  The upshot is that we looked up an incorrect AssemblyRef (0x23 table) from the wrong generation.

The updated code returns -1 for all cases where we didn't find an encmap row for our given token.

"> One case we lose loops, for Int32ToHexChars...

For cases like these with OR exit conditions, we'd need multiple blocks to be handled during inversions. Basically look at all the backedges into the loop top block, and if any of those come from blocks ""below"" that first exit... they also need to be duplicated.

You can't handle the subsequent blocks quite the same way as the first one. That is, copying the block code into the block before the loop is wrong, you now need a new block.

As discussed offline, according to the current merged wrapper
architecture, for architecture-variant tests all versions
are compiled and the ""wrong"" variants get skipped at runtime
using the ConditionalFact attribute. Sadly for some of the ILPROJ
tests JITting the ""wrong"" variant ends up crashing the JIT during
Crossgen2 compilation. We can follow up by figuring out whether
the crash is intentional but for now a simple way to work around
this problem (hitting just a small number of tests) is to mark
them as out-of-process tests so that the wrong variants get
filtered out early and R2R compilation is not triggered for them.

Thanks

Tomas

"> If anything, BlockingCollection has been superseded by more modern patterns such as [System.Threading.Channels](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/an-introduction-to-system-threading-channels/) so we should encourage users to adopt that instead.

@github my understanding is that the [Channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.channels) are intended for asynchronous scenarios. Using them is synchronous scenarios will require blocking on asynchronous methods that return `ValueTask`s, that require converting these to `Task`s with [`AsTask`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.valuetask.astask), that will result in an allocation on each blocking operation. Which is something undesirable in general. So, unless my understanding is wrong, the `BlockingCollection<T>` has still a place in modern concurrent programming."

Fixes: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/69010

We map the entire file and then adjust the pointer to get to the bundle. When we need to unmap, having the bundle, we reverse the adjustment to get the address of the mapping.
The math for reversing the adjustment was incorrect. The adjustment due to embedding in larger container (such as universal binary) was applied with a wrong sign. For large binaries we could offset the pointer beyond the mapping and unmap something random - if there is nothing mapped there, no harm, if something is mapped (like our own binary) we could cause crashes.

"I think `Activity` lifecycle events and `Application` lifecycle events are 2 different things. They may sometimes (mostly incase of single Activity) fire together but they're not always synonymous.

If an `Activity` corresponds to `Window` then it is not correct to assume it's lifecycle events applies to the whole application. This is wrong in 2 cases, multiple `Window`s/`Activity`s and background services.

I guess the current implementation in MAUI uses the `Activity`'s event because there are no corresponding events on the `Application` class (except for OnCreate). The `Xamarin.AndroidX.Lifecycle.Process` package provides those events and I think it will be a more accurate implementation.

"> Otherwise, we might be able to do it in our `ResolveNativeProjectReference` target. (Though I'm not sure if the fast up to date check runs targets to collect `UpToDateCheckInput`, or if they have to be static).

I though they had to be evaluation time constant but that might be wrong: https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/blob/c954a632f74afdac9118a1f505257107789ff00e/docs/up-to-date-check.md#customization talks about a target.

"But I really feel like this code has to be somewhere in the speculation analyzer and not scattered around individual features. Doing this fixes bugs in other features too. One example I found is:

        break;
}
```
do inline temporary on 'b' - it will use replace 'b' with 'default' and produce the error.
But with this change, it will introduce a cast and the resulting code will be correct:
```c#
switch (true)
{
    case ((bool)(default)):
        break;

that seems wrong. @github is this expected?
"> I am not sure what you mean - assert failure here means operation.FormatString != null && operation.FormatString.Kind != OperationKind.Literal. What additional information does your approach give over this one?

The ```Assert.True``` when fails simply says the value is false when it was expected to be true. The ```Assert.Equal``` tells you what was the actual value when it is not matching the expectation, therefore providing valuable information, which often allows to understand what went wrong without debugging the test. It is fine if you don't want to make this change, I'll do it myself after the PR is merged.

"> So isn't this a problem with entire handling of model binding of `""null""` json on nullable parameter with `TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue==true`?

I do not think that the condition is wrong just because we did some improvements (.NET 7) in how we are treating the AllowEmptyBody based on the Nullabity in I feel only very specific scenarios will allow `empty body` and not `null` or vice versa.

> @github Bruno Lins de Oliveira FTE Is there anything wrong with just removing the `if (model == null && !context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue)` branch entirely `SystemTextJsonInputFormatter` and always `return InputFormatterResult.Success(model);` when `JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync()` doesn't throw?

@github  As we discussed, ""null"" and empty body are different, however, MVC treat them as the same for STJ for a long time and change might cause some breaking change. We changed to make the empty body better and most of the cases when a ""null"" is accepted will be covered by this new mechanism, as example:

```c#
public ActionResult([FromBody] Contact? contact) {}
```
or
``` c#
public ActionResult([FromBody] Contact contact = null) {}
```

Until .NET 6 they used to be blocked for both (null and empty body) because we were not using the optionality to allow them. Now, .NET 7, both actions will be accepted (null and empty body).

Since the mechanism will behave differently, as I mentioned, not change it right now might be the best and going back to the original idea of just update the error message to differentiate between `Empty Body` and `null` is a less breaking change.

> Since the comment made it clear there are some inputs being regarded as null I wanted to make sure the json is null literal (which I am not entirely sure how to do since request stream is of course non seekable).

I think the comment about `whitespace` is not true, as you mentioned, and the only situation where we will get a `null` value from the System.Text.Json will be when we have a literal `null`, so i feel we can safe say (only for System.Text.Json) this:

``` csharp
if (model == null && !context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue)
{
            context.ModelState.TryAddModelError(context.ModelName, ""null value not supported"");
            return InputFormatterResult.Failure();
}
```

That will produce a better error message, without change the current behavior. And the new mechanism or the user option to allow empty body will be used to decide if the failure will happen or we will treat as `Success` binding.

Also, I think we should keep the `NewtonsoftJsonInputFormatter` as-is for now.

@github anything to add based on our discussion?
@github is that make sense for you?

> The right-hand side of an 'in' expression must not be a primitive.

Regarding my suggestion for `getApparentType`: I forgot it maps primitives to their corresponding object type (e.g. `number` to `Number`), so that won’t work across the board.

I’ve been playing with this for most of the morning, and there are a lot of missing pieces with unions and intersections that get pretty confusing to think about, especially when comparing with the existing behavior. Eventually, I settled on the principle that we should only suppress this error when there exists some safe instantiation of the RHS type, but it is impossible to narrow the expression down to that type. The goal is that if the user writes the appropriate type guards, they should not get an error for using an in-expression inside those guards, even though the compiler doesn’t narrow through them. Here are the additional tests I came up with:

```ts
function union1<T extends string | number, U extends boolean>(thing: T | U) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Error (because all possible instantiations are errors)
}

function union2<T extends object, U extends string | number>(thing: T | U) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Error (because narrowing is possible)
  if (typeof thing === ""object"") {
    ""key"" in thing; // Ok
  }
}

function union3<T>(thing: T | string | number) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Error (because narrowing is possible)
  if (typeof thing !== ""string"" && typeof thing !== ""number"") {
    ""key"" in thing; // Ok, because further narrowing is impossible
  }
}

function union4<T extends object | ""hello"">(thing: T) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Ok (because narrowing is impossible)
}

function intersection1<T extends number, U extends 0 | 1 | 2>(thing: T & U) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Error (because all possible instantiations are errors)
}

function intersection2<T>(thing: T & (0 | 1 | 2)) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Error (because all possible instantations are errors)

Currently, both in master and in your PR, only `union1` and `union2` exhibit the “wrong” behavior, but it shifted a bit in my quick experiments, so having the rest of those tests will be useful.

One hint is that you probably want to use `getConstraintOfType` instead of the `immediateBaseConstraint` property, for several reasons, one of which is that it works on unions and intersections. My only concern with that though is that it may not be suitable to differentiate between what we have in `union3` and `union4`. You may need to have different logic based on whether `rightType` is “a type variable whose constraint is a union” vs. “a union that includes type variables with some relevant constraint”.

"Current status:

* Both failed tasks are due to build infrastructure failures and aren't even in the Windows builds at all.

* Possible dispute as to whether the code should change to match the documentation or the documentation should match the code but I think it's noise because who ever overrides gethostname†? I can't call GetHostNameW anyway because the win7-x64 and win7-x86 rids still have runtimepacks so there's simply no fixing it that way at this time.

* I only care about Dns.GetHostName() if it does which it is documented to do, that is return the DNS host name on Windows.

† Here's where I think the native documentation is wrong. It says in the absence of a namespace provider it returns the netbios name; however this implies the default return value on out-of-the-box Windows is the netbios name, which it is not."

This PR introduces a simple single-threaded implementation of ```TaskReplicator``` and then makes sure that ```Parallel.Invoke``` and ```.For``` use it . This works around various issues like #44605, #43411.

I still need to verify whether the other Parallel primitives need changes to properly use this in all scenarios, but it works good for the two methods I targeted right now.

I was unable to get platform conditionals to work in any fashion (ifdef, etc) so it's hardcoded to on in this PR right now, which is obviously wrong. If some reviewer can figure out how the heck to make this work I'd appreciate it (see the FIXME in Parallel.cs)

"Eek this is really worrisome for me, since a new snapshot that hasn't re-ran generators yet here might return null or not, and that's depending on timing of other processes.

Do you recall what necessitated this fix? My gut is telling me the caller needs to be moved off this method and should be calling GetDocumentIdInCurrentContext or GetDocumentInCurrentContextWithChanges() instead. Looking at the existing callers to GetOpenDocumentInCurrentContext I see most of them either being movable to GetDocumentIdInCurrentContext or being wrong and should have called WithChanges() so looks like this might have been an icky spot in the first place and if you were trying to look to other code to figure out what to do...that code was wrong too."

"@github/roslyn-ide: some background on this: when @github started doing the source generator work, he did a quick hack to get source generators to run after we produced a compilation in the compilation tracker. Since this was happening _after_ the core workspace processed stuff, this had various problems: TryGetCompilation and GetCompilationAsync would have returned different things, P2P references probably would have been broken, etc. This tries to move the core running into the compilation tracker so there aren't so many things broken with it.

This is still a prototype although one that compiler is interested in dogfooding. The primary goals are:

1. The compilation tracker should behave the same as usual if you aren't on the preview langver, since this all gets short-circuited there.
2. Starting to test out the APIs so we can get some initial experimentation with them.

Out of scope of this PR is:

1. Fleshing out the prototype (you'll see a number of places where the compiler hasn't implemented something, and so we have to punt work because of that.)
2. Trying to use the compiler's incremental update API -- that'll take more work. We've also identified a few API gaps too that need to be addressed before we can do that, we think.
3. Any sort of remotely smart performance handling.
4. Any representation of these in a smart way in the Workspaces layer.

Once this is in to unblock compiler dogfooding, then we'll tackle those. This is emphatically a ""look, we're walking now"" PR where the goal is just to make things be Not Entirely Wrong(tm).

@github and I have been going back and forth on this so we now have some additional feedback on his APIs. Expect those PROTOTYPE comments to go away."
"> It would indeed be exceptional if the compiler passed us tokens of an unexpected syntax.

I don't understand what that means.  I can't find any direct information specifying what is/isn't expected syntax.  I've reverse engineered to the best of my ability.  However, none of this is contracted.  It's all just based on the current impl.  

That's why i write to what i think is going on, but am resilient to me getting things wrong.  

> Yes, it would be a bug in the IDE code that we are not handling some kind of new token syntax or a bug in the compiler that they are producing some kind of bad tokens. In both cases it's our code!

The compiler layer is not our code.  It's the compiler layer.  We should not be crashing in our code if the compiler changes to do something which is legal which we didn't expect.  

The compiler has not promised any invariants here.  IDE should not assume and shoudl not expect a particualr form if it isn't promised.

And yes, it's a bug in our code if we don't handle something from the compiler.  Hence why i assert.  So we can collect the information and decide what to do.  I do not throw an exception though as that's not an *exceptional* occurrence.  

> OK, now I'm confused. Isn't that what I'm saying?

No.  Because tehre are no invariants promised by teh compiler here.  So we shouldn't crash.  If you can get teh compiler to doc explicitly how this works on their end with their tokens, i'm happy to take away the zealous checking, and i'm fine with then crashing if something goes awry.  In *that* case we would be able to track this down to either:

1. the compiler has a bug and is not fitting their documented invariants.  i.e. a compiler bug, which should go to them.
2. the ide didn't understand the invariant of the compiler properly and wrote innapropraite code.  i.e. an IDE bug which would go to them.

Right now we have the compiler producing undocumented data (i.e without invariant) which we are processing.  In the case of undocumented data, we can attempt to work properly on expected patterns, but it woudl be irresponsible to throw or crash on patterns we didn't expect.  We should instead just report this so we can determine what's going on.  

In other words, it's not *exceptional* for the compiler to produce data within their specified contract.  They are allowed to produce what they want, and we need to be resilient to it all.

"So, FWIW, i was saying that roslyn likely almost never needs to use ImmutableDict, and could instead just use a non-mutating view over a normal Dictionary.

I may be wrong though.  @github were there particular hostpots where we could benefit from a readonly-dictionary, but also need to clone?"
"> Just so I have a better picture of this, what does the code look like in a single user app that's using blocking waits on thread pool threads parallelism but has enough work to observe problems with limited concurrency?

Many workloads for which tasks were originally introduced, actually.  Consider, for example, parallelized divide and conquer.  A worker partitions its work into multiple pieces, queues identical workers to process N - 1 of those pieces, processes its own, and then waits for those other workers to complete.  Also think about algorithms that require coordination between those pieces, such as various operations used by PLINQ (e.g. OrderBy) that needs to block each of the workers until they reach a common point so that they can exchange data and all continue on, and what would happen if one of the workers was throttled indefinitely.

> OK so a single user application might want to opt out of this

I think that's the wrong direction, at least for the foreseeable future.  **_If_** we decided to go with an approach like the one proposed in this draft, I have trouble seeing it as anything other than opt-in, given all of the previously cited concerns, the potential for introducing deadlocks where they weren't previously, the potential for casting way too wide a net, the potential for negatively impacting the throughput of unrelated workloads, etc.  **_If** such a mitigation was added as opt-in, and if enough testing demonstrated it was a good decision for certain workloads, then it could potentially be automatically opted-in for those, e.g. if you felt ASP.NET should always turn this on.  Even there, though, I'd be surprised if in the current configuration that was a wise choice."

"> The Exception is not bubbled up to host.StartAsync.

"> I guess it means if the profile for callsite's block is wrong  - we're also losing usefull profile of the inlinee?

Yes. Profile data can be ""wrong"" in several different ways.
1.  we might have bugs in our processing that set block counts to zero when they should be nonzero
2. we might be collecting on too narrow of a scenario

Hopefully we find and fix most of the first kind of problem. 

For the second kind we need to be careful not to ""overfit"" to the profile data we have and assume all other behavior is unlikely. The proposal for that is to also run synthesis in tandem, it will give a less extreme view of what is possible at runtime, and then blend the profile data and the synthesized data together. Thus only if both systems agree a block is rare will it end up being rare."
"Thanks for the PR.

I want to make sure I understand what this is trying to fix:
#3525 is about `.deps.json`, but this fix seems to be about `additionalProbingPaths` in `.runtimeconfig.json`. There is some discussion about this in #3525 but it's definitely not the primary purpose of that issue.
So I assume this is trying to fix the fact that `additionalProbingPaths` are relative to current directory and not to the application directory.

As for the change, this could be considered a breaking change, so I don't think it can be done as-is. I can see two possible solutions:
* Add two probing paths if the value is a relative path
  * One where it's resolved against the current directory (current behavior, goes first)
  * One where it's resolved against the application directory (new behavior, goes second)
* Change the behavior only for .NET 6+, in which case the behavior would need to adapt based on the TFM of the app. I think this would be the first time we did something like that in the host, but it might work.

Personally I would probably prefer the second solution - only change this for .NET 6+. I do think that the current behavior is just wrong, so fixing this is great, but we can't break existing apps (Note that this code lives in `hostfxr` which is global, every version of .NET Core on the machine will use the latest `hostfxr`, so we must maintain backward compatibility for this component).

As for the actual code of the change:
* It doesn't compile for me - `GetString` is not a member of `pal::string_t`.
* Resolving relative paths by concatenation is very problematic, at the very least it should use `append_path`
* The code as-is will prepend the directory even to absolute paths, which will break
* The code should use application's directory as the base, not the directory of `.runtimeconfig.json`. While they are typically the same, they don't have to be. I think the correct behavior is for the paths to be relative to the app.
* Additional probing paths can also be specified on the command line. I think the behavior should be the same regardless of which way the probing path was added.
* To accept the change it will need tests to cover the new behavior (and in this case also validate the backward compatibility)"
"The testhost ""wrong"" name is an ordering issue with the properties as the property we depend on was introduced in `Directory.Build.Targets`... @github  any reason why we introduced it in the targets and not the props file here: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/52897/files#diff-469a3c721b6b95e2cf18fbdd38040bcdf163c0fb04a15f511af71882fc2ae74bR23?

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/57310

This change is fixing a regression from .NET 5.0. The problem happens when trying to create a CultureInfo object using culture names that Windows don't allow. 
This regression occurred during the code refactoring work done to optimize the globalization data size and WASM support.
Although this fix is addressing the regression, it fixes another issue I have discovered during the investigation. Here is what the change is doing:
- In the file `CultureData.Windows.cs`, the condition `ShouldUseUserOverrideNlsData` is wrong to use. The reason is this part of the code is not concerned about the user overrides. Even the user overrides flag is not initialized yet at this stage.
- In the same file, I added the call to Windows API `GetLocaleInfoEx` that help validate the culture name. That is what we have done in .NET 5.0 too.
- In the file `IcuLocaleData.cs`, there was a bug that caused not finding the proper culture name mapping to our data because the culture name containing characters like underscore `_`.
- Fixing and adding tests.

What's wrong with the trailing comma? It produces less diff when someone adds new value/removes values
"Going to set this aside for a while to focus on OSR. Looks like:
* there are possibly restrictions with forwarding unmanaged calls (messed up pinvoke transitions)
* something perhaps wrong with native AOT. Tried reproing this but was unable to build the tests properly.
* SPMI diffs may be too large to download? I can run them locally, but they take a long time...

@github feel free to look into any of the above."

This complements #57079 and contributes to #22977

Unlike the server part, this is somewhat more complicated. It may still need some work but I would like to get early feedback for the overall strategy.

Lets start with some numbers:

When `SslStreamCertificateContext`  is used on server side, TLS resume is possible and we get ~ 5.5x boost. 
This should get us on par with Windows but I don't have to same machines to verify this. 
On server side #57079 linked the cache to the `SslStreamCertificateContext`. So when server will reuse it it will also provide ability to resume previous session. When the context is Disposed, it will also dispose the SSL_CTX and the cache. 

This creates first complication for client. It also needs to use same `SSL_CTX` but since there is typically no certificate, there is nothing to hook to. 
To solve this I added separate dictionary to hold contexts for client. That allows to reuse previous context and save native allocations. But the native contexts will be preserved during duration of the process. Complete test runs for `SslStream` creates 13 instance, in ideal case there will be one e.g. `SslProtocols.None`. e.g. it depends on unique combinations of `SslProtocols` used by the client. 

To make it more complicated, OpenSSL pushes responsibility for setting the sessions to caller e.g. `SslStream`. 
So we use the `TargetHost` e.g. SNI host to lookup previous session. Since there may be multiple series running on same name this is not perfect. But since this is just offer to the server, it is up to the server to decide if the session is valid or not. Based on my testing, this is how SCHANNEL operates. Some implementations use IP/Port info for the lookup but SslStream does not have access to it in general case. Even with that, this can be just load balancer and the SSL may be terminated or different servers. Once again, if the session is offered to ""wrong"" server or if the server was restored or cleaned up the session, it should proceed with full handshake. 

The rest is mostly technicality. In order to process the sessions, we need to register callbacks and OpenSSL will inform us when it wants to add or remove session. There is some plumbing to map that to .NET and original `TargetHost`.
There can be multiple sessions for given host but the current strategy is to keep the last one. 

I added some methods to SafeSslContextHandle to allocate cache and do operations.  The `GCHandle` can possibly be stored in native SSL_CTX but I felt  it would be easier for debug to keep it on managed side. Since the sessions are not directly used anywhere in managed code, I use `IntPtr` instead of SafeHandle.

"It's a bit subtle that `TryStartActivityFromUri` has that name (`Try...`) yet returns `void`, and that on this branch of the if/else we always return yet on the other we fall through to the base. I'm not suggesting the logic is wrong, just that a year from now, it might be a challenge for us to reason about why it goes like this. The fallthrough structure heightens the risk that we make a change that intends to affect one case but actually affects other cases too.

Would it be viable to do either one or both of the following?

 * Structure the code so there's no fallthrough from one case to another, i.e., that we're in ""HTTP URL"" or ""other scheme URL"" or ""null URL"" mode, and each of those fully encapsulates its own logic and definitely returns (which might involve returning a call to base.ShouldOverrideUrlLoading)
 * Add code comments briefly stating why the choice of whether or not to call base is correct. Perhaps each of the three top-level branches could have a sentence summarizing the reasoning for that case.

Likewise I'm wondering if we should be calling the `ExternalNavigationStarting` event for non-HTTP(S) destinations. My sense is that developers would likely want to have control over such navigations too."

That said, the expectation is wrong.  There is no guarantee that you will be able to classify any region of text.  It's completely reasonable and possible to ask for classification and get nothing back.  First, the language may not even support classification.  Second, you can def return an empty result back.

It is always good to have test that prevents a regression in the future. Is there an existing test that would fail if the behavior of the function were to change as suggested? What would be the nature of the failure?

* sends a completion event with the duration for a given generator
* sends a completion event with the duration for the generator driver

I'd maybe look at changing this to use the tasks here by doing the following:

* emit a `GeneratorDriverStart`/`GeneratorDriverStop` event pair using the driver task and op codes
* emit a `GeneratorStart`/`GeneratorStop` event pair using the generator task and op codes
* calculate the run time by diffing the timestamps of the events (the infrastructure should already do this by embedding the duration in the `*Stop` events)

What's currently written should be fine, but would subject the times in the events to any issues the timer has with waking up etc. The times are already being provided by the event infrastructure so you can take advantage of that.

> to report this error into MethodCompiler's bag.

MethodCompiler isn't the only caller. Is there a problem if we always report the diagnostic into the bag given to the `SourcePropertySymbolBase` constructor?

---

> Alternatively, if we don't mind reporting this error per field usage, we could report this check in the binder, where ERR_InterfacesCantContainFields is reported.

I'm more with this approach, but instead of reporting on every field usage. We report once and use the property location, not `field` location.

And even then, we'll have a wrong behavior for initializers where we early create the backing field. This will another check and tests.

@github @github What do you think?"
"Instead of using contextual reflection it would be cleaner to just call `AssemblyLoadContext.GetLoadContext(type.Assembly).LoadFromAssemblyName`.

We recommend people stop using the `Assembly.Load` because of its weird behavior in terms of which ALC it loads into (without contextual reflection it relies on caller's ALC which is often times wrong)."
"> No, the transformation itself looks correct to me (well, there is one issue - `GTF_RELOP_JMP_USED` is not guaranteed to be maintained by this phase, so it'll have to be replaced by a check of the user's oper).

"I think this is fundamentally the wrong approach here.  If we are worried about this scenario, we need a declarative way for source-generators to say: i need to process semantic models, please call into me to process that along with the other generators that are need the same.

Then, we aren't caching things and potentially blowing memory badly.  And we're not trying to come up with policies around caching that likely will not hold for arbitrary generators.  This last point is especially important.  This sort of approach doesn't work in general as we never really know what sort of caching strategy will work given arbitrary code execution."
"> Doesn't this break applications by removing a public API?

I think it's actually ok.  It's definitely a strange situation, but it's not a source breaking change because recompiling will just bind to the base method of the same signature, and if it were going to be a binary breaking change, it'd already be breaking, because the newslot method doesn't exist in the actual implementation. The base type has the same method name, and the C# compiler emits calls to this in a way where the runtime will end up just calling the base method, even though this has a new slot, e.g. via:
```
callvirt instance string [System.Net.WebHeaderCollection]System.Net.WebHeaderCollection::get_Item(string)
```
or
```
call instance string [System.Net.WebHeaderCollection]System.Net.WebHeaderCollection::get_Item(string)
```

"> does jit need an ability to deoptimize methods...?

Good question. Profile based optimizations rely on the past being a good predictor of the future. So any sort of profiling scheme is vulnerable to the profile not accurately representing future behavior.

We are using Tier0 to collect counts because it was fairly easy to set up, and provided an easy way to get profile data into the jit, so we could start improving the ways the jit uses profile data. But as you note, that means we only get to observe the first few calls for some methods. It remains to be seen how well (or poorly) this predicts future behavior in general.

I think we will get around to deopt eventually, as we start making stronger bets based on profile data and need the ability to reconsider and reoptimize if we have bet wrong. I don't know if we'd deopt because of poor block layout, though -- I was imagining it would be more for things like guarded (or unguarded) speculative devirtualization."

Do all live range coalescing in genSetScopeInfoUsingVariableRanges to
make sure we catch as many cases as possible. In particular, we were not
coalescing ranges opened in the prolog with other ranges before.

The old logic also seemed incorrect: the end of live var ranges is
exclusive (the comment on it was wrong) which meant that the old logic
would coalesce two ranges that were separated by one instruction. This
means the new logic has more accurate reporting. However, the diff is
still negative because coalescing ranges from the prolog looks to be
more important: on my machine, SPC decreases in size by around 10 KB

@github any idea what might be wrong here?"
"Me: But this feels like we're losing coverage from keys other than this one specific key...

AlsoMe: That's technically true, but there's not a whole lot in these tests that cares.

Me: What if there was something that failed in `AsymmetricDSASignature` because of some heretofore unseen key characteristic, akin to an RSA key having a diminished DP value?

AlsoMe: Then someone'd probably just hit retry and we'd never notice it.

Me: It'd still turn up in a report somewhere?

AlsoMe: The code is 17 years old, and has barely ever changed.  These days, you don't even really like the type existing, much less taking changes in it.  Also, it's DSA.  Does anyone even use DSA? If so, they're... (how should I say it?) ... wrong for doing so.  There's nothing left to test.  It'd have either been found by now, or won't ever be.

Me: Fair enough."

"If that's the case then we should consider renaming both of these methods.  The name simply does not match up to the actual implementation.  Consider this code

99% of developers who look at that line are going to interpret this as determining if `type` is the const modifier. In reality it's detecting if a) it's the const modifier and b) the present language supports it.  The 1% who will understand the behavior are those who realize the name of the method is wrong.

"Hey @github  I'm actually worried about this one, the time function stores a delegate to the underlying getter, but I don't think this test ever worked anyway as the value being stored is this the datetime from the first function, not a getter method to the underlying datetime.

[Here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/libraries/System.IO.FileSystem/tests/File/GetSetTimes.cs#L68) we're creating the time function, but then just immediately storing the [output datetime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/34229/files#diff-de74d261db69a93767732397a82a4f54R63)

Why weren't the existing PNSE configurations erroring then?  Sometimes CCI can get confused about core-assembly and a symptom will be that it emits things like System.String and System.Int32 etc instead of the keywords.  Usually the problem is that the references provided are wrong / imcomplete.

(Correct me if I'm wrong) It looks like you only set these in the constructor. Why not just make them `constexpr` in the namespace?
"The two code paths behave very different in these details. That's why I baked the exception handling into the member acessors.
Reflection does not throw a NRE when a method with value-typed parameter is called with argument null. So there is nothing to catch - Reflection.Emit throws NRE in this case.
Reflection throws ArgumentException when value is not assignable - Reflection.Emit throws InvalidCastException.

Bringing all these details about the member accessor implementation to the level where the delegate is called seems wrong to me.

"Now for a worst-case example, using the _Solarized Dark_ color scheme.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4181424/83972678-7145f080-a8d9-11ea-9d31-2ff4c2de0975.png)

As with the _Xterm_ scheme you can see some ""glitches"" in the 16-color mappings. Only now even the colors are wrong. For example, it thinks the _Solarized_ dark green is closer to a shade of yellow, and the blue looks more like cyan. But again, I don't think that is such a big deal - it's still mapping to a reasonable color.

The unexpected ""black"" spots are worse though. That's because those are colors that appear to be a medium shade of gray, and thus get mapped to index 8 (bright black), but in the _Solarized_ scheme, bright black is the darkest color in the palette, darker even than dark black. Without knowing the palette, there's nothing we can do about that.

And then you've also got the fact that half of the bright colors are just shades of gray. So the bright greens and yellows in the rightmost blocks of the color cube end up getting mapped to various shades of gray. But note that the original algorithm didn't do much better, with those greens and yellows being mapped to red, orange and blue.

Finally there are the shades of gray at the bottom of the test pattern where the middle section appears darker than the start. But again that's just because _Solarized_ has the black and bright black intensities reversed. The mapping in the old algorithm wasn't perfect either, but the shades of gray are at least in the right order.

So yeah, this case is a bit of a mess for the new algorithm, but that's not a huge surprise. And if you're using a _Solarized_ color scheme, then you're probably used to things being broken a lot of the time. 😉"

"> Isn't the result for `IsDynamicCodeCompiled` still wrong when the dynamic code is going to be interpreted?

I don't think so.  It will be `IsDynamicCodeCompiled == false`.

The code in intrinsics.c is only used by the JIT and the AOT compiler.  In the interpreter, `IsDynamicCodeCompiled` is an intrinsic that returns false.  So any interpreted calls to it will return `false`, as expected.  In any code that is compiled ahead of time, it will also be false."

"I was wrong, it's set. I verified that -O (blended) and --Os (opt for size) both use DefaultPolicy and --Ot (opt for speed) uses ExtendedDefaultPolicy in crossgen2. "
The coding style is wrong in this file.
"@github could this be a breaking change?

The generated `Speed` property will be virtual, which means it can be overridden.

If a binary is overriding a virtual readonly property, and then the base property becomes read-write, the override will be wrong since it won't have the setter. I'm not sure mono will complain about this though.

"This feels wrong - having the makefile writing to the `~/.bashrc` file. Can the test code itself check if we are running in a docker container, and then add the switch?"

"Hmmm. Preventing this seems wrong and inconsistent with what `UTF16` formatting does. (`5.ToString(""G99"")` is valid)

The official docs (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings) cover that it produces `Result: The more compact of either fixed-point or scientific notation` and `Precision specifier: Number of significant digits.`

There are notably some other inconsistencies here as well. Integers are missing support for `C`, `E`, `F`, and `P`. `Floating-point` more broadly doesn't support `D` either, but reasonably could (its basically just an alternative to `F0`)"
"I removed the global `foo` above because this PR reverses the decision documented here:

> A local variable would prevent import completions (see `completionsImport_shadowedByLocal.ts`), but a global doesn't.

If I kept the file `/global.d.ts`, you're right, it would still show up, but the imports below would _not_ show up, and this test would be testing the wrong thing."
"this test is a good start.

1. can you add tests for documentation as well?

"I spent a couple hours today trying to convince myself if this check is needed or not, and the more I look at it the more convinced I am that the race condition is different than the original hypothesis

The `EECodeHeapIterator` uses `MethodSectionIterator` to go through all active jitted methods, and it will only return a method if the appropriate index in `HeapList::pHdrMap` is set.

But we only set the index in `pHdrMap` in `EEJitManager::NibbleMapSet`, which is called from `CEEJitInfo::WriteCode`, after the GCInfo is generated.

Either I'm missing something or the real issue is a combination of the freeing happening in the wrong order on all arches, and then pointer tearing on arm archictures because the publishing for codeHeaders happens outside the lock https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/48adb84ddc2f48ae76adae5854f66371d5e6960e/src/coreclr/vm/jitinterface.cpp#L10927

If I run my repro app with the fix to move freeing the code header to after freeing the code data, I no longer hit the assert on x64, which suggests but does not confirm my hypothesis"
"> trying to load the min version first seems wrong to me.

Right, that is a remainder from the times when the minimum version was the version of ICU at the build time."
"@github Not recently, but in Dev16 as a part of the work to delay design-time builds until after project load. I mistakenly thought we could initialize just the files with Roslyn on the background and we wouldn't end up in any UI thread bound calls, but I was wrong. This is an attempt to fix that for this scenario (but not fixing the general desire to not have Roslyn init bound to the UI thread at all, like it is for CPS)."

"> The tests getting enabled in #38948 will need to be disabled again.

"@github Yes that is a known issue.  The current workaround is in the generate layout script
```bash
# Use the following script to:
# - Remove the incorrectly built native binaries above
# - Build the osx-arm64 native binaries for clr+libs
# - Run build-test generatelayoutonly
# - Replace S.P.C.dll w/ the IL version (presumably crossgen for the wrong arch)
# - Remove replace stray x86_64 native binaries (appears to not be needed)

"@github at this point I've reviewed all of the change. I have some remaining feedback about tests but it's small. Mostly opportunities to simplify with `[Theory]` usage and a couple of areas that got missed. There are two bigger items: 

1. The idea of having a pure syntax phase which would facilitate better caching. Think we can handle that as a follow up PR. Once @github confirms I can get an issue filed to track the work. 
2. Understanding why the tracked steps only has `Removed` when a file is deleted vs. having a mix of `Unchanged` and `Removed` [link](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/61293#discussion_r890545938). Suspect this is a bug in the tracking code that we can track as an issue but want @github to verify (or help me understand why my expectations are wrong).

Overall this change is great. Really nice wins. 

Will sign off once we work through the test level feedback and then get the follow up issues filed as merge in the work"
"> I just tried to use this syntax without know it was a thing, and then I found this PR. So I'd say the syntax is intuitive to say the least.

Not everything which is intuitive is a good thing. I think that is was weswigham is trying to say.

"Hi @github, thanks for the review. I will update the PR accordingly, but I just need a little time, because things are kind of crazy right now."
"> Maybe thing's have gotten better since I last tried in macOS world (or maybe I did a bunch of things wrong 😄 ) but the problem with ""data"" keys as I call them is they don't seem to work fully in place of keychain-backed keys. e.g. `CopyWithPrivateKey` on `X509Certificate2` I think was one place that I hit.

I was playing with it today and it's a mixed bag situation.

First of all, the `SecKeyCreateWithData` API documentation states that it requires `kSecAttrKeySizeInBits` which is not true. The implementation doesn't look at it, never looked at it (as far as the published sources go), and even omits it in many of their own regression tests. It's much simpler to use when this is not required. I filed an Apple Feedback to clarify the situation.

Second, it does seem to work for RSA keys even with the item export. On ECC though it hits the problematic code paths in the native code which explain the issues you've hit.

I'll submit a PR later to convert the RSA code paths to use it.

"Ok, I think I get it now. It does look like checking for `entry.AbsoluteExpiration` and resetting `entry.AbsoluteExpiration` back to itself is redundant.

I think the other way holds - if the existing quality wall rejects your changes, you did something wrong. But it isn't guaranteed that there are tests for every scenario. We strive for it, but it isn't guaranteed."

While looking at the Windows failures reported in #62384, #60267, #60204, #60017 I noticed a bunch of new MacOS failures starting from 2021-12-08, which all report `UnauthorizedAccessException`

By default, `LocalAppData` is undefined on Unix, the following line will actually reference to a file named `\NCLTest.Socket.SendPacketsAsync.testpayload` in the working directory of the test execution process:

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/a8c2d1eae1726b1e6ec50716b7d4c34bc21ba96e/src/libraries/System.Net.Sockets/tests/FunctionalTests/SendPacketsAsync.cs#L23

On CI it's a known folder so the path points to stuff like `/private/tmp/helix/working/A48D0921/w/C66409E5/e/System.Net.Sockets.Tests.app/Contents/Resources/\NCLTest.Socket.SendPacketsAsync.testpayload` on Helix Macs. I'm not sure what goes wrong with the access to the above folder, but I believe it's better to use the preferred `TempFile` utility to create temporary files, and this change will likely fix the `UnauthorizedAccessException`, since other tests using `TempFile` seem to be healthy right now.

Also changing the test to use the standard xunit test output instead of the legacy `TestLogging.GetInstance()`.

"> Does this need to be applied to the Pem ones as well?

Per local testing, disabling just these two types (ultimately the base class that powers them) was enough.  It'll get CI off the floor and let my compatriots in the OS group figure out what went wrong."
"> @github when I made the initial [proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/69320#issuecomment-1133587458)

I think you are talking about this :

    {
        yield return item;
    }
    else
    {
        break;
    }
}

I did not follow the initial proposal, because (correct me if I'm wrong) your proposal assumes that when there is no element to take, `GetConsumingEnumerable` should end, whereas the actual code retry taking another element untill adding is complete

"> Sure. What’s great about this is that this thread will continue to run during the ramp up to a high number of threadpool threads. Today the thread pool needs to dequeue the timer callback as threads are slowly being injected into the thread pool (fighting other threads).

The thread could still get preempted. A developer could block too long in a custom IConnectionHeartbeatFeature callback. We could introduce a deadlock. There are a bunch of reasons we should still time OnHeartbeat() and log ""heartbeatslow"" if it takes over a second.

I agree that ""heartbeatslow"" warnings are likely more often caused because bunch of timer callbacks get dequeued in rapid succession as the threadpool works through a backlog of work items, but what's the harm in timing OnHeartbeat()? Are we sure that already-dequeued timer callback *never* gets preempted by the OS for over a second? What's wrong with logging something if and when this does happen?

"> Determined by the caller. The one case in initial binding which still potentially passes true here though is when the nullable type is used explicitly in code. I assume, possibly wrong, that it should generate warnings in that case. 

Yes, that feels inconsistent with other similar places where we report warnings outside of NullableWalker. Like for example in SourceMemberContainerSymbol_ImplementationChecks.cs, SourceComplexParameterSymbol.cs, TypeSymbol.cs, etc.
We can easily check the language version here in the way the first iteration did it.

Basically - I would expact behavior like this:

* `5.*` SDK building `netcoreapp3.*` app will use `3.*` `apphost` and V1 header only
* `5.*` SDK building `net5` app will always use `5.*` `apphost` and V2 header

The presence of the flag means that there will be a combination of `5.*` apphost used on `netcoreapp3.*` - I find that wrong."

I also experimented with a class implementing `IMethodSymbol` and calls to `ISymbolDisplayService` and `IDocumentationCommentFormattingService` but that ended up being too involved. So I decided to copy the `TaggedText[]` of the decimal and use that as a starting point.

It lacks the following features:
* The classification of source and target type as `keyword` is wrong for `Enums`
* The description is a bit misleading. It describes the operator method, but it would be more useful to describe the conversion itself, like ""Explicit cast from int to byte"".
* The description should not contain *of a* and *to a* to avoid grammar issues with type names starting with a vowel.
* Needs to be localized.
* Is `Environment.NewLine` correct here?
* It incorporates the nullable question mark in the method signature `int.explicit operator byte?(int value)` which looks odd (either no ? should be given (that is what user-defined operators do) or both types should have a ?)

"This code appears to correctly modify the array so that there is a single applicable member when overload resolution succeeds. However, when there is more than one most specific candidate, this code may leave in the array some members marked as applicable even though some other member may be more specific (I think). We do have a way of seeing the candidate set through a public API in `SemanticModel` (I think). So it appears we may yield the wrong result in that particular case.

In the case that there is more than one most specific candidate (which will result in an error), I don't mind having the quadratic loop to precisely limit the set of candidates and eliminate those for which there is some more specific candidate. We could still have the code be fast in the non-error case, which is by far more common.

All of this is theory. I would ask @github to please either tell my why my theory is wrong, or craft a test that confirms my suspicion (by having a set of user-defined overloaded operators in a class hierarchy, an ambiguous use of the operator, and using `SemanticModel` to see the not-quite-correct overload set). And if I was right, I think the code should be adjusted, in the more-than-one-candidate case, to eliminate candidates for which some other method is more specific.

"Thanks for providing more feedback. Yes that seems to be happening, and I do agree we need to somehow hack it in that when the editor ""gets focus"" such that not too much is read out. We can aslo ask on NVDA github page for ideas how to potentially achieve this.
Also if we move paramter hints to also use `activeDescendetes` we will have the same issue, once the paremeterHints get closed the editor aria label we get re-read.

A crazy idea which I have and I am not sure if it will work is that we set `ariaHidden=true` on the editor instead of cleaning out its ariaLabel. The focus goes back to the editor, nothing gets read out and after a timeout we remove this `ariaHidden` attribute. That would sort of make the editor invisible to the screen reader for a very brief perioud of time.

"(This is a much larger discussion that doesn't have to be implemented as a part of this PR. So really I'm thinking out loud.)
I'm wondering if we should move `TerminalSettings` over to TerminalSettingsModel. Hear me out:
- if we're making `TerminalSettings` `IInheritable`, might as well move `TerminalSettings` over to TSM. It's a bit weird for us to grab this random file from a separate project, right? haha
- With regards to creating a TermControl preview in Settings UI...
  - I hit a problem today. TSE cannot depend on TermApp because that'd create a circular dependency (TermApp <--> TSE). So I tried making it so that TSE builds a `TerminalSettings` by firing an event to TermApp, but then TermApp would need to somehow get the synthesized `TerminalSettings` object down to the profile page _and_ update on each change. Having `TerminalSettings` be its own project or a part of TSM makes it it so much easier to construct `TerminalSettings` and just have one readily available for a TermControl preview.

What do you think?

The concept of a ""larger scope"" for a type parameter probably needs a clear definition. And I think the suggested fix can esily be adjusted to ignore type parameters like that. However, if we are talking about method type parameters that are becoming type type parameters, then, perhaps, the ""after the substitution"" is the important part in the suggestion.

I think this needs a `(may change semantics)` (or some other wording) note, because this converts specifically defined newline character sequences into whatever the current machine/git repo/etc. happens to be configured to use. If a user checks out a git repo on a mac, runs this refactoring on VS Mac, this could break things.

"@github  In the API review the allowed targets for the attribute were actually discussed quite a bit - I got the feeling that we try to reduce it to the very minimal set possible. Mainly because it gives people direct feedback in VS/build if they got it wrong.

"> Many workloads for which tasks were originally introduced, actually. Consider, for example, parallelized divide and conquer. A worker partitions its work into multiple pieces, queues identical workers to process N - 1 of those pieces, processes its own, and then waits for those other workers to complete. Also think about algorithms that require coordination between those pieces, such as various operations used by PLINQ (e.g. OrderBy) that needs to block each of the workers until they reach a common point so that they can exchange data and all continue on, and what would happen if one of the workers was throttled indefinitely

Today do the implementation of those kick end up doing Task.Wait?

> I think that's the wrong direction, at least for the foreseeable future. If we decided to go with an approach like the one proposed in this draft, I have trouble seeing it as anything other than opt-in, given all of the previously cited concerns, the potential for introducing deadlocks where they weren't previously, the potential for casting way too wide a net, the potential for negatively impacting the throughput of unrelated workloads, etc. _If such a mitigation was added as opt-in, and if enough testing demonstrated it was a good decision for certain workloads, then it could potentially be automatically opted-in for those, e.g. if you felt ASP.NET should always turn this on. Even there, though, I'd be surprised if in the current configuration that was a wise choice.

Yes I have similar fears but I'm looking for solutions. Maybe this isn't this one but there are aspects of this that seem interesting. Say we added a public API to enable this and it was opt-in, I could see the potential for adding a piece of middleware or filters that enables this on the current workitem before the blocking code executed. Something like this:

```C#
[HttpGet(""/blocking"")]
[EnableBlockingMitigation] // This name is terrible
public string BlockingLegacyCodez()
{
      return new WebClient().DownloadString(...); // I know we're never supposed to use this API
}
```

That filter could yield to thread pool to get off the current work item and enable mitigation on a unique workitem that's closer to this code. The equivalent of doing this:

```C#
[HttpGet(""/blocking"")]
public async Task<string> BlockingLegacyCodez()
{
      await Task.Yield(); // Make a new work item
      ThreadPool.EnableBlockingWorkitem();
      return new WebClient().DownloadString(...); // I know we're never supposed to use this API
}
```

"> > The Exception is not bubbled up to host.StartAsync.
> 
> I think that behavior is wrong. We should revert it.

@github - In looking at this again - an `Exception` thrown from a `BackgroundService` was only ever bubbled up to `host.StartAsync` when it was [thrown from](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/50569/files#diff-3f578e113b4e83fd5fe9e0073a4ebdd6230895dfc7429b058c26d6bb5fb47849L65):

```csharp
// Fire IHostedService.Start
await hostedService.StartAsync(combinedCancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
```

Otherwise it was just logged in `HandleBackgroundException`. I believe that this was probably extremely rare, and I wouldn't be surprised if most errors [occurred in](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/50569/files#diff-3f578e113b4e83fd5fe9e0073a4ebdd6230895dfc7429b058c26d6bb5fb47849L79-L87):

```csharp
await backgroundService.ExecuteTask.ConfigureAwait(false);
```

Since it is possible for an error to occur on either call, I intentionally grouped these two together to capture both possible background service failure scenarios. Are you suggesting that we `throw` from within the `TryStartBackgroundServiceAsync`? If so, why bother calling `StopApplication`?

I'm still a bit confused on why we wouldn't call `StopAsync` in the `catch` clause in the `TryStartBackgroundServiceAsync` method.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/53362

This change is fixing the wrong behavior of the Culture Native and Display names. We had the following behavior:
- Display names were cached which is wrong. The display names should be treated as the localized resources and should be retrieved every time using the CurrentUICulture.
- There is some old special case for supplemental culture which is not applying anymore because Windows already using supplemental culture LCID values for some of its built-in cultures. 
- When requesting the native or display names using ICU, if ICU couldn't find a suitable resource for the request, it just return the culture name e.g. `en-US instead of English (United States) ` which is not suitable to use in the UI apps.

The fix here is doing the following:

- For display names now, we use CurrentUICulture to retrieve the name.
- Removed the supplemental culture special case. 
- When requesting the display and native names from ICU, we fallback to English names if couldn't find resources for the requested culture. 
- Added some test

"> @github can you please take a look at the Fuzzlyn-arm64 failure, is it worth investigating?

I've seen it a few times, I don't think it's related to this PR. Seems like either Fuzzlyn can generate extremely large structures or something else is wrong. It's probably the former."
"> I'm not against an internal abstraction here if it helps more than it hurts, but I'm not seeing it at the moment. You mention this will help better address future issues; can you elaborate?

3 things come to mind:

1. There's a reqeuest from the OpenXML team to bring back the `ZipArchive.Flush` method that we didn't port from .NET Framework. The API would unblock some problems they found in System.IO.Packaging APIs. I experimented with adding a `Flush` method, and realized that the behavior would have to be special-cased depending on the mode. `Flush` would do exactly what we currently do inside `Dispose`, minus the disposal of the internal streams. But since the expectation is that the user should be able to continue manipulating the archive and entries after they call `Flush`, then we need to put the streams back into a good state, and this is where I was finding the complications due to the read/create/updaet logic being intermixed.
2. `ZipArchive` also has different behaviors when loading the archive and the entries, which depend on the mode. It would be quite helpful to have a separation of the logic depending on the mode, if we want to fix the memory-related issues (linked in the description).
3. Finally, if we want to add zip64 support, I imagine we would have to split the code even more. I haven't dug deep into this, but my first impression is that this could be another layer of abstraction if we use the strategy pattern (I could be wrong).

> I generally agree with @github here; I'm not seeing what this abstraction is really buying. 

A good alternative @github gave me is to add specialized methods instead, and split the methods into partial files depending on the method. I like the option since I don't have strong arguments for points 2 and 3 yet. So until I can confirm we have an additional abstraction layer besides `ZipArchiveMode` that would require a strategy pattern, we can stick to partial files.

How does that sound?"
"> I think there was more utility back when we thought we would have multi-RDN value support.

Yeah, but we have the wrong shape for that.  The one multi-valued test we have (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/e74c3e812fa5c96dc7ebaff655bff8820f3f9a62/src/libraries/System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates/tests/X500DistinguishedNameTests.cs#L23-L33) shows the encoding:

```
SEQUENCE (1 elem)
  SET (2 elem)
    SEQUENCE (2 elem)
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER 2.5.4.3 commonName (X.520 DN component)
      PrintableString James
    SEQUENCE (2 elem)
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER 2.5.4.10 organizationName (X.520 DN component)
      PrintableString Microsoft
```

If it was a multi-RDN escape hatch then we'd've had just `AddEncoded` which required the input to be a SET( OF).

> I suppose AddEncoded could be removed under the same pretense that multi-RDN was removed: you are doing something interesting / unique and you can probably just use AsnWriter.

Yeah.  Let's just cut it.  If we remember why we wanted it it's easy enough to add back (and already API-Approved)"

"I don't think passing in 1000 endpoints here is viable whether we pre-sort them or not. You're asking us to iterate 1000 endpoints multiple times and process policies on all of them. At that point you're holding it wrong. 

I don't think this is a implementation strategy we should try to enable. If you're writing a CMS with 1000s of endpoints you need to apply some kind of lookup yourself and not *just* use `IEndpointSelectorPolicy`. I haven't heard anyone ask for this."
"I think the reason we didn't `try`/`catch` this before was that we expected that, if any of the `Dispose` calls throws, then that's going to bubble up to be an unhandled exception on the renderer, which is fatal and will dispose everything (including all components) anyway.

Was that reasoning wrong? Could you clarify why?"
"One other sticking point is that there's no guarantee that the same algorithm is used to compute the hash code of a `string` vs. the hash code of a `ReadOnlySpan<char>`. In fact, `Dictionary<string, ...>` _throws away_ the default comparer and uses a specialized string comparer for greater performance. It's definitely solvable, but doing this in a manner that won't regress performance of _existing_ scenarios is a much more complex problem than it appears.

Edit: The reason this matters is that the hash code is needed to compute which bucket the key maps to. If we inadvertently compute the wrong hash code, we could end up in a situation where the dictionary truly does contain some `string` value but we say it doesn't contain the equivalent `ROS<char>` value."
"Wouldn't doing it on a `finally` block the CircuitHost achieve the same result? If something went wrong with the previous call, we should fail and tear-down the circuit, shouldn't we?"
"This seems wrong to me.  THe idea behind this type is that it's long lived, and unbound to any particular cancellation exception we might have gotten for some operation (like the ones we create during 'add using').  If we don't have this cancellation token, and we now use an ambient cancellatoin token passed in by a feature, we will make it so that this type is no longer long lived, and no longer sits patiently in its loop, updating the index on its prescribed schedule."
"The justification is that the implementation is incorrect, and the test carefully tests only one case for which the incorrect implementation happens to work. If you test the existing implementation on a random sequence of data it will be wrong more than 1000 times for every time it gets it right.

The escaping logic in the compilers is today computed on a character-by-character basis. There is not enough information from a single surrogate character to determine whether or not escaping it is necessary, so escaping it is the only correct approach without considering more context.

It might be worth changing the escaping logic by making it more complex such that it scans the sequence of characters and considers each character in the context of the characters that precede it and follow it to determine if escaping is necessary. I don't think that is worth the effort.

"I'm not sure where on the barometer to place this, but it took me a little while to remember that _whether we produce a 0 or a 1_ is based on the receiving type. `_GetModifier` takes a size_t, so gets a 0.

If somebody were to change the type `_GetModifier` accepts, all this code would silently continue working (so long as the type it accepts meets `sizeof(T) == sizeof(size_t)`) but produce the wrong value.

Which is more or less what I expected.  Yay?

No NodeJS dir anywhere in there, though.

Also, re-reviewing [the CG issue](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_componentGovernance/112013/alert/5831478?typeId=6317076), the **Affected pipelines** include:

  * Xamarin.Android (Build and Smoke Test)
  * Xamarin.Android (Dotnet Build and Smoke Test)

which are on the *Windows* machines.

No idea why **Location** is providing Unix-style paths if this is perhaps happening on Windows?

Looks like I'm checking the wrong machine, though."
"I believe `everytime` is intentional because “_you would all be running the latest console bits everywhere everytime_” looks nicer. Yet all dictionaries agree on _everywhere_ and _every time – I don't know the reason for this discrepancy, it's probably explained somewhere on the internet ([Everytime or Every Time?](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/everytime-every-time/)). Other exceptions seem plain wrong.

"`Contract` ""blows up"", meaning we get an actual failure (and watson etc.) so that we know we did something wrong and have to go fix it.   A null check like this masks a logic bug in our code, which can then manifest as broken behavior for users thatw e have no insight on what actually went wrong.  

In general, if something indicates a logic bug in our code, we do not try to be resilient to it.  Rather, we fail early and report the NFW so we can actionably address teh scenario.  This approach is born out by enumerable experiences trying to go the ""be resilient and just trudge along"" route, and how much extra cost that has given us over the years as we've attempted to track down failures and intermittent behavior for users."
"> @github you'd have to look at the output from the test; it's probably a build failure of some sort. The test will create a binlog for the build (the path is printed to the output), which you can view to see where things went wrong.

One of the svg files were too new of a version! I never would have guessed that haha thanks"
actually this comment is wrong. I'm removing it. The correct cases are already articulated in inline comments just below.
"> Lets wait to see the diff. I wonder if the links are correct in the comment. I suspect they won't (but I hope I'm wrong)

Totally forgot to change the links. I'm scratching my head as to why the CI didn't fail regarding the wrong link names, but I will get those fixed"
yeah. also addeventListener has the wrong signature. will need to fix them all.
"Note: This test was simply wrong. Removing either cast to CByte(0) would result in the type of the ternary conditional changing from `Byte` to `Int32`. These should only be marked as redundant if the type of the ternary conditional is already `Int32`.

"This return type is wrong. AFAIK, `module.exports` here should be a `number[]`."
"> That might just be a case of ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"".

That is how I am thinking of this feature. There are cases where the compiler can definitely determine if the user is doing something wrong, but also where it _might_ be doing something wrong. The [`Span<T>.ToArray()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.span-1.toarray) is another example. If a user calls `ToArray()` and `T` is known to be ByRefLike, the compiler could issue a failure. However, if `T` isn't know at compile time then it would be up to the implementer to have handled this appropriately using something like the proposed intrinsi-fication of `typeof(T.).IsByRefLike` in this document. The updated `Span<T>.ToArray()` would look as follows and handle the case at runtime. The other APIs in question would have similar checks.

```diff
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
public T[] ToArray()
{
+    if (typeof(T).IsByRefLike)
+        throw new InvalidProgramException();

    if (_length == 0)
        return Array.Empty<T>();

    var destination = new T[_length];
    Buffer.Memmove(ref MemoryMarshal.GetArrayDataReference(destination), ref _pointer.Value, (uint)_length);
    return destination;
}
```"
The name of this test method is now wrong. But can we just delete these tests now?
">dateTime = dateTime.AddMicroseconds(microsecond); [](http://example.com/codeflow?start=16&length=49)

This is wrong. imaging users passing microseconds equal -10 for example. this should throw but with this code possibly will not throw. 

You need to manually test microseconds, like:

```C#

if ((uint)microsecond >= MicrosecondsPerMillisecond) 
{
    Throw...
}

var dateTime = calendar.ToDateTime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond);
_dateData = dateTime.AddMicroseconds(microsecond)._dateData; // Note, it is wrong to assign _dateData to UTicks.
```"
I don't know if this is the proper way to get the coreclrpal target to build.  It works but I'm not sure if i'm doing something wrong here.
"It's just a proof of concept right now just to catch clearly wrong code. My understanding is that these types are widened, so checking the intersection is potentially wrong."
"Create `dotnet.cjs.mt.lib.js` and do it in build files ?

We need to do something smarter about those `linked_functions` in the future. 
I'm not confident what we have is the best solution.
There is some crazy transormation on it by emscripten."
"Actually, I would think that the real perf gain would be when using it through the LS, since it would run over time and get the chance to be inlined. I might be wrong, but either way it's still probably a good idea.
"
"So, if the programmer omits a type annotation on a `this` parameter, you will think there was _no_ `this` parameter and get your parameter count adjustments wrong below. You need to track the presence of a this parameter separately from its type. When the type annotation is missing you should use `unknownType`. Also, you can just use `getTypeFromTypeNode(param.type)` instead of `getTypeOfSymbol`.

"In the meantime I've moved all call sites I could find to the new API (where it was possible without potentially introducing new/different exception types, and where targeting allowed it): 044c710 minus 300b725

I've also consolidated the various different hex encoding/decoding implementations across the libraries to the ones in the internal common class `HexConverter` (25d222e). If you'd like to see those kinds of changes in a separate PR, then I'll revert it in this branch.
If we decide to merge this PR as is (after re-review of course) then there are only very few hex encoding/decoding implementations left. Those are not consolidated here because they:
- are used by projects that still target pre-`Span<T>` TFMs
- do more than just hex encoding/decoding (e.g. handle octal strings as well)
- are in test code and adding including `HexConverter` to test projects felt ""wrong""

"> Currently, we wait for these descendants only when the user does not provide any timeout value, meaning that the user can wait up to infinity. I don't believe that this behavior should be changed. It's by design.

By design means this is intentional.
If a user kills a process, why would he then want to wait up to infinity to read its output?

This is how I came to making this PR:

msbuild has some code like this:

```cs
process.Kill();
bool exited = process.WaitForExit(timeout);
```

The timeout is here to avoid the the infinite wait when a grand child still holds the terminal.

The msbuild repo also had a long standing open issue where things went wrong for an unclear reason that was hard to reproduce.

The root cause was a bug in the `exited` `false` path, which was very unlikely, but not impossible, to occur."
"@github The problem is not the lifetime of the strings themselves, the problem is the life-time of the objects allocated between these forever live objects.

# What might go wrong?

Let's say you have a scenario where you do something like this.

JIT a method (and therefore allocates some string literals on POH)
run some code (and therefore allocates maybe some objects on POH), and then
JIT another method (and therefore allocates some string literals on POH)

The POH will look like this.

```
...[string-from-method-1][object1][object2][string-from-method-2][string-from-method-2]...
```

The strings from methods never go away, so they are stuck. By themselves, they don't cause fragmentation. The problem is that object 1 and object 2 might not be needed anymore. Currently, we need a gen2 to eliminate them, so if there is an object 3 allocation before that gen 2 GC happens, it won't be fit in that location. Even after the gen 2 GC, those holes might be small and won't fit future allocation, and that space is practically done and be wasted forever. The fact that we need to wait until the next gen2 GC makes it less than ideal if we use it as if it is malloc/free.

> Opportunity - does it make sense to enable a user to free a managed object so that it gets into the free list right away for LOH/POH objects without having to wait until the next gen 2?

That also explains why it is a really bad idea for collectible assemblies. When a collectible assembly is unloaded, all the associated strings will be eligible for collection, and the collection will create lots of tiny holes (most strings are probably error messages, maybe 200 bytes or less?). We can imagine it would be hard to reuse those holes.

# How do I fix it?

One way to optimize POH utilization is to make sure all objects allocated there are long-lived. Either they are actually being used (like the strings), or they are pooled so that we reuse them instead of creating holes and allocates again. 

> Opportunity - does it make sense to have a single shared pool of pinned buffer allocated on the POH so that could be reused by all libraries that need pinned buffers? 

Another way to optimize for POH utilization is to allocate objects of similar lifetimes together in time. So that we can create a big hole when they go away, and a big free list block is much more likely to be reusable.

> Opportunity - does it make sense to enable a user to manually specify a collection of objects to have a similar lifetime so that we don't allocate others with a different lifetime in the same (segment/regions)?

"> Hmm - that's odd. I would have expected the app to exit. I don't think this is a mode that we should fall back into.

I agree with @github. The behavior should be deterministic and not surprising to the users. In genral, we always fail fast if anything goes wrong. This gives the user the user to know what is wrong and fix it instead of having the user experience multiple failures during the runtime. We'll need to have a failure message be clear though. "

"It’s important because caching the wrong version of a file is bad - you can’t easily recover from that without manually clearing caches, which is impossible to explain to most end users. The hash check protects users from this situation, so at worst they can reload the page to recover. 

Consider visiting the site at the same moment that a new version is being deployed. Half the assemblies are the old versions, then the second half comes from the new versions. This likely means a broken app, or at least undefined behaviour. Without the hash check this combination of files would get cached and that user would be stuck with the errors. With the hash check, the initial load fails which is good as it prevents the undefined behaviour, then on the next visit the user gets and caches a working state. 

Same general situation if you have multiple front end servers and no client affinity. If you’re incrementally rolling out updates, we want to detect the case where you load an inconsistent set of resources because the requests were handled by an incompatible collection of servers. "

Don't discount the possibility that all those other loops are just wrong :)

This would not be a good option going forward though. VSCode itself is exploring to enable a sandbox option from Electro that prevents any node.js code to be executed in the window. My hope was that the work you do can benefit both web and the future sandboxed desktop environment. I would want this solution to support all encodings in both web and sandboxed desktop if possible. If there is a reason we cannot support this for some encodings, we should understand why that is and come up with a custom solution if possible. I thought that `iconv-lite` through webpack would support all encodings because there are no native dependencies, but please correct me if that assumption was wrong. E.g. if we need node.js for the UTF-16 conversion, we should try to write our own converter if possible.

> Is loading from file system crucial for us when testing nativeTextFileService?

Yeah I think for desktop I would like to preserve that because it will test the actual stack down to the disk. However, we have a way to register file system providers and we could simply swap out the disk based provider with an in-memory one here:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/b8f63e9ebeaee7f6117476bb52abb270bed32adb/src/vs/workbench/services/textfile/test/electron-browser/textFileService.io.test.ts#L54

In other words, all those tests could run fine in web if the file system provider registered is one that is in-memory for web. For example we have one here:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/b8f63e9ebeaee7f6117476bb52abb270bed32adb/src/vs/platform/files/common/inMemoryFilesystemProvider.ts#L53

> It looks like AbstractTextFileService only uses what is defined in common, but itself is in browser. > Is it intentional? Should it be moved to common?

It cannot move currently due to:

Master currently uses the 5.0-RC1 targeting and runtime pack: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/543cb488437ea0b05a58e3297214a0c9fb2064ea/src/installer/tests/Assets/TestUtils/TestProjects.targets#L20. If I got this right, then https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/543cb488437ea0b05a58e3297214a0c9fb2064ea/src/installer/tests/Directory.Build.targets#L16 is publishing the entire bundle to disk which is then used for the test invocation.

Based on that I don't see how changing the tfm would impact whether we run against the live built runtime. I'm not an expert on the installer subset so please correct me if I'm wrong here."
"I don't think we should remove this call.

The `init_logging_categories()` invocation in `JNI_OnLoad()` allows *global* settings to be processed, but not per-package settings.  This *is* noted in the comment in `JNI_OnLoad()`, but this is basically removal of existing functionality.

If we call `init_logging_categories()` *twice* -- once in `JNI_OnLoad()` and once here -- then existing functionality is retained, while also allowing ""global"" state to be used before `Java_mono_android_Runtime_init()` is invoked.

It should also be safe to call `init_logging_categories()` twice; at least, I don't see anything obviously wrong with doing so."
"What we are trying to achieve is to generate an assembly. My understanding of source generators is that they would generate code which would then be included in the project which is being compiled (please correct me if I am wrong).
The idea here is to create a stand alone assembly which contains all the resource ids. But can be easily swapped out with the final version once we know what all the final app resource id values are.

Hope that makes sense."
"You are right, the code is not guaranteeing against null, but somehow [PropertyValueCollection[index]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.propertyvaluecollection.item?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0) and [PropertyValueCollection.Add(object value)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.propertyvaluecollection.add?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0#exceptions) both documented to be non null (it says it throws ANE for null value). Literally for all references we are suppressing the return value from `(string)PropertyManager.GetPropertyValue(context, rootDSE, PropertyManager.DnsHostName)!` which also illustrates the intention was `non-null`, there is something wrong here or we are missing something."
"@github Sorry about the delay! You happened to catch us at exactly the wrong week - everyone on the team is basically offline for the entirety of the 23rd-29th. I can promise that tomorrow, there's gonna be a _lot_ of discussion about this PR, because it's frankly incredible"
"Hi @github and @github 

I am consuming this change in the latest version of Visual Studio Preview 17.3. Preview 1.1 using Maui (.NET 6).

I can confirm that the test using the badssl website with self-signed certificate works and gets correctly bypassed, thanks for the change!

In fact, every common certificate problem they have in their website works with the validation callback bypassing cert errors, except for the [wrong host example](https://wrong.host.badssl.com/)

This scenario, along with all others, were working before, but this particular one is, unfortunately, a blocker for me. I believe you will be able to repro it on your side as well by attempting to access that URL.

Follows the exception I get after using the validation callback to bypass the certificate errors in the wrong host website from badssl:
System.Net.WebException
  Message=Hostname wrong.host.badssl.com not verified:
    certificate: sha1/1fBSv4IoEephjuel/BGL9TBSEgk=
    DN: CN=*.badssl.com
    subjectAltNames: [*.badssl.com, badssl.com]

"I'll not pretend I understand everything in here, but this struct `CredentialConfig` is created to correspond to `QUIC_CREDENTIAL_CONFIG`:

If I understand it correctly, there are 2 layers: struct with TYPE, FLAGS, etc. and within it a union with different ways to define the certificate itself.

"I'm not 100% convinced the AOT compiler can get here, after all.  Let's drop it. The AOT compiler will break in CI if I'm wrong.

(Same thing for cleanup platform state).

"
Wrong indentation
"I considered that but for now decided against it. It's not inherently wrong to ask for a key on a non-deterministic build, we just have to meet the contract that it never compares equal. I also worried that it would create friction points for consumers where they have to keep taking different paths whether a specific option was passed to the compiler. 

I actually started wondering if the opposite was needed. Essentially make the output deterministic even if the options weren't deterministic. Consider the C# IDE case as motivation for this. They are trying to determine equivalence between open / closing the IDE and remote sessions. That shouldn't all fall apart if the customer didn't use deterministic builds. It also seems odd to call `WithDeterminism(true)` before calling the API. Possible better to just ignore that option in the output.

"> Why does this not apply to all of the other fixers and refactorings we offer?

It's my opinion here that this is a very rare, but explicit, trigger that indicates the user intends to use a file-scoped-namespace.  The trigger specificity, and the lack of overlap with any other constructs means we can specialize this as something explicit we do.

>Also, why doesn't this logic apply to the two namespaces, or nested namespaces scenario? If the reasoning is ""the user typed a semicolon, they must want file scoped namespaces"", then why not also just convert the first namespace in the file, and the user can move the second one to another file afterwards?

This is a good question.  Primarily I was concerned about actually breaking code and putting the user in a space that they didn't know how to fix.  Namely that they then might trigger ""move to file"" and things might go wrong because it would take the new *nested* interpretation instead of hte original sibling interpretation.

We also checked the C# repos we have access to and found that ""single namespace + type"" is the 99.9 case (i think 99.97), so it felt this was hitting a reasonable sweet spot here :)"
The coding style is wrong in this file.
This is wrong. Some of these libraries aren't part of WindowsDesktop's targeting pack anymore.
"Done - added a report and catch to the deserialization path so that we know when it goes wrong.  Since intellicode is providing the json, we definitely want to be notified if it is malformed."
"Yes, you are right I looked at a wrong place. The essence of the change is to handle `frame.Type == FrameType.RstStream && ((RstStreamFrame)frame).ErrorCode == 0x8` the same way as `frame == null`."
"I was wrong about this :) this needs to be restored to ensure we produce the correct metadata name in some cases, particularly for synthesized types."
"this seems wrong e.g. bunch of spaces added to where they should not be. "
I believe `isStringOrNumberLiteralExpression(node.initializer) || isSimpleLiteralEnumReference(node.initializer) || node.initializer.kind === SyntaxKind.TrueKeyword || node.initializer.kind === SyntaxKind.FalseKeyword` will already be false if `node.initializer.kind === SyntaxKind.BigIntLiteral`. Am I wrong?
"Also, correct me if I'm wrong but passing in a ref to a the cached behavior should be safe even in multi-threading scenarios since even if two threads happen to try to evaluate the case behavior they would have both set it to the same value so I believe concurrency should not be a concern AFAIK"
"Oh! Red alert! Two things:
1. @github: The schema correctly shows the values of the SuppressionStates enumeration as ""suppressed"", ""suppressedInSource"". But the code gen hints file gives the enumeration constant names as ""SuppressedInSource"", ""SuppressedInBaseline"", so the generated file SuppressionStates.cs is wrong. I'll fix that.
2. @github: The interpretation of the SuppressionStates enum is subtle. Every result that is suppressed, for whatever reason, should have the value ""suppressed"" in the ""suppressionStates"" array. Those results that are suppressed because of an in-source suppression should _also_ have the value ""suppressedInSource"" in the array. I can explain offline the reasoning behind that.

So, since in Roslyn every suppression you see is a source-level suppression (that's right, isn't it?) your code should be

```
            _writer.WriteArrayStart(""suppressionStates"");
            _writer.Write(""suppressed"");
            _writer.Write(""suppressedInSource"");
```

... resulting in

```
            ""suppressionStates"": [ ""suppressed"", ""suppressedInSource"" ]
```

"My point wasn't that i cared about the name.  it was that i was uncertain if this method was on the right object.  i.e. you're sayign ""AnalyzerService remove the cached data for this workspace"".  Rather than just asking the analyzer itself to do that.  Since you created the analyzer, it made sense to me that you would then be the one asking it to clean up.

Now: i could def be wrong here, and putting this functionality on the service may be the right thing.   However, i'm looking for information/explanation to help me understand why this is the right location.

"An alternate approach is to use the warning to trigger, but still have the fix compute all the changes necessary.  There's nothing wrong with that approach.  The real questions is whether we feel that people will want to add each node one at a time, or will they want to do it in one fell swoop.  I'm leaning toward the latter.  But i don't feel strongly.

This code also seemed wrong before -- it would not include all the debug information in some cases.
"I haven't been able to figure out the remaining x86 test failures.  With BMI1 and LZCNT enabled on a compatible processor, this should be a zero-diff change on the JIT side, and only the subtraction->xor change to `BitOperations.Log2` on the managed side.  However, I have a `System.Memory` test that fails reliably on x86 with my PR build.  That particular test only makes use of `BitOperations.TrailingZeroCount`, and disabling BMI1 does switch the TZCNT to BSF as expected... then it fails in exactly the same way.

I tried running a jit-diff against the base of my branch, but I get an error about the JIT being the wrong version (is that because of the GUID change?).  Running the test with COMPlus_JitDisasm, the jitted code is identical right up to the point the baseline completes the test and the PR build throws an exception.

I'll do another debug session on it tomorrow, but for now I'm stumped."

<hr />

Three bugs being fixed here:
1. The SlideCursorToStartOfBuffer method is incorrectly assuming that the buffer is filled to its end (that m_Buffer.Length = m_CharsRead).  As a result, two things happen.  First, we copy more data than is needed to the temporary buffer; that's just unnecessary but not harmful.  But second, when it issues a read to fill the remainder of the buffer, it does so at the wrong position, both leaving zeros in the buffer that end up getting parsed as real data and losing real data from the end.
2. IncreaseBufferSize assumes m_CharsRead = m_Buffer.Length, which may not be the case.  As with (1), this can result in it reading into the wrong part of the array and leaving garbage that gets processed.
3. IncreaseBufferSize is always increasing the buffer size, even if only a small portion of the buffer is used.  This can then result in the whole operation failing when it repeatedly increases the buffer size and ends up failing due to ticking over the max buffer threshold.

(1) doesn't exist in .NET Framework 4.8 but (2) and (3) do.  (1) is easily triggered by a stream that sporadically doesn't produce all the data requested; (2) and (3) end up needing a stream that frequently produces much less than requested.  This PR fixes all three.

Without the fixes included, here is how the tests being added here fail on main:

"@github, I am encountering a weird issue in our CI testing.

Right now, this PR includes a couple of changes where I intentionally crash or return a wrong return code in some tests. The goal is simply to make sure the tests are actually run and validated.

I tried a few times, but I just can't make a GC test to fail the CI. The tests are supposed to fail on every platform, but it doesn't. If I ran the generated cmd file locally it fails locally."
"> what functionality should we expect from the file system in WASM? I assume setting permissions is expected to fail and such tests should skip there?

It seems to be partially supported. See [FS.chmod(path, mode)](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html#FS.chmod):

`The underlying implementation does not support user or group permissions. The caller is always treated as the owner of the folder, and only permissions relevant to the owner apply.`

[FS.open(path, flags[, mode])](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html#FS.open):
`The underlying implementation does not support user or group permissions. The file permissions set in mode are only used if the file is created. The caller is always treated as the owner of the file, and only those permissions apply.`

Am I crazy? It doesn't look like it's actually possible for `builder` to be null here.
Have trouble believing the previous `Exclude` item was wrong. Instead the ref/ project shouldn't provide metadata in `@(ReferencePathWithRefAssemblies)`.
"Yeah, I mixed up the extensions. Using signalr.client.java.Tests.javaproj would also have been wrong❔ Please file an issue to ship that.

"> I though they had to be evaluation time constant but that might be wrong: https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/blob/c954a632f74afdac9118a1f505257107789ff00e/docs/up-to-date-check.md#customization talks about a target. So it might be doable to add the NativeContent item to UpToDateCheckInput after RAR/design-time RAR. @github, that might be worth clarifying in that doc.

@github yes, you can modify the set of `UpToDateCheckInput/Output/Built` items via the targets specified in those docs. We use design-time build data for that.

I'm unclear on the clarification you're after though.

> I'm confused by ""Note that UpToDateCheckOutput exists but is deprecated and only maintained for backwards compatability."" in the docs.

@github I know you edited this, but regardless: you're right, this is confusing. I've removed mention of the deprecation in https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/pull/7840. Technically `UpToDateCheckOutput` is redundant, but in practice it's less confusing to allow its use, and we can't remove it anyway.

> Hmm I've just realized it's the VS build, not command-line, it's harder to get a decent binlog that involves both projects. Not sure how to investigate this. If you keep building, does it still rebuild every time?

@github since then you pointed me to the use of `MSBuildDebugEngine` environment variable for full-fidelity binlogs, as described in https://github.com/dotnet/project-system-tools#getting-higher-fidelity-logs-from-vs

@github can you suggest a solution filter and project to test the no-output case with? I've burnt my budget today on trying to get the solution building locally. Narrowing to a subset of projects might be helpful."

"Ah, you're right: this is the wrong repo.

My goal: I'm writing an NPM package for [multiplexing streams](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerdbank-streams) to work as a companion to your vscode-jsonrpc package. I already have it defined in a .NET library and of course I want cancellation support. I certainly do not want to redefine cancellation tokens as your package has already done it. My package does not require JSON-RPC itself, but it depends on vscode-jsonrpc the package in order to get cancellation tokens. But I need the functionality that this PR adds (albeit to the wrong repo) to be complete.

So it seems I should close this PR and open one against the right repo. And if you'd entertain the idea, perhaps I can start a new repo with all your cancellation token code in it as a new package, then send a PR to this and/or the vscode-languageserver-node repo to consume the new one so you have just one code base for cancellation tokens.

"@github I guess I can't figure out anymore how I originally fixed the issue. 😐
Due to that I'll now add a special handling for `^@` using the old and proven test for `vkey == VkKeyScanW(0)`.

One quick question regarding this PR though: Should I revert my addition of `ToUnicodeEx`?
It's benefit is that it can properly handle shift keys. For instance this PR can differentiate between:
* <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+.</kbd> which yields `^[^.` and
* <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+.</kbd> which yields `^[^:`

The current solution with `MapVirtualKeyW` only supports the unshifted character `.`.
Another benefit is that after merging this PR we can remove _all_ of [this special handling altogether](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/ea1bb2ed9359fcc6ded32ad11a8cab544b91ae0e/src/terminal/input/terminalInput.cpp#L347-L416).
Since `ToUnicodeEx` supports Shift we can now use this to easily differentiate between `Ctrl+Alt+/` and `Ctrl+Alt+?` as well. All of the `VkKeyScanW` based code can thus be removed.

But the downside to the `ToUnicodeEx` based solution is that it changes the current behavior slightly:
When you now press <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+A</kbd> it'll technically generate `^[^a` (i.e. lowercase ""a"").
Due to [the way Ctrl masking works](https://garbagecollected.org/2017/01/31/four-column-ascii/) I _believe_ that all currently supported Ctrl+Alt combinations should produce the same output as they did before though.

What are your thoughts about this?
I'd personally go ahead with `ToUnicodeEx` because it supports the Shift key and it allows us to clean up `_searchWithModifier` later on. But since I'm not familiar with MS internals, I cannot properly estimate what the risk factor for getting something wrong in this component and changing existing behavior is."

In general this is true. For example if we even see environment variables being manipulated from within individual unit tests then that is highly suspicious. In this case though we are manipulating an the module initializer level so that effectively means it's setting it at the process level. 

The one part I'm worried about though is there is the potential for a subtle timing issue. Essentially imagine if DiaSym gets loaded before the module initializer runs. Then it will potentially load from the wrong place and there is no protection or detection for that.

Thanks @github❕"
"Wrong direction. @github "
"@github , I dug into it a lot deeper last night, asp.net is obviously doing the right thing.  F# obviously has a bug.

The net5.0 is a red-herring.

The F# Compiler has always done a thing that is pretty icky, that Roslyn doesn't really do.  It was originally done for usability reasons to make the command line compile easy for developers to manage when typing ````fsc program.fs```` and also to make ````fsi.exe```` not require a bunch of ````#r ""references""```` for framework assemblies.

When we originally did the coreclr port of fsc this behavior was omitted, but over time, much of it has crept back in.

The F# compiler tries to acquire the framework assemblies at the start in order to do that it has a bunch of horrible probing code.  The xcopied coreclr + global.json scenario is just not consistently and well followed by fsc.exe and fsi.exe

What is going wrong in the case shown above is actually two bugs.

1. We appear to be finding the wrong ````dotnet.exe```` we are executing the global one from program files instead of the xcopied version.
2. Even if we got that correct (which we don't) a later step which then tries to get the contents of the pack directory would only examine packs from the global dotnet location rather than merging them with the xcopied packs folder in order to find the correct set of framework reference assemblies as specified by the global.json

So in short ... F# is buggy in the presence of an xcopied netsdk and global.json file.

Thanks for providing more feedback. Yes that seems to be happening, and I do agree we need to somehow hack it in that when the editor ""gets focus"" such that not too much is read out. We can aslo ask on NVDA github page for ideas how to potentially achieve this.
Also if we move paramter hints to also use activeDescendetes we will have the same issue, once the paremeterHints get closed the editor aria label we get re-read.

A crazy idea which I have and I am not sure if it will work is that we set ariaHidden=true on the editor instead of cleaning out its ariaLabel. The focus goes back to the editor, nothing gets read out and after a timeout we remove this ariaHidden attribute. That would sort of make the editor invisible to the screen reader for a very brief perioud of time.

For other fixes: no problem, no need for appologies :)

"Yes, it will keep all the Sum overloads. It is possible to fully specify the exact method, but it really complicates the signature. And in my opinion, makes this a lot more risky. We do get linker warnings if the method can't be resolved. But if we get the wrong one, we could have a bug.

For example:

```C#
[DynamicDependency(""Where`1"", typeof(Enumerable))]
```

would now become:

```C#
[DynamicDependency(""Where`1(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{``0},System.Func{``0,System.Boolean})"", typeof(Enumerable))]

"I don't think this is the right place to be doing this. You're deferring the viewport size, but that's not the same thing as the buffer size. I don't know if this is good enough to make the Terminal alt buffer work (I haven't looked at that side), but in cohost the results are a bit bonkers. For example, try something like this:

```
printf ""\e[?1049h"" # Switch to alt buffer
printf ""\e[8;24;60t"" # Make the window narrower (assuming 80x24 shrinking to 60x24)
printf ""\e[?1049l"" # Switch back to the main buffer
```

I'd expect the main buffer to keep that 60x24 size, but what you get is a 80 width buffer in a 60 width window. In other cases it'll just do nothing at all.

And ideally this would be using the same mechanism as the existing `_fAltWindowChanged` deferred sizing, otherwise there are bound to be weird results when you mix the too. I don't know how feasible that is though.

"> Do you want the output of the tool to explain how typemaps work and what they are? 

No, not the *output of the tool*;  The `README.md` of the tool.  Which is why this comment thread started on the `README.md`.

And again, I'd be happy to write up that description, I just wasn't sure what some of the values were supposed to mean.

For example, my initial Hello World build did no linking, and thus was *huge* (yay?), with 6062 Java-to-managed entries and 5376 Managed-to-Java entries.

This should be ~everything in `Mono.Android.dll`, right? (Perhaps not?  There are 10848 TypeDefinitions within `Mono.Android.dll`, though not every typedef is a distinct binding, so ""half-ish"" might be a sensible value.)

So why don't any of these entries appear to produce output in the `Is-Generic-Type?` column?  Or am I missing something?  I thought we needed the `generic` column for e.g. `Android.Runtime.JavaList<T>`?

…which oddly isn't present?!

```
% grep JavaList x/typemap-v1-Debug-X86_64-managed.txt
Android.Runtime.JavaList, Mono.Android	java/util/ArrayList		duplicate entry
```

There *is* a generic type present, but it doesn't have anything in the `Is-Generic-Type?` column:

```
% grep JavaArray x/typemap-v1-Debug-X86_64-managed.txt
Android.Runtime.JavaArray`1, Mono.Android	mono/android/runtime/JavaArray		
```

Why doesn't `JavaArray<T>` have a value for `Is-Generic-Type`?

For that matter, why is `JavaArray<T>` the only generic type in here?

```
% grep '`' x/typemap-v1-Debug-X86_64-managed.txt
Android.Runtime.JavaArray`1, Mono.Android	mono/android/runtime/JavaArray

"From the perspective of the analyzer ALC there are essentially two different questions that it needs to answer for a given assembly path that it's asked to load. 

1. Is this an assembly that should be handled by the default ALC? 
2. Is this an assembly that was specified via `/analyzer` and hence valid to *attempt* to load here? 

It is unclear based on the method name here which of the questions this is satisfying. Given that it is on the `AnalyzerAssemblyLoader` type though likely this handles case (1) above. 

If so though then specifying a file path is likely the wrong parameter type. Instead I would expect `AssemblyName` as the parameter, or even just a `string` representing the simple name. That is all the information required to answer (1) above. 

Essentially I was expecting something along the lines of: 

```c#
/// <summary> 
/// Determines if this <see cref=""AssemblyName""/> is the responsibility of the default <see cref=""AssemblyLoadContext"" /> 
/// to load. 
/// </summary>
internal bool ShouldLoadInDefaultContext(AssemblyName assemblyName);

"I'd argue that is was a fix after the fact, not a consideration when the feature coding was done.

Now there's nothing wrong about putting performance first, it made a lot of sense for the original scenarios that netcore targeted. This is also true for mono. There's a lot of code, even in the Xamarin years, where performance alone (without size) was considered.

Expending the scenarios to include mobile means that code examples (like your linke) will become more common (at build time or thru the linker).

Ideally new code will consider both perf/size and not assume existing code did the same :)"
">_lazyBackingFieldSymbolForFieldKeyword [](http://example.com/codeflow?start=63&length=38)

This feels like a move to the wrong direction. It looks like now we can end up with two backing field symbols at the same time. One is created for the initializer, another is created for the ```field``` keyword. Not only we increase the amount of information we store for a property symbol, we also create confusion with two distinct field symbols to work with and choose between. 
I assume that this change was made to be able to distinguish tree states:
1. We haven't created a backing field and we don't know if we need it. 
2. We haven't created a backing field, but we know that we don't need it. 
3. We created a backing field.

As I indicated in one of the earlier threads, we can distinguish all tree states with just one field by using a sentinel value that indicates the ""unknown"" state (null value become a ""known"" state when the field is not needed). Here is the quote: ""Usually, we don't use any additional flags in order to be able to track three states like that. Instead, we use sentinel values to represent uninitialized/unknown state. See ```SourceMemberMethodSymbol._lazyIteratorElementType```, for example.""

Given that it is hard to create a dummy value of ```SynthesizedBackingFieldSymbol```. I suggest doing the following:
- Add ```static private readonly _sentinel = new object();```
- Change ```_lazyBackingFieldSymbol``` as follows ```private object _lazyBackingFieldSymbol = _sentinel;```.
- The field value should be updated only if its value is equal to ```_sentinel``` value. ```InterlockedCompareExchange``` can help with that.
- A simple check against ```_sentinel``` value (instead of a null value) can be used to test if we are still in an unknown state and have some work to do.
- We might need to record an extra information about whether the symbol was created by constructor. That can be recorder in the ```SynthesizedBackingFieldSymbol``` the same way we record whether it was created for a ```field``` keyword.

"This is going to be a problem if the split did not return with 2 items in it. To avoid  surprises, test the length, if it is not the correct, exit 1 stating the reason. Otherwise we might get a $null. Pwsh does not throw exceptions when you index wrongly an array, for example:
```pwsh
$foo = @(""one"", ""two"")
$result = $foo[3]
if ($null -eq $result) {
    Write-Host ""You've got a null value!""
}
```
Because you are getting null, you get the wrong path. "
">nameof [](http://example.com/codeflow?start=95&length=6)

The presence of `nameof` here makes no difference because we are not speculating on the resulting ```InvocationExpressionSyntax```. This confuses the reader and because of that potentially sets wrong expectations."
"Unfortunately the packaging fails [which I anticipated] by having the symlinks point to wrong location:
```
filipnavara@172-4-1-17 app % ls -l /Library/Frameworks/Xamarin.Mac.framework/Versions/Current/lib/mono/Xamarin.Mac/RedistList/
total 0
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  161 Mar 23 07:57 FrameworkList.xml -> /Users/builder/azdo/_work/1/s/maccore/release/_mac-install/Library/Frameworks/Xamarin.Mac.framework/Versions/7.11.0.225/lib/mono/4.5/RedistList/FrameworkList.xml
```

I suppose I need to modify it to make the symlink with absolute path.

Is there any way to make the packages locally? Or can you give me pointer on how the other symlinks are handled? I also have an alternative solution without symlinks but I would like to understand the process nevertheless."
"Should we enforce in the runtime that the field passed to `CreateSpan` is always of a locally defined type and the packing matches the alignment (unless ref emitted, I guess)?

That way we won't have IL Linker/crossgen2 breaking code that works in the absence of those tools. There's still a slight chance that the alignment in metadata is wrong, but it eliminates some of the risk. E.g. Roslyn sometimes avoids introducing the PrivateImplementationDetails type if it can use a primitive type and who knows if that codepath could kick in."
"Ah, the beauty of ""Why didn't we have tests for this?"". ""We do, they just expected the wrong behavior"" :-)"
"I'm still getting used to the way we use intersection types in TS, so pardon me if this is a dumb question: why return the extra property using an intersection type and then pass it on as a separate parameter?  Also, why not actually add it to the type?  To avoid modifying the exported interface?"
Can we add some assert here that we never get non-generic IEnumerable interface. Just to protect against any wrong future use of this method.
"Right, things have already gone very wrong if think we have a tailcall with a retbuf that can be optimized with this optimization.
I will just revert this change, we will hit the assert inside of `gtCallGetDefinedRetBufLclAddr` if the flag is set and we don't have a retbuf."
"Correct me if I am wrong but a bad guessing is not really a problem - it just most likely will cause the first ""reserve"" probe to fail - we'll append 4mb to the address for the next probe 🤷‍♂️"
"Are you sure? It could be that rather than choosing a method with the wrong
signature to add to the event that the wrong event had been chosen.

"We want existing ruleset files to work cross platform - so that users can open existing projects in Xamarin Studio on Mac, for example. So we need to handle both separators.

How about we first check if the file exists as specified. If it doesn't let's make the `\` to `/` replacement in the original string (before we expand env vars) and repeat the process. This won't handle crazy corner cases like mixed separators in Linux-mounted Windows partitions, but I think that's fine.

BTW, I noticed we call `ExpandEnvironmentVariables`. I bet Linux implementation of this method doesn't handle %VAR% syntax, or does it? I guess with some luck not many customers actually use this feature and leave it Windows specific for now. Perhaps file an issue to track this as a potential cross platform problem.

It really feels like a leaking abstraction. If my whole project is defined in TypeScript, why am I needing to reference JS files, that's basically a runtime concern in my opinon.

I also _quite_ dislike the need to specify a file extension in the first place. It is a DX regression from where we are today IMHO, and is not common in other programming languages.

In summary I would hope the TS compile can convert non-suffixed imports into `*.js` suffixed imports as part of the transpile step and keep the DX experience a lot cleaner.

> [EnableBlockingMitigation]

From a ""make sure we don't negatively affect unexpected things"" perspective, I'd be happier with that, assuming it wouldn't require anything in the runtime to do reflection on everything to look for things that might have such an attribute.  It of course still requires someone to know there's a problem, what the problem is, and what solutions there are for addressing it: at that point, we're limiting ourselves to the subset of problems where the developer is prevented from actually doing the ""right thing"" (e.g. they're forced to implement a sync interface and have only async tools at their disposal to do so) rather than the subset where they don't realize they're doing the ""wrong thing"".  From a complexity and impact perspective, while I do understand the appeal of a detect-bad-actors-and-throttle-them approach, I still think we should first be looking at and testing out simpler approaches, like tweaks to thread injection strategy we've talked about previously (e.g. ramp up beyond ProcessorCount faster than we do today)."

The goal of this PR is to enable [pipeline-caching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/caching?view=azure-devops) for build scenarios of coreclr and libraries. In future, we would like to extend it for scenarios like building test, Mono and to some extent test execution. 

## Overview

The idea behind pipeline caching is simple. After the artifacts of a particular job is produced, store it in an Azure cache against a particular ""cache key"". If there is a subsequent run that happens in the pipeline (related or unrelated to the original run), and if the ""cache key"" matches, the job will simply download the cached contents and skip producing the artifacts entirely, saving us some machine time. In this PR, the artifacts creation that I am optimizing is the creation of coreclr and libraries binaries. During the coreclr/libraries build step, it will see if we have already built the binaries and if yes, it will simply download it from Azure storage and upload it as pipeline artifacts. All the steps related to installing pre-requisite tools, product build, zipping, etc. will be skipped. This is possible using `Cache@2` task of AzDo.

## Scenarios

In this PR, the support of pipeline-caching is added to all the pipelines (internal and public) that consumes `coreclr/templates/build-job.yml` and `libraries/build-job.yml` files and if triggered `Manually` or through a `PullRequest`. To take an example, if a developer submits a PullRequest that just touches `libraries` folder. During the first execution of `runtime` pipeline on the PR branch, the `build-job.yml` would build required coreclr/libraries builds. If the developer further pushes more changes and if between the initial and subsequent changes, if there were no additional changes done in `coreclr` folder on `main` branch (see more details below), the caching will restore the previously cached CoreCLR binaries without needing to build them again. It will also upload the required artifacts, just as it happens today. Since there are at least 10~30 different configuration of `coreclr` builds we do, if the cache is ""hit"", we could save approximately 30 * 15 mins = 450 minutes of machine execution time on the subsequent run once this feature is enabled. As of today, the cache key is only matched per PR-branch. In other words, if there is a PR# AAA that touched `libraries` folder and we built and cached the artifacts that were produced out of it. Next there is another PR# BBB that is sent out and it too just touched `libraries` folder, and between `AAA` and `BBB` there were no `coreclr` commits in `main`, PR #BBB will still not be able to use cached contents. I have opened an https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/15589 to check why. The documentation clearly says that such scenarios are allowed, and cache can be used across branches within the same pipeline. However, if there were further updates to PR `AAA`, the cached contents can be used.

To summarize, in the best case, for a single additional push to a PR branch, pipeline caching can save up to 450 minutes of machine time. The worst case, when there are too many frequent changes in `coreclr` and `libraries`, the cache-key will never match and we will end up building the product, the way we do today except that we will continue to cache them in the hope that some run will use it. The step that caches the contents takes approximately 20 seconds and hence should not regress the current workflow.

## Cache Key

`Cache@2` needs a cache-key that should be unique for that particular run. Azdo creates a fingerprint of the cache-key and uses it to search for the cached contents. One portion of the cache-key should contain the build specific information like OS name, Architecture, BuildType (Debug, Checked or Release), framework name, etc. However, we also need a unique identifier to confirm if there were any changes in folders/files that would help us decide if a build is needed or not. The way I approached it is by checking the git-hashes of the paths we are interested in. [get_commit_hash](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/62464/files#diff-e60af28e3f16bb69b02b4c0017f9bd4b7abfdd0a50416e1848858d4a59c886faR41) is the python script that I would trigger to fetch the git-hashes of the paths that are interested for that particular build. For examples, if building `coreclr`, I would check the git commit hashes of `src/coreclr` and `src/native` folder. All the git commit hashes along with the build configuration (OS, architecture, etc.) is saved in a commit.txt file. I then use the contents of this file as the cache key that AzDo will use to check if it is a ""cache hit"" or a ""cache miss"".

Before we run the pipeline, we always merge the latest `main` in the PR branch. In such cases, if files inside `coreclr` is touched, we will always find a unique *merge* hash commit for `coreclr` folder and hence mismatch the previous cache key. This will guarantee that we build `coreclr` if there are any changes in that folder. On the contrary, we just fetch 40 commit's history during checkout. I added code to fetch little more history so we can correctly see the last commit that changed a folder/file. But sometimes, that might not be enough, and the files/folders might have changed prior to the history we have on AzDo machine. In such case, I will make an entry of `grafted` next to the file path. [Here](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=1503794&view=logs&j=54cabf5c-1ba4-54c9-31cb-a3ef0d378039&t=43aed140-0b0f-5596-36b8-b27458d6e610) are sample logs from [get_commit_hash file](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/62464/files#diff-e60af28e3f16bb69b02b4c0017f9bd4b7abfdd0a50416e1848858d4a59c886fa).

## Design

As mentioned previously, the `UsePipeline` variable is set to true only if the run is triggered from a PullRequest or Manually. It will be used to determine if `Cache@2` needs to be executed. There are other variables like `BUILD_CACHE_RESTORED`, BUILD_LOGS_RESTORED`, etc. that are set if the cache is restored. The values of these variables are then used to determine whether we should perform a particular step or should skip it.

There are few templates where the checks for `BUILD_CACHE_RESTORED` was needed and there is not a reliable way to add this in condition. Hence, I had to add their check explicitly in those yml files.

## Lookouts

Reviewers, please make sure if the paths I have listed in [get_commit_hash](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/62464/files#diff-e60af28e3f16bb69b02b4c0017f9bd4b7abfdd0a50416e1848858d4a59c886faR41) are correct and if more paths need to be added in the given categories.

## Next

I have a kustos query to understand if we are hitting ""Cache Hit"" or not. So in future, if we think that we almost never hit cache, we can look back and see how to improve things. Overall, if this is successful, it will also prove beneficial to cache building coreclr/libraries test because they are changed less frequently and hence will certainly be restored from the cache.

## Risk

It could happen that due to a bug, we might restore the cache that contains wrong or incorrect build artifacts. To work around, a developer can always make changes to one of the paths listed under `common` category and in such cases, the cache will always guarantee to see a cache miss. I have also opened https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/15583 to track some other issues in this feature.

In https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/68085, I relaxed the heuristics under which we would use SIMD registers for copy block unroll code. The code generated uses temporary registers to addresses to copy (could be GC references) and they are not reported. As such, we should mark the unroll code region as GC non-interruptible to make sure GC doesn't kick in and collect the wrong objects.

Note: We were marking `gtBlkOpGcUnsafe` only for situation where destination address was local, but never checked about the source address. This PR expands it to situation when either src/dst addresses are non-local (on heap).

Technically we should fix the doc - maybe it is the wrong index as I see a `1`. Maybe we renamed a param and did not update the xml files?
"> Is that really a problem, though? The prerendering system never starts emitting any response until the initial async render is completed. So the only way that the response has started is if it's for an unrelated reason, so it's no different from someone trying to do a redirection in MVC after they've already started flushing out output - the rules for that are well understood. As such it doesn't look to me like this would be unreliable at all.

Yeah, but this needs to work well with MVC and I'm pretty sure we've discouraged people in the past from doing a redirect within a View. Even if you succeed in the redirect, a lot of things can go wrong in the server and it's just walking into unknown territory.

It's not simply about performing the redirect, but about what happens on the server. How do you stop rendering, do you throw? If so you start polluting your logs with exceptions that are surreptitiously used to do flow control.

IMO we need to think about this in detail, so for now I want to just throw until we tackle it in a holistic way."
"Because when you run tests and do things like shadow-copying (like in tests), the location points to the wrong place. This is what MVC does to find related assemblies as part of application parts, and it has been improved a couple of times based on user feedback."
"The scenario that caused it was that my tests new-up an Application object then operate on that, so when I for example do two adds it's operating on the same object, so it tries to Load the project twice. Obviously that's not a ""real"" scenario, but it's the simplest way to test things, and it hardens us against having trouble if some future refactor should end up having use run LoadProject in two different places within one command, plus to my knowledge there's nothing ""wrong"" about it."
"> I think we need to at least check on the RemoteRenderer before we call ProcessPendingRender during OnRenderCompleted

Great point. Yes. I'm adding a check for that.

> Should we log something here and no-op instead?

Since we have no reason to believe it's at possible to make this happen through normal coding patterns, I'd be more interested in having a way of getting alerted if we're wrong and it does somehow happen.

If we can articulate definite scenarios where we want to support this I'm totally open to changing this though!

> I think no-oping is safer as there might be legitimate scenarios where something got queued into the sync context and the context got disposed before it got a chance to execute (as things get serialized).

Do you have specific scenarios in mind? The scenarios I'm aware of when renders are started are:

 * If a component asks to be rendered - this already no-opped if the renderer (or component) was already disposed.
 * When adding a new root component. If the renderer was already disposed, I think it's good to throw, since it's so bizarre to be adding a new root component then. For normal server-side Blazor, the registered root component(s) will be added immediately during host creation, so definitely before disposal.
 * When resuming the queue processing after an ACK, which will now be no-opped by the updated logic here.
"
"I don't think this is working. Looking at the public CI artifacts (which perhaps are wrong) I see: `3.1.1-ci`. That indicates two things to me:

1. The `.1` patch version is applied. We want these to be `3.1.0`.
1. The `-preview1` label is being lost, though again, perhaps that's a problem in the public CI.

@github/aspnet-build do you have context on this? The same problem likely applies to the other two PRs (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/17041, https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/2618)"

"@github I didn't realise there were any issues *building* the E2ETests project. That sounds serious and we would want to know if that goes wrong. I don't think we should be suppressing that kind of problem (e.g., maybe it reflects some actual SDK issue)."
"@github i highly suspect your'e right.  This is why i proposed the above:

> Note: a better approach might be to have this data just passed through the API instead of trying to re-establish it at this point in the code. It might make it clearer at which point the info is getting 'out of sync' as it were...

It's pretty clear to me that this code is trying to synthesize a relation that doesn't seem to exist.  So, it would likely be better if the entire codepath was explicit about passing this data along, and then had explicit code to try to decide what to do if/when the data didn't meet its expectation.  i.e. if the buffer we have for ""newTreeTags"" doesn't match teh one for ""oldTreeTags"", we really need to have explicit code to understand what that means, and what to do about it.

Note: this is also pretty scary to me given that taggers are supposed to be either view or buffer associated.  If we're breaking that assumption... then we need to do some pretty substantial rethinking of things.  

As an alternative, we could try to figure out why we're getting a tagger that isn't really associated with a single buffer, and we could try to change things to make it so that we have that invariant.  i.e. instead of reusing this tagger across buffer, ensure we have a unique tagger per buffer.  That way we coudl then put in invariant-checks in the code that we weren't operating on the wrong buffer."

"@github I think there is a weird cycle now between `editorGroupView#layout` and `tabsTitleControl#layout`: 
* first we ask the tabs title control for the height using `offsetHeight` which can trigger a full browser layout btw
* then we ask to layout the tabs title control
* this potentially results in the title control to change its height depending on the logic inside
* but we still use the previous computed height for the editor
* we may end up using the wrong height for the editor

I think conceptually it should be:
* `editorGroupView#layout` which will trigger...
* ...title control layout which returns its height that it ended up using
* then editor control layout with that height

With this algorithm I would also think that you do not need to know the editor height, you can simply pass the overall height into the title control layout and then decide from within if the title should wrap or not.

Does that make sense?

As for the additional challenge that a `redraw` of tabs can result in the title height changing: I think this should not trigger a `relayout`, rather I would think that the tabs title control should have an event that is fired whenever the height changes and the editor group can register on that to trigger `redraw`. I think that would also help for the current logic that triggers `redraw` when breadcrumbs are enabled or disabled.

**PS:** I think it would be good if the CSS changes in tabsTitleControl.css could get some comments, I am having a hard time understanding the need for the properties, as well as the `important` and it would help for future maintenance if the logic is explained via comments."

"...now that we're digging into this, an obvious question is this: *Why does anybody care?*

Additionally, the description is wrong.

(Also, let's stop using ""Android Callable Wrapper"" and stick with ""Java Callable Wrapper"". ;-)

Consider a variation on the previous [repro instructions](
https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2258/files#r222784089): two assemblies which both declare the ""same"" C# type:

```csharp
namespace Lib1
{
  public class EmptyClass : Java.Lang.Object
  {
  }
}
```

We thus have two different `Lib1.EmptyClass` types running around.  However, because there is no `[Register]`, then we hit the default ""md5-ify everything"" approach, which means we *can* emit two separate Java Callable Wrapper types: `md56bf89f81d87b2a3b578f763649ead9ef.EmptyClass` for `Lib1.EmptyClass, Lib1` and `md551eaf02b2ef90dc8aacda5445b93be5c.EmptyClass` for `Lib1.EmptyClass, Lib2`.

We *can* -- *do* -- generate Java Callable Wrappers for *both* types.

Thus, why care that we have two separate ""Lib1.EmptyClass"" types running around?  What's the *actual* problem?

The actual problem comes in places where an assembly cannot be specified, such as within `.axml` files.  There, if we used `<Lib1.EmptyClass/>`, there is no way to say ""use the `EmptyClass` type from Lib1"" vs. ""use the `EmptyClass` type from Lib2"".  It's ambiguous.

However, *fragments* allow avoiding this, e.g. by using `<fragment type=""Lib1.EmptyClass, Lib1"" />`.  (No idea if anyone actually uses that functionality, but it exists.)  Again, though, if you use `<fragment type=""Lib1.EmptyClass"" />` -- no assembly -- then *one* of the types is picked.  The first one.

What is the fix?  Change the type names so that they have different C# Namespace.Type names.  The documentation should likewise mention how to fix the warning."

I actually think your code comments are good, they’re just hard to find because they’re two whole files away from the formatter. You wouldn’t really know in `formatting.ts` or `formattingScanner.ts` that you were going to create “synthesized” tokens, so to speak, unless you actually went into the scanner itself. This is part of the reason why I do think it’s worthwhile to at least investigate moving that logic out of the scanner."

The issue is that `mono_type_is_reference` does not look at whether a generic parameter has a constraint that would make it a reference type (there is a big comment near `mono_type_is_reference` that making it do so would break generic
sharing).

The issue is if you have something like:

```

class BaseClass {}

public class C {
       public virtual BaseClass SomeCovariantFunction() => ...
}

public class G<T> : C where T : BaseClass {
       public override T SomeCovariantFunction() => ...
}
```

Here when setting up `G<T>` we do a check that the override of `SomeCovariantFunction` that returns T is a valid, which boils down to checking that `T` is ok for a covariant return from `BaseClass`.  This is mostly the same as `BaseClass` is-assignable-from `T`, except we also need to check that `T` is not a valuetype that implements interface `BaseClass`.  That check was wrong.  The fix is to check for `is_valuetype`, not `!is_reference` on `T`.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/58326

Backport of #58392 to release/6.0

/cc @github

## Customer Impact

Without this fix, users of `TimeZoneInfo.HasIanaId` can get wrong values when using `TimeZoneInfo.Local`.

We have exposed the new property `TimeZoneInfo.HasIanaId` in .NET 6.0. This property tells if the Time Zone object is created with IANA Id. This property returns the correct results except when using `TimeZoneInfo.Local`. The reason is when we initialize `TimeZoneInfo.Local` property we clone the object before returning it, but we missed cloning `HasIanaId` property inside the returned object. The fix is to ensure `HasIanaId` is initialized correctly in `TimeZoneInfo.Local`.

## Testing

I tested this on Windows and Linux. Also, I have run the whole regression tests with the fix without any problem. I added more tests to cover the test gap for the functionality we are fixing here.

## Risk

Is low. The fix is scoped to the `HasIanaId` property only which is a newly exposed property in .NET 6.0. The change is well tested and added more tests too.

"Talked offline. We might do this in a subsequent PR, but the kind of stuff I was trying initially where `Mvc.ModelBinding.IBindingSourceMetadata` implements `Http.Metadata.IBindingSourceMetadata` was pretty ugly.

Now this doesn't even compile (C# doesn't like interfaces having members with the same name even if explicitly implemented), but you can see the ugliness of having two very similar interfaces.

There are 6 `IFrom*Metadata` attributes so far. I don't think that's too crazy. I do like that the eventual extensibility would be just to create a new interface rather than a second-class `Custom` or `Other` BindingSource."

}

// Kernel can call executeCommand('executeCell', { cell }); to trigger an execution
```

Peng and I discussed this. It's more in a direction similar to what we have today but keeps the execution object concept. Essentially the execution object would only be created by vscode and passed via the executeCells API, and if a kernel needs to trigger an execution, it would call some API or use executeCommand to do that, and vscode would call `executeCells` shortly after.

Pros are that it would give more of a ""single direction"" of data flow between vscode and the kernel. The run button clicking case and the kernel-initiated execution case would work exactly the same way. The executeCells API really feels like it should return a promise that actually follows the lifetime of the execution process, and this enables that.

Cons are that this inverses the relationship between vscode and the kernel. If the kernel really is the source of truth about whether a cell is executing, then it's wrong to have an API model where the kernel has to request that vscode start executing a cell. Really it has to be vscode that requests that the kernel start an execution, and the kernel telling vscode that it is executing. Tbh I'm having trouble telling whether this is just a philosophical problem or a real one. But I think that this solution has to lead to vscode being the one to maintain the execution state of a cell, rather than the kernel.

Also the shape above is not correct, we would need to figure out how to pass N execution objects for cells in the range, which is weird, or change the API to execute a single cell, which is also weird."

"Note that what I said above is a strict correctness requirement on morphing functions: they must not delete nodes under CSE (technically they must not delete active CSE candidates, but for simplicity and robustness it is preferred to simply not run folding under CSE), they must preserve VNs, not doing so can (and has) lead to hard to diagnose silent bad codegen bugs and/or crashes. Note that I think it will be hard to reproduce something going wrong here (perhaps with aggressive CSE for constants...), I would not recommend spending much time on finding a reproduction.

There is a possible exception to the ""must preserve VNs"" rule in that it should be ""fine"" to create new nodes with `NoVN`, but we shy away from doing so for simplicity purposes (it is easier to reason about - ""Does morph preserve VNs?"" -- ""Yes, always"", instead of ""Well, sort of kind of"")."

"> Seems like we have an issue in TieredCompilation in the call count logic. Since we are doing a reverse P/Invoke it is possible the thread doesn't exist.

Is this an issue that would exist before this change or only after this change?

My first thought is that the reverse-pinvoke transition would be the best place to create the thread object. Would that be possible? I'm not aware if that is something that is being tried to be avoided.

If this is expected after this change, I'm curious about other potential issues with the thread object not existing.

> I think that (2) is probably the right thing to do since the call is going to have to create a thread anyways.

Where would the thread object be created?

If it's reaching this path without a thread object available, it can also reach jitted code of the method without the thread object being available. I'm not sure if there would be other issues with that. Just an example, how would the following not be possible:
- The native-callable method is already jitted (on a different thread)
- The native code calls the method from the new thread after it has already been jitted, which would typically go to the jitted code without going through the prestub
- The managed native-callable method calls a virtual method that ends up in `VSD_ResolveWorker`, which may have similar issues with not having the thread object available - not entirely sure

I don't know if it is currently safe to call managed code on a thread without a thread object, perhaps others would know. From briefly looking at the relevant code, it almost seems like a thread object is necessary to transition between preemptive and cooperative GC modes, though that's just a far estimation and I could be wrong about that."

"Hey @github, something went wrong when looking for the build artifact. ([You can check the log here](https://typescript.visualstudio.com/TypeScript/_build/index?buildId=79103&_a=summary))."
"Took a step back and dug a little deeper to understand why the repro posted by Ryan [here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/44572#issuecomment-860786816) works when the `B` type parameter is deleted--which is really odd.

I now understand what the real problem is.

We have logic in `structuredTypeRelatedTo` that skips over variance checks for type alias instantiations and type references that contain marker types in their type arguments. The intent is to force structural comparisons during variance computations. However, the logic only skips for _certain_ instantiations involving marker types, namely those where one type argument is a marker type and the remaining type arguments are just the type parameters themselves. That means we _don't_ skip over variance checking for a type instantiation like `Child<?, unknown>` (where `?` is a marker type), and that's the kind of instantiation we get in the example because of the defaulted type argument for `B`. So, we start reporting `Ternary.Unknown` results where really we should be doing structural comparisons.

Changing our logic to skip variance checking for any type instantiation where at least one type argument is a marker type fixes the issue. It causes us to do a bit more structural comparing when computing variances, but obviously it was wrong not to do this extra work. I think this is the solution we want to go with. I will put up a new PR and we'll see what the performance impact is, if any."

Hi @github - yes, but I think this is a somewhat known issue for certain environments. In fact, I just had to update docs to mention details about this per @github, see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/51866#issuecomment-826936347. 

I'm not certain that this is isolated to Ubuntu 16.04, but that is the only environment that I saw occasionally failing for this test unit test. I believed it to be related to the `FileSystemWatcher` not reliably signaling that the file has changed. I also found an old [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31236514/2410379) that mentioned concerns with Ubuntu and the `FileSystemWatcher` not signaling.

I used the wrong register in the VM stub implementation for this function.
In addition, some changes are necessary for VSD calls through dispatcher
(that we cannot do on x64).

Fix #65111

Also remove macOS from the jit-cfg job. jit-cfg includes a GCStress
scenario which is not supported on macOS x64. Rather than
excluding it just there, just exclude all of macOS since CFG is a
Windows only feature anyway.

I am still keeping the Linux-x64/Linux-arm64 jobs as we produce
different IR for arguments on these ABIs and I want to keep the CFG
handling working in general for all the forms of IR we can produce
related to calls.

"I don't understand, we were in the same meeting where we decided that's not a good idea without giving a consumer of IBufferWriter a way to notify other components that memory is preserved.


Even with pipe implementation holding onto Memory is safe only until flush is called which is often not controlled by IBufferWriter consumer. Like in the following sample:

``` C#
var writer = new SomeLenghtPrefixSerializer(response.BodyPipe);
foreach (var o in objects)
{
   writer.WriteObject(o);
   // Is this safe to do or is writer still holding onto memory?
   await response.BodyPipe.FlushAsync();
}
```

Getting this kind of assumption wrong can lead to severe consequences - considering that we reuse blocks response intended for one client can be sent to another one.

Another reason is that IBufferWriter implementation can be transforming bytes synchronously (encryption/compression) after they were advanced. "

If it really is something wrong in the user code or environment, we can usually figure that out by asking for a simplified repro (and not getting one).

Update: I remembered wrong and the speclet is out-of-date. Names do matter (LDM 7/15/2016, per https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/12689).  #Resolved"
"Added assert.

@github I've went and cleaned up most of the allocations I could find on this path when I saw it come up while typing.

Maybe there's something wrong in the VSMac host, WRT checksums, but I've done validation recently and they seem okay."
"is there something wrong with the formatting in here? It seems fine..

Perhaps it wants the `{` on the same indent level as the `var`?"
😕 wrong commit?
What's wrong here? #Resolved
"That's certainly what I wrote.

Really it's that

* All the parameters types show the fields as nullable, because they're also input types.
* When exported, the public fields aren't null
* This helper therefore never sees null
* But it takes many `!`s to express that.

If extended to the full ""compare this parameters struct to that one"", null and empty are different (though empty is ""wrong""), so I went with this behavior."
"dumb question.  why is this here, instead of inside `._protocol.GoToDefinitionAsync` when it needs to call out to 3rd parties?"
"> I'd say taking dependency on that behavior was wrong

Valuing back-compat means I won't second-guess whether dependencies on our current behavior are wise, reasonable, or intentional. I only care how likely it is that the dependencies exist and weigh the harm it would cause customers to have their working app break vs. the value the change brings.

> Let's make it consistent and predictable

These aren't the attributes I value much when modifying existing shipping code. If there are specific scenarios that customers are likely to hit and making this change will benefit them then that could be compelling. Otherwise I am quite content sticking with the devil I know : )"
"I would consider it wrong. Having both encodings be non-null means we've produced an `EmitOptions` that can't really be represented on the command line. Further it complicates the logic to know ""was a fallback enocding used?"" When looking at a `Compilation` you can just do a `null` check but when looking at `EmitOptions` the same `null` check for the same named property is not sufficient. "
The previous logic was wrong here too but EnableDebugging is more like DebugLevel and is and integer.  The integer value should be passed to the call.
"Test is wrong now. I originally was throwing from everyhting that was in-memory before I figured out we actually doc'd the behavior. I need to write a new test using single-file, but don't know where to write the test"
"@github thanks for finding that, I can confirm it looks suspicious. I have opened https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/108607 to look into it. This will also require that `preload` scripts get access to the configuration, or a subset. Once I have tackled that problem, we should revisit this PR too.

> Just reiterating so we are on the same page, the problem that this tries to fix is that VS Code is trying to check the wrong environment for VSCODE_CLI and VSCODE_FORCE_USER_ENV. 

Understood. One impact your change has is that we will now always resolve the shell environment on startup, even if you start from the command line. This may have a bad impact on startup perf because we need to spawn another process. A more elegant solution imho would be to really only trigger this dance for the first window that needs it. But I cannot really see a good solution for this at the moment given we resolve the shell environment once and then store the promise.

"I'm _mildly_ worried about putting the emoji in the file as literals like this - I know in the past we've had issues where someone's text editor saves a file with emoji as the wrong encoding which then end up breaking the tests later. I could be mistaken though, I'll let @github or @github refresh my memory if this is a bad idea or not."
"Instead of defining `_errorFormat` as a global constant it's probably easier to understand if you write:
```cpp

"~~Not easily. It would require a significant refactoring of construction.~~ I misread this as returning an actual thing, not `null`. It would be possible, but whether it's the right thing to do, I'd need to think on a bit.

I would immediately gravitate toward regex, but some people hate that.

I don't think I'd be that critical, personally. But someone else might care more than me.

It could even change straight up into `TfEditSession.cpp`. That's fine with me.

Eh, that's OK.

❔ Was this changed as part of the wrong commit?
"I just saw this change... I think it's faulty. It's also going to be more-wrong in any application that is configured to use Solarized via the ANSI/terminal codes, as the [Solarized Dark background `base03` is canonically _brblack_, index 8](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/#the-values).

I'd suggest, if you want to go this way, to adopt the [cmd-colours variation of Solarized](https://github.com/shanselman/cmd-colors-solarized), which swaps _all_ the bright/non-bright attributes. Using it requires modifying colour mappings for 16-colour Solarized themes, but at least it's a consistent swap rather than individual replacement, and already a known quantity for people coming from Conhost-based Solarized setups.

(Side-note: I was confused because this commit appears in the list of [commits to master _since_ 1.2.2022.0 was tagged](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/compare/v1.2.2022.0...master), linked from [the release](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.2.2022.0). Is the git tag incorrect compared to the release?)

The gain is that `$ESC[48;5;0m` is now the same as `$ESC[40m`, i.e. hiding #293. The loss is that `$ESC[48;5;0m` and `$ESC[48;5;8m` (and hence `$ESC[40m` and `$ESC[100m` are reversed which means your dark background has the wrong brightness relationship to your dark foreground.

Why were you testing with `#073642` (`base02`) on `#002b36` (`base03`) BTW? Those are both background colours in Solarized, so you should never actually see that combination. If this is the problem we're trying to solve, then indeed just punting Solarized from the codebase is probably the best option, since it always requires further configuration than just switching a colour palette.

The same reason. We visit the stack in execution order (bottom to top, as mentioned in comments) and I wanted to make sure to not hoist children past its parents, if parents have side-effects. Let me know if you can think of a better way to validate this.

Pooling has costs. Extra code to avoid allocation needs to be loaded and JIT'd and has costs (beyond complexity and maintenance costs).

I believe the better solution is, if the base class only has a `get`ter (thus the base class property is `readonly`), then there should be an error in that particular case. Otherwise, there should be no error. (Additionally, the subclass should have the opportunity to make the property not readonly by defining a new accessor).

Blocking normal JavaScript behavior is against TypeScript's design goals, and this change does not improve static type checking for end users: it limits type checking, rather than expanding it in a useful way.

"@github do not get me wrong it is a good thing but microsoft will not merge it we would need to maintain a vscode fork for that and i am not joking i am fighting with them since 5+ years.

Your Solution is better then nothing. And it is more then i got done till today :) So i already cherry picked it internal.

but we need to make it more easy useable as sayed overall the path forward is to create or fork the deprecated language-server project then integrate for example this typescript version and create a installer for that so that existing vscode users can simple install this as additional language server
then we could start to solve the problem complet via refactoring this indipendent."
"Thanks for the much detailed feedback! It was very helpful.
1. As you've mentioned, I've modified the code so the autocompletion are also given to the `unknown`, `object`, `{}`,  `Record<string, any>` , *an object having String index type*, `<T extends object>`, `<T extends {}>`.

2. > More practically, it’s going to be too expensive to check the assignability of every identifier in the completions list, so I think the choice is between offering all the completions, even wrong ones, or none.

IMHO, offering all the completions would be better even if some of are wrong. The difference between the contextual type case is that dot can't be followed in shorthand completion so there's no chance that ending up with different type. Even though, as you mentioned, since checking all the assignability of the list is expensive, just offering them all rather than nothing could give more good user experience, I think.

3. If those types are good to go, I think types with `Object` and `Object | { a: string}`(Union type including empty object type) could be also good to go. In addition, the code below has no error with using `foo` inside of the object literal so it seems reasonable to suggest auto completion.
```ts
declare const foo: number;
interface Empty {}
interface Typed { typed: number; }

declare function f10<T extends Object>(obj: T): void;
declare function f13<T extends (Empty | Object | Typed)>(obj: T): void;

f10({foo});
f13({foo});
```

Please give a thoughts about this suggestion!

4. While I'm implementing this, I needed to check if the object is empty object type(ex: `{}`) or not.
Since it seems that there's no such function in `completions.ts`, I made some extra exports from `checker.ts` to use in `completions.ts` which are,
- `isTypeSubsetOf()`
- `isEmptyObjectType()`
- `globalObjectType` (`@github getGlobalObjectType()`)

I'm not sure if it is legal to do this only for my intention.
Please give an advice whether it is okay anyway? (also, looks like **typescript-bot** is complaining about the *lib update* and what can I do this for it :o)

"I haven't looked at the pr yet. However my general concern is around how a particular piece of coffee knows which overload to use, and if there are problems if they use the wrong one. 

For example:

> In code style layer the method also takes ISyntaxFormatting or ISimplification instance, 

What if you're not in the codestyle layer?  Can you still use these? Should you?  Would it be bug if you used the wrong one?"
"> please note the signatures of AtomicComposition.TryGetValue<T>() were updated to [NotNullWhen(true)] out T? value rather than [MaybeNullWhen(false)] out T value

But that's not a valid change, is it?  null values are valid, and the caller could specify a nullable T, in which case the annotation is wrong: TryGetValue could successfully return true and give back value == null.  In general that's why we use `[MaybeNullWhen(false)]` on generic outs from TryGetValue.  What makes this one special?"
"That makes me more confident that this won't break TS programs. Still, I thought JS functions didn't use contextual typing to find a type from `@github`. Am I wrong?
If functions don't use contextual typing, then methods should use a mechanism similar to the one functions use."
"> Couldn't you go with predictable and safe behavior (although slow)

We considered it and we don't think it's feasible. An unknown number of code bases out there would be negatively impacted, in some cases quite dramatically. To wit, compilation of `immutable.js` slowed down 50x with the candidate PR. It's an awful experience when updating to the latest version of TypeScript all of a sudden hangs your build process. I'd love to do better, but for the moment we don't have other candidate solutions.

Also, it really is relatively rare that the current implementation gets variance measurement wrong. It requires types to be circularly dependent _and_ to flip variance somewhere in the circularity. That happens, but it definitely isn't common.

> I'm worried that by accepting the random behavior now the community will get stuck with it forever

The scenarios in which the issue occurs are rare and well understood, and we'll continue to think about ways in which we can improve accuracy of variance measurement without adversely affecting performance. Nothing prevents us from adopting a better algorithm in the future.

> It should be “contravariant”

Indeed. Thanks for catching that, I have fixed it.

> how measuring is different from what u check and for what u raise errors described in the thread?

Variance measurement is similar to variance annotation checking, but requires more checks. Specifically, we always perform at least two checks (subtype-to-supertype and supertype-to-subtype) to measure variance, and sometimes require a third check to distinguish bivariance from unwitnessed type parameters. In contrast, annotation checking requires only one check for co- or contravariance, and no check at all for invariance."
"@github `System.Linq` dependency was not a problem, as only `.ToArray()` was being used and I was able to reference `EnumerableHelpers` to get it working. It turned out that we also have a dependency to `Queue<T>` and `Stack<T>` which I had to move as well. Is that acceptable?

"@github Thanks for linking the issue and providing more information.

In my opinion, if the API provides method with cancellation token it should be possible to use at
any time. That for a cancellation token is! And also passed timeout treated well and works as
expected in the `NamedPipeClientStream`.

The async-over-sync pattern is implemented by dividing wait time into small pieces to be able check
the passed cancellation token. I think the problem of that PR not in the design domain but just a
regular bug where timeout handled wrong."
They were made to debug any JsonTypeInfo/JsonPropertyInfo issues. There are still couple of other flaky issues other than the one mentioned - I'm not yet sure if that will be useful for debugging those or not. Also this is super useful when making changes and something goes wrong or gets regressed (I had to explore these information many times under debugger when doing prototyping for contract resolver and that actually makes it much easier to extract). I'll leave this for now and we can clean it up once we are confident our tests are not blocking CI runs
I was logging the wrong thing here. `e` is `XUnitAssertException`
I think I'm wrong. What this overload should do is to see if Uri is SAS uri and if not use DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.
"I believe properties that can be deserialized from JSON must have public setters - correct me if I'm wrong on this. If that's the case, we probably don't need users to be able to tinker with the various properties, hence the internal `FileListEntry` and the public `IFileListEntry` that describes those properties as read-only."
"My guess is that your reasoning is that the value *might* in fact be `null`, because JS might return null/undefined, and then STJ will give you `null` at runtime. However that's no more true when calling JS code than it is when calling .NET code (which might have not-null annotation but then actually returns null at runtime).

The best .NET-only analogy for JS interop would be a developer making calls to their own code (because both the .NET and JS parts are typically the developer's own code). When calling your own code, you get to choose what the nullability annotation says on the called-code side, and it's up to you the developer to get that right. If you're wrong, and you say something returns nonnull but it actually returns null at runtime, then you'll get a NRE when dereferencing but that's fine because you shouldn't get it wrong. In this case because the called-code is JS you can't put the nullability annotation there, so you have to put it in the generic parameter to `InvokeAsync` instead. Why shouldn't you be free to specify whatever nullability you want there? If the value might be null, say so, and if not, say not.

The only case I could make for treating .NET specially is that JS return values are more untrusted than .NET return values. If there are reasonable security reasons for needing to check for null return values then I would agree it's helpful to make the compiler guide people to do that. However I can't really think of cases where it would be *more* problematic to get a NRE during dereferencing compared with throwing another exception preemptively due to a null check."
"> Is there a chance that it could be related to this?

Yup. We were probably compiling against the wrong reference assemblies.

"Not saying this is wrong, but how does this work? So if an exception is thrown, either this runs immediately before catch blocks or not. If it does, then it'll recurse no matter what. If it doesn't...there's basically special magic involved? Then it's not recursive?"
"> If we are concerned about this, can we detect this on the server and throw an exception before we even start sending data? It's not something we care about in general.

Updated accordingly. 

I'd still like to keep the client provided `error` to the `ReceiveJSDataChunk` in case of exceptionary circumstances (ex. something goes wrong with SignalR causing the client to error out). By having the client send the error, the server can proceed to close the pipe and dispose the stream. Let me know if you have concerns with this approach."
"@github in this branch, we're just doing the bare minimum to test the ref readonly feature on the new version. @github's work (he can correct me if I'm wrong) will handle the versioning story, with all the side items required (project system/IDE), and it will eventually be merged into this branch, overwriting the tiny fixes here."

Yep, gotta wait until branches are open. The issue isn't what kind of changes go in, it's the fact that new commits trigger new builds which publish new things with the old branding (and, if we aren't careful or the timing is wrong, new builds trigger dependency flow, which compounds the problem)."

"Which is all to suggest that maybe a ""`clang` version check"" is the wrong course of action here, and perhaps instead check for a *file* within the SDK which suggests that arm64 is supported?

Swift documentation appears to be per-ABI, resulting in files such as:

```
/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk/System/iOSSupport/usr/lib/swift/CoreNFC.swiftmodule/arm64.swiftdoc
```

Xcode 11 has a `CoreNFC.swiftmodule/x86_64.swiftdoc`, but no `arm64.swiftdoc` file.

Alternatively, the `SDKSettings.json` file mentions it:

```
/* /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk//SDKSettings.json */
…
""DeploymentTargetSettingName"":""MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"",""Archs"":[""x86_64"",""x86_64h"",""arm64""]
…
```

It's all one line, but the Xcode 11 `SDKSettings.json` file doesn't contain *any* mention of arm64`, meaning `grep` may be sufficient:

```
$ grep arm64 /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk//SDKSettings.json 2>&1 > /dev/null && echo yes

"VS can discover the test, but can't run it, local dotnet test can't discover it. What's wrong?"
"I'm currently assuming that I didn't test the Java.Interop commits I thought I was testing.

Or, insanity.

In particular, consider: https://github.com/xamarin/java.interop/blob/bc5bcf4f0ef07aab898f2643d2a25f66512d98ed/src/Java.Interop/Java.Interop/JniRuntime.JniMarshalMemberBuilder.cs#L30-L36

This is the `JniRuntime.SetMarshalMemberBuilder()` method:

```csharp
		[System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage (""Design"", ""CA1031:Do not catch general exception types"", Justification = ""the *.Export assemblies are optional, so we don't care when they cannot be loaded (they are presumably missing)"")]
#if NET
		[DynamicDependency (DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicParameterlessConstructor, ""Java.Interop.MarshalMemberBuilder"", ""Java.Interop.Export"")]
		[UnconditionalSuppressMessage (""Trimming"", ""IL2026"", Justification = ""DynamicDependency should preserve the constructor."")]
		[UnconditionalSuppressMessage (""Trimming"", ""IL2035"", Justification = ""Java.Interop.Export.dll is not always present."")]
#endif
		partial void SetMarshalMemberBuilder (CreationOptions options)
```

Note in particular that it has custom attributes wrapped in `NET`.

Also note that my fix for `JavaTypeParametersAttribute` was to likewise wrap it in `#if NET`: https://github.com/xamarin/java.interop/pull/929/files#diff-fd9c9afe3c2714f79442afdb021394950e51b6791f835fc8f448e2b3e147e852R3

Thus, the only way `JavaTypeParametersAttribute` should exist is if `NET` is defined.  Yet if I disassemble the `Java.Interop.dll` that was packaged by the installer, *none* of the attributes are emitted.

(Which is differently odd, as `[SuppressMessage]` isn't present *either*!  It's apparently never emitted to IL.)

"While working on this bugfix, I realized that another bug exists:

    ""iterateOn"": ""profiles""
},
{

    ""commands"": [ { ""command"": ""newTab"" } ]
}
```

Here, the settings model exports these commands to the command palette as one entry in the name map (the iterable command). This is wrong though, because really the user is explicitly asking for a command named ""${profile.name}"".

**However**, this bug already exists in v1.8, but in a different manifestation.

Here's the encountered behaviors:
- this PR: iterable command wins
- `v1.8` & `main`: whichever command is added second wins (in the case above, nested command)
- expected: no conflict

This bugfix brings us closer to a world where this new bug is fixed. We would need to mess with how we expand commands. But (a) that's too risky for a hotfix and (b) this is a _really_ obscure bug.

"Had no original documents, so can't answer your question, but to correctly handle such things the month and year parts should be avoided, but they still can be received and it will be a valid input. The problem is that it's not compatible with .NET date and time representations.

For example, PostgreSQL has `interval` which stores a duration in three parts: months, days, microseconds. And to handle arithmetic operations properly it deconstructs a `timestamp` into parts, adds an interval to it and then assembles a new `timestamp` again. `timestamp` is a 64 bit integer measuring microseconds.

Unfortunately, `TimeSpan` stores ticks and can't be correctly constructed from any input. For that reason it lacks of `Years` and `Months` properties.

Therefore, while I agree with @github that it's a wrong logic and serialization should not include years and months, deserialization of `TimeSpan` will cause issues if these parts are present. Surely, I can just throw a `NotSupportedException` for such cases and it will solve the problem."

We should push for simple abstractions for this sort of thing that both isolate the complexity and make it very difficult for downstream clients to get things wrong.  This helps avoid whole classes of bugs, and it makes it possible to focus correctness on a single part of the system.

Since we're already working to eliminate the raceyness here, i'd much rather we just do it now instead of potentially missing something and having to deal with this same issue a month/year down the line.

"I think the real issue here is that optional properties cannot be checked in the face of unknown extensions. We allow assignment to a target with an optional property when the source doesn't have that property, but we only know that to be true when the source is not subject to further extension (i.e. when source type expresses ""the whole truth""). For that reason, we do have this same problem with type parameters. For example, X = A & T, where X is a type with an optional property p, A is a type that has no property p, and T is a type parameter. If T is instantiated to a type that has a property p with the wrong type, an inconsistency appears. In fact, the same inconsistency exists just with X = T. It all has to do with the way we check optional properties and I'm not sure we can do much about it.

@github You should include your handling of box_vt so I can see what is wrong. You are probably not updating the vtstack accordingly after removing instructions that push/pop it.
"I’ll describe what happens _before_ this change. This code errors because “No overload matches this call” on the `.filter(...)`:

```ts
interface Success {
    isSuccess: true;
}

interface Fail {
    isSuccess: false;
}

function bar<Q>(a: (Success | Fail)[]) {
    a
        .map(item => ({...item}))
        .filter(value => {
            return value.isSuccess;
        });
}
```

The error elaboration for the overload that ought to match is

```
Overload 2 of 2, '(predicate: (value: { isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; }, index: number, array: ({ isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; })[]) => unknown, thisArg?: any): ({ isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; })[]', gave the following error.
    Argument of type '(value: { isSuccess: true; }) => true' is not assignable to parameter of type '(value: { isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; }, index: number, array: ({ isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; })[]) => unknown'.
      Types of parameters 'value' and 'value' are incompatible.
        Type '{ isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; }' is not assignable to type '{ isSuccess: true; }'.
          Type '{ isSuccess: false; }' is not assignable to type '{ isSuccess: true; }'.
            Types of property 'isSuccess' are incompatible.
              Type 'false' is not assignable to type 'true'.
```

and quick info on `value` shows `{ isSuccess: true }` instead of the union, providing a clue as to what’s going wrong.

The first important thing that happens is the spread in the `.map(...)` call creates new type identities that are structurally identical to `Success` and `Fail` and `Success | Fail` (which is why printback no longer uses those names afterward), and both the new `{ isSuccess: true }` and the new `{ isSuccess: false }` types share their declaration site at `{ ...item }`.

Where the problem arises is during signature resolution for `.filter(...)`. We try on the first overload, which is

```ts
interface Array<T> {
  // ...
  filter<S extends T>(predicate: (value: T, index: number, array: T[]) => value is S, thisArg?: any): S[];
  // ...
}
```

and try to infer `S`. Since our predicate is not a type predicate, inference initially produces `unknown`, which we will need to replace with the constraint of `T`, which is `{ isSuccess: true } | { isSuccess: false }`. We first instantiate this constraint with the inference context’s non-fixing mapper, which ought to act as the identity function since this type does not reference `S`, but it goes off the rails.

We instantiate each union constituent through `getObjectTypeInstantiation` (we’ve finally made it to the code this PR changes). Recall that _each_ constituent’s symbol’s declaration is `{ ...item }`. We have an outer type parameter `Q`, which should have no effect on the instantiation in the end, but we don’t determine that without trying it. But first, we cache our union constituent `{ isSuccess: true }` as the result of the instantiation for `Q` on the node links for `{ ...item }` (this is the line I removed). When we move on to the second union constituent, `{ isSuccess: false }`, we have a problem: since the declaration is the same, we already have `links.outerTypeParameters` cached, so we move on to the real work of the function (`if (typeParameters.length) { ... }`). We get the `typeArguments` for this instantiation by running the outer type parameters (`Q`) through the inference context’s mapper. Because `Q` was not the inference target, it returns `Q`, so our type arguments are just `Q`. We look up the instantiation for `Q` on the links, and get the result from the previous union constituent, `{ isSuccess: true }`—clearly wrong.

So in short, the union `{ isSuccess: true } | { isSuccess: false }` collapses to the first constituent during an instantiation that should have been a no-op because the first one gets cached as the instantiation of an unused outer type parameter on their shared declaration."

This is not what I expected. But I could reproduce the `Safe handle has been closed` error with few hundred runs. 
With this change I did ~ 5000 runs without single failure. There may be more to it but this definitely seems to help.

I have some ideas why we do not see this more:

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/f3390fdb46ece449e15515a925a81aa535059f19/src/libraries/System.Net.Security/src/System/Net/Security/SslSessionsCache.cs#L196-L209

With this we would try to string the cache only on multiples of 32. With certificate, protocols and EncryptionPolicy that generally would be never on clients as there is typically no client certificate, few protocol variations and nobody sane should not use anything but `Encrypt` policy. 

So it tales some effort to even hit the reduction code - perhaps by crafting many unique certificates. 
For future investigations, lowering `CheckExpiredModulo` makes it much easier to test that code. 

While we lock on cache changes, we don't seems to when we retrieving cached value. 
And all the entries stored in the cache are disposed. 
And we seems to allocate a lot while attempting to shrink:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/f3390fdb46ece449e15515a925a81aa535059f19/src/libraries/System.Net.Security/src/System/Net/Security/SslSessionsCache.cs#L224-L225

So while the caching may be improved, I did not find anything particularly wrong. 
My current speculation is that the observed issue is caused by polluting cache with bad values. 
With the added extra check my local runs are now happy.

"> Can we hold off on merging this for a little bit?

Sure. What's wrong?"
"> [RouteTableFactory.cs(57,34)]

You raise a good point about the `[Parameter]` properties, plus I guess any other framework-invoked methods on the component types. I think that so far, this hasn't been an issue because the framework itself doesn't contain routable components, and application code isn't normally trimmed at all. It would only be an issue for RCLs that somebody marks as trimmable (rare).

If there is some way for the `[Route]` attribute (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RouteAttribute`, not the one in MVC of course) to cause the trimmer to preserve that type, including all public API, then that would be ideal but I'm not sure the trimmer has a mechanism for this.

> [DynamicComponent.cs(70,17)]

I suspect you're right that the existing annotation is ineffective. It was put there in reaction to trimmer warnings (IIRC).

Regarding the AddAttribute overload proposal, I'm not certain how/if it would work. The point of `DynamicComponent` is to use it with type values that vary at runtime, not just with fixed values. That is, people don't commonly write:

```razor
<DynamicComponent Type=""typeof(SomeComponent)"" />
```

... they commonly write:

```razor
<DynamicComponent Type=""@github"" />

@github {
    Type chosenComponentType;
}
```

So isn't this still an unknowable type as far as the trimmer is concerned? It's not performing some more sophisticated static analysis to work out the possible range of values for `chosenComponentType` based on assignments elsewhere, is it?

If I'm understanding, it seems like:

 * In general we'll continue to expect people not to use it with framework components
 * Most uses with application components are fine because application assemblies aren't trimmed
 * In the edge case of a trim-enabled RCL, people will have to write some other annotation either in their RCL or their application code to say they want to preserve the types they know they'll be using dynamically

If I'm wrong about this, please let me know as that would be great news :)

> [LayoutView.cs(59,24):]

The trimmer's concern (based on the warning) seems not to be about line 59, but about line 60, because the `layoutType` variable gets populated by `GetParentLayoutType` which doesn't declare anything about its return value being preserved. It seems like we *could* annotate `GetParentLayoutType`, but TBH I don't really follow why this would be the right place to annotate this.

I would have thought we should be annotating `LayoutAttribute` so that it knows that its constructor parameter (`Type layoutType`) indicates that we need to preserve the whole of `layoutType` as a component. If that was done, then it seems like `LayoutView` doesn't really need to trigger any preservation of anything, since we already know that all components used as layouts are already preserved. We'd just need to suppress any warnings that emerge from `LayoutView`. This seems like it should work since `[Layout]` is always set statically with a fixed literal type value for the constructor.

Please let me know if I'm misinterpreting all of this!

> [RouteView.cs(80,17):] It seems like there could be a legitimate issue here that could be fixed by annotating the LayoutAttribute constructor parameter with [DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.All)].

Right, yes! It seems like you're stating the same thing I was suggesting above. So maybe the constructor parameter annotation could solve both of these last two cases. As long as the routable page component itself is preserved, then `[Layout]` should cause its layout component to be preserved, and in turn any chain of ancestor layouts."
"feels weird for the service to have both these methods.  Feels like we'd just want one method, and perhaps have these two as extension methods that both call into that one core method.  (note: i may be wrong about this)."

"Just to speak to why I'm hesitant to make changes here, I want to make the insertion as simple as possible. Since we're copying everything over from liveshare, there's a lot to test and a lot to go wrong.

I can add an item to the project to come back to this once liveshare is using us, and test the changes here in isolation (which is what my plan has been so far).

The entire page is a list, including the breakpoint column. So when scrolling horizontally, it would be scrolled out of the view port. We need a way to fix it from scrolling horizontally. I have tried some methods that works for native table/list like position:sticky, but none of them work.

"> Once you do that, consider removing shell injection altogether. Instead, you can add a button that modifies ~/.zshrc. This would be in line with how zsh ecosystem works.

Our approach is somewhat atypical as most terminals are opt-in with an install step. If I remember right kitty auto installs it and some of the feedback they got was that it's intrusive, which I agree with, so we were trying to be as unintrusive as possible. As soon as you have a manual step the amount of users that would engage with the feature would drop significantly. This is an important part of why we too this approach, we want it to _just work_ for the majority of users and fail unobtrusively for more advanced cases. Imagine connecting VS Code to a container or a new machine, opening a terminal and shell integration/autocomplete just works with zero config, that's the vision.

In the off chance that shell integration fails to inject before the shell starts, or the shell disables it, or something else goes wrong, we want to fail early and continue, then the user has the option to disable injection all together and go with the manual setup route we'll provide https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/issues/5219

This discussion is all super valuable so thank you so much for that! It was probably obvious that I'm not that familiar with zsh, I'm mostly a bash and pwsh user these days.

"> The better (and simpler) question to ask is whether the cacheVariableType as calculated above refers to any method type parameters (I mean from any method) after the substitution. 

Consider the following code. In this case the lambda refers to another method type parameter but there is nothing wrong to cache the delegate because the type parameter has larger scope than the cache.

{
    for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++)

"That's a good idea, but without the commit with create-unions-of-accessors-as-accessors, it adds a weird wrinkle when synthetic properties *are* all accessors: specifically, if you modify accessorsOverrideProperty9 so that all bases use accessors (as in your other comment), then the error shows up again: the base symbol is synthetic, but all 3 bases are accessors, so the exemption no longer applies.

Instead, execution falls through to the flags check, but the flags are wrong, so the error message is wrong.

It's probably more correct to change the way synthetic accessors are created, but it's a much further-reaching change, and most of this code is still needed. I'd rather have a more pressing reason than this to change the code that creates synthetic accessors."
"@github
Thanks a lot for the review. 
The review comments are pretty reasonable, and I strongly agree with them. It is why I left a comment about nearly all of problems https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/38839#issuecomment-973769448
Maybe I could fix `//@github` and remove the commented optimize code.
But I am not sure about throw error. I think we need to discuss the behavior.
``` ts
enum FooKind {
    one,
    two,
    three,
}

interface Foo {
    kind: FooKind
}

function FooFunc(tmp: Foo) {
    switch (tmp.kind) {
        case FooKind.one:
            break;
        case FooKind.two:
            break;
        case FooKind.three:
            break;
        default:
            tmp; // what should here be? should it be `Foo` or `never`?
    }
}   
```
In the new PR, I narrow `tmp` to never, otherwise, what could it be?

Now, let's say we have code `assertNever(tmp.foo)`
I have no idea about what I should do, if I do not change, the build will failed because bootstrap is one step of check(in bootstrap, it will say `tmp` is never, so `tmp.kind` is wrong), if I change it to `assertNever(tmp)`, the build also failed, because tmp is not never now. Do I get something wrong? It would be glad to know there are some methods to fix it correctly!"
"Related to the topic (the info for future readers): here is https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/40101 which allows to use the above technique even without having baseUrl defined (if so, `paths` array values are related to the current config's directory). Which is cool.

Motivation: we switched to within-module-all-relative paths (../../..), and we wanted to have no baseUrl defined anywhere at all. Because it's safer: without baseUrl, VSCode won't even propose non-relative imports in auto-import IntelliSense feature, it would always propose ../.. paths, and there would be no risk of leaking ""wrong"" paths to generated dist/*.js files. (In the past we used typescript-transform-paths, but now we moved off it to reduce complexity.)

Here is the final workable layout. It also illustrates the case when folders in packages/* have different names than package names in package.json files (""my-"" prefix) - not something to be proud of though, but in case it's needed, it works too.

"Nice catch!

Does the test take a long time to run, should it be Pri1 or longRunningGC test?

looks like we catch this problem with our asserts but it makes it hard to understand what exactly goes wrong in release and why it leads to bad execution.


I think your test uncovers a bigger issue with `FIELD struct (1 field with the same size)`  transformation like this:
```
LocalAddressVisitor visiting statement:
STMT00017 (IL   ???...  ???)
               [000059] --C---------              *  RETURN    struct

Replacing the field in promoted struct with local var V13

               [000059] --C---------              *  RETURN    struct
               [000149] ------------              \--*  LCL_VAR   ref    V13 tmp9 
```
that can be hit not only for `ref` and not only for trees under return.

I have added another condition to your test so now it fails with the same assert but for `TYP_LONG` so your new condition does not guard against that, but maybe it can't lead to bad execution in release.

[Runtime_44895.modified.txt](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/files/5651339/Runtime_44895.modified.txt)

I think there are 2 main questions:
1. Is it correct to have `GT_OP struct -> LCL_VAR ref` for GC tracking? We are lucky here because there is a limited number of trees which can have struct type and can use `FIELD` as a child (I can think of `RETURN`, `ASG`, `STORE_*`), so we can check all.
2. Should we allow such cases in `gtNewTempAssign`?
3. How big are the diffs if we forbid the optimization in `fgMorphStructField` for 5.0? As I said we don't many `GT_OP struct -> FIELD` cases, so maybe we won't see many regressions?

"@github thanks for pointing that out. I checked again and it seems like the best way to move forward is to just emit these events using the WriteEventCore APIs for Mono instead of the QCalls since Mono doesn't have the same native event stubs that CoreCLR does, and there's doesn't seem to be a concept of native runtime events from Mono.

By the time the failure noted in dotnet/performance#1928 happens we have exited the venv. This actually seems to me to be an issue with helix or something else having gone wrong on our machines.

We shouldn't be using the null-forgiving `!` in this case to work around the compiler warning, but rather handle the case when `propertyInfo` is null correctly. This is what I was referring to earlier.

> Not sure adding a `Debug.Assert` right before the last throw adds much value, as there'll be a null ref anyway (which will be encountered in debug mode) if `propertyInfo` is null.

If it is not possible for `propertyInfo` to be null in this case (because you have reasoned about the code and the various states, which the compiler is unable to do in this case), then adding a `Debug.Assert` is useful in catching the null ref bug at development time when the code evolves over time so that the person making the change can see that something went wrong, especially if they accidentally break this invariant (and then can update this method/add tests accordingly). The `Debug.Assert` conveys intent more clearly, imo, particularly when the code changes and test coverage may not be 100%. Otherwise, using the `!` will just hide the null ref until the customer hits it."

For things which are only needed if some other managed class/method is used we should try to move the dependencies there - to improve trimability. We do care about size even for apps which have enabled debugger support for example.

I don't have a problem with both:
* Adding feature support to `DynamicDependencyAttribute`
* Allowing `DynamicDependencyAttribute` on types (the meaning would be that if we decide to keep the type in any way or form, those dependencies would kick in)

To make progress I think that we should take the changes as Eric wrote them here, it's an improvement as it makes the debugger stuff conditional on a feature switch. And once we have the necessary bits in the linker, we can improve on it by moving more of the local dependencies closer to where they belong."

It does.  It has a fallback where it makes a second FAR request, filtered to definitions, if the first returns exactly two results.  If exactly one is a definition, it jumps between them.  The current (and, I believe, preserved) behavior is that an import counts as a declaration of a separate, alias symbol, so an exported symbol that is exported in exactly one place will cause GTD to hop between the two (since neither is a definition from the other's perspective)."
"> I have undone the changes that were causing following child symlinks by default, this in order to behave similar to windows.

So then this PR is just making a change to follow the symlink if it is the root directory watched, is that correct?  Is that the same as Windows?

I didn't want to imply any sort of right/wrong judgement with my previous comment around following symlinks of child directories.  I actually think that could be seen as an interesting feature that is easier for us to do on Linux due to the way the watching APIs work (we already need to traverse and add and their is a flag for following).  The feature could also be added to the Windows implementation if we shared some of the code that traverses, just rather than add directories it finds (not necessary since ReadDirectoryChanges can be recursive), it could add symlinks it finds.  Interestingly enough if we did that, it would actually be similar to what would be needed to make a complete symlink following solution for Linux as well, since it could cover the symlink-ed file case.  

> It seems there is people in both sides of ""having follow semantics as the default"" or ""make follow links opt-in"" so I think it would not be great to allow that here.

Agreed. I think it'd be possible to have a complete symlink following file-watcher, thought it should probably be opt-in.  IMHO  such a feature would be a nice complement to the other symlink API that's being worked on and would probably be more impactful than this change.  You might consider doing it instead of this change if this change was causing our behaviors to diverge on platforms.  If not then this seems fine."

Well, even for non-leaf functions, there would be a problem if the LR was used as a general purpose register between calls.
The real problem is that with the arm64 mechanism of making calls we cannot make unwinding of injected frame to get LR after the unwind to be different from the PC.

"> how did you undo the changes, it's a lot of changes and a large code base

Revert wasn't ideal because:
- There were a lot of conflicts due to code merged since. 
- A fair amount of new use of `!!` has been added since.
- Rolling out `!!` fixed a decent number of (minor) bugs, e.g. wrong parameter name used, missing parameter name, missing tests, argument exceptions propagating asynchronously instead of synchronously out of iterators and async methods, etc. 
- We actually don't want what was there before but instead to use ThrowIfNull, as it's more concise and results in more efficient code, and `!!` is a good indicator of where it can/should be used (`!!` effectively generated ThrowIfNull calls). 

My process:
1. Started by using VS to find expression-bodied members using `!!` and applying a refactoring to make them normal bodies. Most of these were in one LINQ-related file. 
2. Searched for async in combination with `!!` to manually do the ""right thing"" in terms of exceptions propagating synchronously. This found some bugs where we weren't doing it correctly prior to `!! `. Did the same searching for IEnumerable to find iterators, also finding a few bugs `!!` had fixed.
3. Searched for use of `!!` on signatures with this/base delegation to manually handle cases where the check needed to be before delegation. 
4. Wrote a Roslyn-based console app to find all `!!` on parameters, remove them, and add in an appropriate ThrowIfNull call. That handled 95% of the changes. 
5. Searched for ones my tool missed (I knew it would miss some but it was cheaper to do the rest manually than to make the tool bullet-proof), e.g. use on indexers, and fixed those manually. 
6. Built, fixed errors (primarily projects that couldn't use ThrowIfNull), rinsed and repeated until clean. 
7. Manually code-reviewed ~1400 files. Most of the issues here were around trivia my tool didn't handle appropriately, e.g. pragmas at the beginning of a method that got messed up.
8. Mentally praised `!!` and all that it accomplished for us in its few months with us, and put up the PR. "
"I think there is NullFileProvider.Instance, but I might be wrong."
"This is a bit awkward - sorry I didn't anticipate this when we discussed the design.

In general the intent is for the core `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` package not to make assumptions about the UI rendering technology. As such it doesn't assume that the UI renderer is a browser that would even have an associated JS runtime. The concept of ""web browser"" is in higher layers (e.g., `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Browser`). The reason for this is to keep open the possibility that we allow completely different UI rendering technologies, such as native apps. So, AFAIK (and please correct me if I'm wrong), there aren't any other places in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` where the framework makes JS interop calls.

To avoid making a JS interop call directly from here, we might need to add a new interface method. We could either:

 * Put a new method, `EnableNavigationInterception`, onto `IUriHelper` (since there are different implementations of that in different environments). It might be a bit weird for this to be public, though.
 * Or make a new internal DI service for enabling navigation interception. It could be a new interface `INavigationInterception` where the existing non-abstract `IUriHelper` implementations (server and WebAssembly variants) also implement that, so there's not much extra code or config to implement. The new interface would just be to segregate it from `IUriHelper` so it doesn't pollute intellisense.

We define two attributes: `CreateHubProxyAttribute` and `RegisterHubProxyAttribute` that users place on a method they define in their project.

This would put the method ownership into users hands so we can avoid the issues mentioned earlier.

The attributes should probably go into the [Client.Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/main/src/SignalR/clients/csharp/Client.Core/src) package.

Example:
```csharp
public class UserClass
{

        var proxy = hubConnection.MyHubProxy<THub>();
        hubConnection.RegisterMyProxy<IClientHub>(new ClientHub());
    }

    [CreateHubProxy]
    static partial THub MyHubProxy<THub>(this HubConnection);

    [RegisterHubProxy]

`yield return` is illegal in a lambda. This code was always wrong.
This is a bit crazy to do because for each editor that gets moved it will be opened in the target group causing an editor switch. It would be much smoother if the move would happen with the editors opening `inactive` on the target group and only the last one would actually be `active`. There is an option that can be set when opening an editor called `inactive` that I think we should wire into the moveEditor call so that we can optimize for this (for the `openEditor` call [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/editor/editorPart.ts#L866)).

> I agree with that. But I don't agree with the approach that has been picked. You should not be reading and evaluating context keys. Instead you should be more like an ""event source"" and we should own the tuple [event, when-clause, command] - just like we do it for keybindings. Something like this
> 
> 1. extension registers event source
> 2. vscode allows to bind events to commands using when-clauses
> 3. extension fires event -> vscode evaluates the binding (using the focused/active element) and invokes the command

So I think an approach like this would solve about a third of the issue, which I guess might make it a good place to start depending on how complex impl would be.  I will try to explain the other 2/3 that's missing from this solution, though.  There are basically two issues not addressed, but I think I can lump them into one with an example.  Here's a sample talon file (the details of kaldi active grammar will likely be different but I'd imagine similar concepts apply; but correct me if I'm wrong here @github):

```
tag: user.terminal
-
make directory: ""mkdir""
```

This code tells talon that when I am in a terminal context, it should listen for me to say ""make directory"", and in response it will simulate keyboard events as if I have typed `mkdir` on my keyboard.  I am not sure I understand how your proposed solution would handle this case.  Somehow talon needs to know that I am in a terminal context in order to activate this command.  A few high-level possibilities for how this might be done:

a) Support a few specific when-clause contexts as contextual substitution variables in the `""window.title""` setting, eg `terminalFocus` and `inQuickOpen`.  Talon has machinery for tracking window titles that is commonly used to solve problems like this.
b) Support a notification and lookup system that tracks what the when-clause context would be if the user were to type a character right now
c) Support just the lookup system from b), so that we can poll this information
d) Pick a few specific when-clause contexts, such as `terminalFocus` and `inQuickOpen`, and create specific apis to query and receive events for them
e) Same as d) but no events, so we'd have to poll for this info

I guess in theory I could solve half of the issue here using your proposed solution with the `workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence` command.  I'd bind an event that triggers this command, qualified by the `terminalFocus` when-clause context.  This only solves half the problem, though, because I'd need to have this command active in talon all the time, so it would still be polluting my command grammar, making misrecognitions more likely, although when it does misfire at least it would end up being a no-op.  But this trick still wouldn't help me with `inQuickOpen`.  

Fwiw, the contexts that I am most interested in are the following:
- `terminalFocus`
- `inQuickOpen`
- `editorFocus`

"You know I was curious whether MSVC properly optimizes `std::string_view` and I tried:
```c++

}

```asm

        mov     esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
        jmp     foo(std::basic_string_view<char, std::char_traits<char> >)
```

This is MSVC (`/O2 /Oi /std:c++17`):
```asm
`string' DB 'aaaaaaaa', 00H         ; `string'

"You're right, I didn't think about this issue ;  however (and sorry if this a bit dumb) but how would equivalence keys help here ?

The way I would fix this is at line 75, within `FixAllAsync`, by only processing the diagnostic that have the same safety property as the current code action :

- add `private bool _isSafe` to the codefix provider class

- change `RegisterCodeFixesAsync`'s from `var isSafe = /* ... */` to `_isSafe = /* ... */`

- change `FixAllAsync`'s foreach loop to :
```csharp
foreach (var diagnostic in diagnostics.Where(d => _isSafe == d.Properties.TryGetValue(""safe"")) { /* ... */ }
```

I (very quickly) tested it and it seems to prevent codefixes to affect the wrong version. Would this approach work ?

The point is that we need to bundle the files in the net6 pack for Windows, that's all we are doing.

With SslStream we specify the TargetHost separately from the address that we actually connect to. It seems like perhaps that is not possible using msquic? If so, I think we are best off just ignoring TargetHost here.

"> Do we really need to rewrite all of the vectorized code everywhere?

Need to? No.
* Although in the example link you provided there are improvement in .NET 6/7 that would let you simplify some of that logic. We added support for `Vector<nint>` and `Vector<nuint>` so you could merge the `if (IntPtr.Size == 8) {} else {}` paths.

There was an ask above by Stephen for guidance on when the right choice is `Vector<T>` vs `Vector64<T>` vs `Vector128<T>` vs `Vector256<T>`.

There is a lot of nuance here and the guidance I want to write is just that, guidance. Everyone's scenarios are different and hardware is constantly evolving. It's why the architecture optimization manuals are all several hundred pages long. It's a lot like the Framework Design Guidelines where there are some `DOs` some `DO NOTs` some `CONSIDERs` and some `you can always ignore everything here if you know better or your scenario calls for it`.

There is nothing ""wrong"" with using `Vector<T>`, `Vector128<T>`, or `Vector256<T>`. But each come with various annotations and considerations.

The biggest consideration of `Vector<T>` is that it is variable sized. If your inputs are commonly between 16 and 32 bytes (or between 32 and 64 bytes in cases like this PR where it does `Vector<T>.Count * 2`) then you will not get SIMD acceleration when using `Vector<T>` on hardware with AVX2 support.

The biggest consideration of `Vector128<T>` is that you *could* leave some perf on the table if your inputs are commonly ""big"". Big here however is relative and dependent on a few factors. It could be 32-bytes and it could be 128-bytes (it could even be some other number altogether).

The biggest consideration of `Vector256<T>` is that you will not be able to use that path on anything other than modern x86/x64 hardware.

-------------------------

If you are trying to get good performance everywhere and don't need to support .NET Standard. `Vector128<T>` is a good option. `Vector<T>` can also be a good option but comes with more considerations over `Vector128<T>`. Optionally including `Vector256<T>` can then be beneficial.

If you are trying to get the best performance everywhere, you are going to be writing complicated code and maintaining multiple paths; particularly if you need to consider both small and large inputs."

Hrm this is an interesting one. It seems like there is not a perfect solution here -- fetch API seems poorly made. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Without setting a normal redirect status code, we break compat with any existing code handling redirects.

But, it seems wrong to fake a status code when we don't know what the actual status code was. If we were to fake a status code, a temporary redirect seems like the best choice -- permanent redirect could cause dangerous handling e.g. updating a URI in a database.

To add a third bad option, what do we think of this? It at least gives the user some flexibility here.

```c#
public class BrowserHttpHandler
{
    public const HttpStatusCode OpaqueRedirect = (HttpStatusCode)1000;

    // if false, return TemporaryRedirect. if true, return OpaqueRedirect.
    public bool ReturnOpaqueRedirect { get; set; } = false;
}

"> Well, mistakes in past doesn't justify repeating them, especially if we know we could have done it better :)

True. But, if the past mistakes are so prevalent in the existing design, those mistakes can actually _become_ the design. And, trying to do improve upon that results in inconsistency. I believe that's the case here.

> If ""Suggestion"" gets the vote for being a new severity, why not ""Unnecessary""?

I keep repeating this, but ""Unnecessary"" is _intended_ to be combined with a severity. It is 100% by design that code could be faded as ""unnecessary"" and be squiggled as an error. This was designed from the very beginning. Likewise, code can be unnecessary and marked as a suggestion.

> I don't agree with this. Firstly, custom tags are associated with descriptors, i.e. rule metadata, not individual diagnostic instances. Rule metadata represents default information about category of issues created through the descriptor, as deemed appropriate by the analyzer author. Even the unnecessary custom tag added to faded diagnostic becomes non-sensical if user promotes the diagnostic to an error. We need to understand that custom tags is just metadata for class of diagnostics reported via a descriptor.

How is it non-sensical if a user promotes a faded diagnostic to an error? If the user wants to promote remove redundant cast to an error, they should be able to do that and the diagnostic should continue to be faded (because it represents unnecessary code) and underlined with a red squiggle (because it is an error).

That said, ""suggestion"" is a different concept that ""unnecessary"". ""Errors"", ""Warnings"", and ""Suggestions"" are mutually exclusive, which implies that using a custom tag for ""Suggestion"" is a fragile design with invalid combinations.

To be super clear, we're not suggesting that we should allow the DiagnosticSeverity enum to explode. However, after spending the last couple of years building analyzers, and looking at the problem space we believe that there is simply a missing severity. This severity is not so strong as to warrant a warning to inform the user that something is truly wrong with their code. Instead, it is slightly weaker, offering a suggestion to improve the user's code.

You're completely right that suggestions could be achieved by using the Info severity with a custom tag. However, I would argue that we'd just be simulating a severity in that case. And, if we're contemplating the simulation of a severity, I argue that it deserves to be a severity. Otherwise, it becomes an extra complication that every diagnostic host needs handle properly.

"> On combining diagnostic IDs: I didn't make any changes as of now. I have a preference for not combining the messages themselves (""either X or Y is wrong""). Because of the way localization works, I don't know if it's possible to vary the message wording for the same diagnostic ID.

The unit of translation is usually a single diagnostic message. We sometimes parameterize based on simple discriminators e.g. saying ""type"" versus ""method"", but nothing more complex than that. I'm happy with your preference, so feel free to leave the diagnostics as is :)"

"> Just curious as I am not knowledgeable about timezones -- what would be the impact of the user picking the wrong one of the several Alaska time zones? They are all -9:00. I'm not sure which -8:00 I should pick for Seattle, even when they are marked Los Angeles and Vancouver.

@github - Indeed, that's a general issue with time zones - there are quite a lot of them.  The reason has to do with historical accuracy.  IANA time zones aim to be accurate from 1970 forward, thus any variation in local time between nearby locations since 1970 get a distinct time zone.

For Alaska, the only two that matter *today* are `America/Anchorage` (UTC-9 with US DST rules) and `America/Adak` (UTC-10 with US DST rules).  But if we look at the [source data](https://github.com/eggert/tz/blob/336c8f8262e31116878b079abba80b1626baaa8f/northamerica#L670-L731) we can see that several other Alaskan time zones have been different in the past (last in 1983 in most cases, except Metlakatla last in 2019).  Since any time zone can be used for the full range of dates available, we show the entire list and it gets large.

For Pacific time, there are three.  Vancouver for Canada, Los Angeles for the USA, and Tijuana for Mexico.  They too have had some historical differences.

Thus, the impact if a user choses the wrong time zone is that they get the changes in UTC offsets and daylight start/stop transition dates for the entire range of that time zone.  If they are only working with ""now"" or nearby dates, that might not be noticed at all.  If they are working with older dates, they could be off by an hour or more depending on the date in question.  The same thing plays out with regard to any anticipated upcoming changes for future dates, if those changes are accounted for in their respective time zones.

Since the only API we have presently is `TimeZoneInfo.GetSystemTimeZones()`, we have to return them *all*.   It might be interesting to consider adding an overload or two that would allow one to supply cut-off dates (or a country code) that could be used to shorten the list.  But that would be something new.

Incidentally, legacy Windows registry-based time zones are fewer in number only because originally Windows hadn't set any particular consistency date (like IANA's 1970).  That changed in 2016 when we formalized some of [Microsoft's time zone policies](https://aka.ms/time) and set a consistency date of 2010.  If they had aimed for 1970 and covering the world, there would be just as many as IANA.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/54021

`fr-CA` culture is using time format pattern like `HH 'h' mm 'min' ss 's'` which is causing 2 problems:
- First, we usually derive the time separator from the time pattern. That causing us to use ` h ` as time separator. So, when formatting any DateTime object using this culture we produce wrong formatted time e.g. `10 h 5 h 50 h`. note that ` h ` is used to separate the hour, minute, and second parts in the formatted string.
- Second, the formatted time cannot parse back when using `DateTime.Parse`. This is because we cannot recognize the parts like `min' and 's' in the formatted time.

The fix here is we are special casing this culture to explicitly setting the time separator to `:` which is other French cultures are using. Also, we added some support for this culture in the date/time parser to recognize such formats.

This is a fix to enable nullable check for the
""Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions""
by enabling using netcoreapp3.1 and the latest version
of .net core, including:

1. Enable ""Nullable"".
2. Change some missing / wrong comments in the XML document.
3. Add ""NotNull"" for some functions whose parameter CANNOT be null.
4. Add ""NotNullIfNotNull"" for some functions when they can accept
   nullable values.

"When a user configures a task, we select that task in the tasks.json so it's easy to find. We find the task by label.
However, extension contributed task that are configured in tasks.json aren't required to have a label, making them difficult to find.

Looking at a few of the larger diffs I realized that the existing version of redundant branch opts has a bug; if the tree VN is a constant than the outcome of the branch it controls is independent of any dominating branch, but we were (previously) using inferencing here. This lead to at least one instance where we made the wrong deduction, 57396 in coreclr_tests. Fixing this keeps a bunch of code around that should never have been deleted. I added a note to the code indicating that checking for the constant case is necessary and not just nice to have.

Seemingly these constant VN relops are somewhat rare and having more than one in the right arrangement even rarer, which is why we haven't seen complaints about this before.

```

Fall through successor BB02 of BB01 reaches, relop must be false
```

The other large regression 247114 from libraries_tests.pmi also has constant cases but there we ended up getting it right as the dominating predicate was the same predicate (here $42 is 0)
```

The large regression in this method seems to come from LSRA finding many more single-def cases to spill upfront. Did not try and drill into this further.

"Thanks for figuring it out. This would have almost might have made every possible loop's size calculated wrong (it will go all the way to end of the method) and leading to most of the loops being not aligned because of heuristic not met. This would also explain the regression in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/69444.

Does this fix completely remove the checked vs. release diffs?"
"> Looks cool. Just the one case where windows may have a window without a content yet. We may always have a root panel, but maybe some custom handler does not use it.
> 
> Can we do the XamlRoot and get that parent? The root view should have the window as the parent?

XamlRoot doesn't have a parent as far as I can see. That's the topmost level I can get to from the looks of it. From what I can see that _should_ be enough. If the Content for a XamlRoot is null, then the FrameworkElement shouldn't belong to that MAUI IWindow. If you have a FrameworkElement that exists in some other WinUI Window that is totally unrelated to MAUI, and for whatever reason call this API, then the XamlRoot will be wrong for all of the MAUI managed windows and it will return null (which I would expect).

Even if you are doing custom handlers and not using the RootPanel, the XamlRoot on the UIWindow should still be on a MAUI IWindow as well, and if it's not it will return null.

"@github looks my suggestion was wrong :(
`D:\a\_work\1\s\src\Core\src\Platform\Android\StrokeExtensions.cs(18,4): error CS8602: Dereference of a possibly null reference. [D:\a\_work\1\s\src\Core\src\Core.csproj]`

I didn't know why since there is a check for null right before"
"This doesn't actually help:
```xml
<KnownFrameworkReference ...>
  <RuntimePackAlwaysCopyLocal Condition="" '$(UseMaui)' == 'true' "">true</RuntimePackAlwaysCopyLocal>
```

So I'm unsure what is wrong here... It's like it's not picking up these from dotnet/packs?

Previously, these `@(KnownFrameworkReference)` would not be added to this project at all."
"Holy smokes, that's a crazy bug. From 10-12 minutes to 22 seconds. Excellent find @github !"
"These are debug logs. If typescript made it easy to turn regular enums to strings, I would consider it as part of this change.

But as it stands, I have to either change the enum to a ""string enum"" or add a look up table. Not crazy, but not necessary as part of this change."
Wrong capitalization of `jQuery`. Is this wrong in other templates?
"@github I must be doing something slightly wrong in updating the test, now that confirmation is required I had to add a few more clicks before the account should be logged in, but it doesn't look like the fetch data works still, anything obviously wrong with this test update?"
